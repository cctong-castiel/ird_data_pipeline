**8\. Commentary**

Under Section 14 of the IRO, every person who carries on a trade, business
or profession in Hong Kong is chargeable to profits tax on the profits arising
in or derived from Hong Kong. In the present case, the Company has no business
carried on in Hong Kong and it does nothing in Hong Kong to earn the
commission in question, therefore Section 14 does not apply.
