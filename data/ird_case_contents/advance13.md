(c) | A summary of purchases is then forwarded by Company L, by e-mail, to the respective Distribution Companies for approval. If applicable, the latter confirm approval to Company L by e-mail. Acceptance or rejection of an order is based on the worldwide pricing guidelines established by the group head office.

Once the products are shipped, the Manufacturing Companies forward or fax the shipping documents to Company L, which issues invoices to the Asian Marketing Companies under the letterheads of the Distribution Companies.
