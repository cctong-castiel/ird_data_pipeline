## INTRODUCTION

These practice notes lay down broad statements on the practice to be adopted by the Department in relation to the taxation responsibilities of persons in Hong  Kong  who  may  be  chargeable to Profits Tax on behalf of non-residents.

## THE POSITION IN GENERAL

2. A  non-resident  who  carries  on  a  trade,  profession  or  business  in Hong Kong is chargeable to Profits Tax under section 14 in respect of profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong from such trade, profession or business. Thus,  for  example,  a  non-resident  entertainer  or  sportsman  who  performs  in Hong Kong is chargeable to Profits Tax in respect of the payment he derives from  his  performance  here.  In  addition,  a  non-resident  person  who  does  not carry on business in Hong Kong and who may have no physical presence here is  still  liable  to  Profits  Tax  if,  for  example,  he  receives  sums  in  the  form  of royalties  or  licence  fees  for  the  use  of  or  right  to  use  in  Hong  Kong  certain industrial or intellectual property. Such receipts are deemed by section 15(1) to arise  in  or  be  derived  from  Hong  Kong  from  a  trade,  profession  or  business carried  on  in  Hong  Kong. These receipts comprise sums received or accrued from the exhibition or use in Hong Kong of cinema or television film or tape, any  sound  recording,  or  any  advertising  material  connected  with  such  items [section 15(1)(a)] and sums received or accrued for the use of or right to use in Hong Kong any patent, design, trademark, copyright material, secret process or formula  or similar property, or for imparting  or undertaking  to impart knowledge  connected  with  such  items  [section  15(1)(b)].    Following  the enactment of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Ordinance 2004, the scope of taxable receipts is extended to cover sums received or accrued for the use of or right  to  use  outside  Hong  Kong  the  intellectual  properties  enumerated  in section  15(1)(b),  which  are  deductible  in  ascertaining  assessable  profits  of  a person for  the  purpose  of  Profits  Tax  [section  15(1)(ba)].    This  new  section does not apply to sums received or accrued before 25 June 2004.

## THE  ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION  PROVISIONS - SECTION  20A

3. For many years the Department has relied on section 20A to enable the  tax  due  by  a  non-resident  to  be  assessed  and  collected  even  where  the non-resident has no physical presence in Hong Kong. The terms of section 20A provide that a non-resident person may be assessed directly or in the name of his agent in respect of his profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong from any trade, profession or business carried on in Hong Kong. The section further provides that the tax so charged shall be recoverable from the assets of the nonresident or his agent. The term 'agent' in relation to a non-resident is defined in section 2 to include :-
2. (a) the agent, attorney, factor, receiver or manager in Hong Kong of such person, and
3. (b) any  person  in  Hong  Kong  through  whom  such  person  is  in receipt  of  any  profits  or  income  arising  in  or  derived  from Hong Kong.

Until  a  High  Court  decision  in  1987  (referred  to  in  paragraph  4  below)  the Department  took  the  view  that  any  person  in  Hong  Kong  who  paid  to  a non-resident sums in respect of which the non-resident was assessable to tax in Hong Kong was an agent in terms of the above definition. Consequently, that person  in  Hong  Kong  could  be  charged  to  Profits  Tax  under  section  20A  as agent of the non-resident. In the light of that court decision the Department's view is no longer tenable.

## INTERPRETATION OF 'AGENT'

4. The meaning of 'agent' was brought before the High Court in CIR v. Asia  Television  Limited  [1987]    2  HKTC  198 . The  case  concerned  the payment of licence fees by Asia Television Limited (ATV) to a non-resident film  distribution  company  under  a  licence  agreement  to  broadcast  in  Hong Kong films supplied by the non-resident.    The licence fees were paid directly by ATV to the non-resident outside Hong Kong.    Such fees are chargeable to Profits Tax under section 15(1)(a).    Assessments were raised on ATV as agent for non-resident. On appeal the High Court held that in the circumstances of the

case  the  non-resident  was  in  receipt  of  income  not  through  but  rather  from ATV.  Consequently  ATV  was  not  an  'agent'  as  defined  and  could  not  be charged  under section 20A  in  respect of the licence fees paid to the non-resident. It followed, of course, that the non-resident could only be charged by direct assessment.

5. As  a  result  of  the  ATV  decision,  the  Department  is  unable  to  use section  20A  to  assess  non-residents  where  the  Hong  Kong  person  and  the non-resident deal with each other on a principal to principal basis, as was the situation  in  the  ATV  case.  Because  it  is  not  uncommon  for  non-residents  in receipt  of  royalties  and  licence  fees  from  Hong  Kong  and  for  non-resident entertainers and sportsmen who perform in Hong Kong to derive income not through  a  Hong  Kong  agent  but  from  a  Hong  Kong  principal,  it  has  been necessary to amend the law to restore the position, as far as possible, to that which was thought to have existed prior to the ATV decision.

## THE ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION  PROVISIONS - SECTION 20B

6. Against this background the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Ordinance  1989  introduced  a  new  section  20B  which  applied  from  1  April 1989. It should be noted, however, that section 20A has remained unchanged and  continues  to  apply  in  situations  where  the  Hong  Kong  payer  is  truly  an agent  of  the  non-resident.    Section  20B  only  applies  to  situations  where persons  in  Hong  Kong  who  are  not  agents  deal  with  a  specified  class  of non-residents.  In  essence  this  class  comprises  non-residents  in  receipt  of royalties and licence fees from Hong Kong and non-resident entertainers and sportsmen who perform in Hong Kong.
7. Following  the  enactment  of  the  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment) Ordinance 2004, the coverage of section 20B is expanded.    The section now applies in respect of a non-resident who is chargeable to Profits Tax in respect of :-
3. (a) sums deemed under section 15(1)(a), (b) or (ba) to be receipts derived from Hong Kong from a trade, profession or business carried on in Hong Kong, in other words, royalties and licence fees;or

- (b) sums received in respect of the performance in Hong Kong by a  non-resident  entertainer  or  sportsman  of  an  activity  as  an entertainer or sportsman on or in connection with a commercial  occasion  or  event,  including  appearance  in  any promotional activity or participation in any sound recording, films, videos, radio, television etc.
8. The Ordinance contains  no  definition  of  'non-resident  person'  but the  Department,  as  a  matter  of  administrative  practice,  has  long  accepted  in relation to section 20A that the term refers to a person who has no permanent business presence in Hong Kong. No difficulties or disputes have arisen on this point in the past and it is therefore not likely that the term will cause problems in  relation  to  section  20B. In  case  there  are  disputes,  the  term  will  be interpreted in accordance with the principles established by the courts.

## DEFINITION OF CERTAIN TERMS

9. The phrases 'entertainer or sportsman' and 'commercial occasion or event' are defined in section 20B(4). The definitions are largely self-explanatory and require little comment :-
2. 'Entertainer or sportsman' means a person, other than a corporation, who  gives  performances  in  any  kind  of  entertainment  or  sport, including any physical activity which the public is permitted to see or hear. In terms of the definition it matters not whether the activity is  in  a  live  or  recorded  form  or  whether  the  public  is  required  to make payment to see or hear.
3. 'Commercial occasion or event' includes any occasion or event for which an entertainer might receive cash or other form of property for his  performance,  or  any  occasion  or  event  designed  to  promote commercial sales or activity. As presently defined, it  is  considered that  the  phrase  will  cover  all  those  occasions  or  events,  whether commercial  or  charitable,  in  respect  of  which  an  entertainer  or sportsman might receive profits assessable to tax.

## ASSESSMENT IN NAME OF HONG KONG PERSON - SECTION 20B

10. Where section  20B  applies,  a  non-resident  person  is  chargeable  to tax  in  the  name  of  the  Hong  Kong  person  who  paid  or  credited  sums  (see paragraph  7)  to  him  or  any  other  non-resident.  In  addition,  section  20B(2) provides  that  the  tax  so  charged  is  recoverable  by  all  means  provided  in  the Ordinance from the Hong Kong person. Thus, where a Hong Kong person pays to  a  non-resident  royalties  or  licence  fees  in  the  circumstances  prescribed  by section  15(1)(a),  (b)  or  (ba),  he  will  be  chargeable  to  tax  on  behalf  of  the non-resident  in  respect  of  the  payment.  Similarly,  a  Hong  Kong  promoter  or sponsor  will  be  chargeable  in  respect  of  any  payment  made  by  him  to  a non-resident entertainer or sportsman for performing in Hong Kong.
11. It  should  be  noted  that  in  terms  of  section  20B(2)  the  Hong  Kong person would remain chargeable to tax on behalf of the non-resident even if the payment or credit was made to a non-resident other than the non-resident who is  chargeable by virtue of section 20B(1), for example, where the payment is made  to the manager of a non-resident entertainer who  is himself a non-resident. Section 20B would also be applicable where sums falling within subsection (1) were paid by a Hong Kong person to another Hong Kong person for the account of a non-resident. In this situation the other Hong Kong person would be chargeable on behalf of the non-resident.

## DEDUCTION OF TAX BY HONG KONG PERSON

12. Section 20B(3), like section 20A(2), requires the Hong Kong person from whom tax is recoverable, in other words, the person who is chargeable on behalf  of  the  non-resident,  to  deduct  at  the  time  he  pays  or  credits  the non-resident  a  sum  sufficient  to  meet  the  tax  due.  At  this  particular  time  no assessment may have been raised and in such case the Hong Kong payer should retain  the  sum  deducted  until  a  demand  note  calling  for  payment  is  received from the Department. Section 20B(3) also contains an indemnity to the Hong Kong person in respect of the sum deducted to meet the tax liability.

## THE AMOUNT OF TAX TO BE WITHHELD

13. In determining the amount of tax to be withheld by the Hong Kong person, in the case of royalties and licence fees falling within section 15(1)(a), (b) or (ba), the provisions of section 21A should be followed.    The operation of  section  21A  is  explained  in  the  Departmental  Interpretation  and  Practice Notes No. 22.
14. With regard to non-resident entertainers and sportsmen, the Department has for many years advised Hong Kong promoters to withhold tax on  the  basis  that  assessable  profits  represent  two-thirds  of  the  gross  receipts payable to the entertainer or sportsman. In other words, a deduction for expense equal  to  one-third  of  the  gross  proceeds  is  automatically  allowed  by  the Department in computing the assessable profits of a non-resident entertainer or sportsman.  This  arrangement  is,  from  a  strictly  legal  point  of  view,  properly authorised by section 21 which enables the assessable profits of a non-resident to be computed on a percentage of turnover. The Department will continue to apply this arrangement in the future. Non-residents are, of course, at liberty to make claims for deduction which are greater than the automatic allowance to which  I  have  referred  above.  However,  in  such  cases  the  Department  will require that full particulars of the expenses be produced and that such expenses be properly deductible in terms of the Ordinance.

## REPAYMENT OF TAX INVOLVING NON-RESIDENTS

15. Finally,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment) Ordinance 1989 also amends section 79(3) to provide that where a non-resident person has been assessed in the name of another person under section 20A or 20B and the tax so assessed has been paid by the other person, either the other person  or  the  non-resident,  but  not  both,  may  claim  repayment  of  any  tax overpaid. In this regard, the Department takes the view that the term 'another person'  in  section  79(3),  as  amended,  covers  both  an  'agent'  referred  to  in section 20A and 'any person in Hong Kong' in section 20B.
