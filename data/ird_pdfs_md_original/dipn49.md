## INTRODUCTION

## Relevant Legislation

The Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  (the  Ordinance)  has  been  amended several times since 1983 to allow deduction of capital expenditures incurred on the purchase of different types of intellectual property rights (IPRs) to promote their wider application in Hong Kong.

2. Section 16E, which was enacted in 1983 and amended in 1992 and 2011, relates to the deduction of capital expenditures incurred on the purchase of patent rights and rights to any know-how.
3. Sections 16EA, 16EB and 16EC of the Ordinance, which were enacted in 2011, relate to the deduction of capital expenditures incurred on the purchase of copyrights, registered designs and registered trade marks.    The scope was expanded in 2018 to cover performer's economic rights, protected layout-design (topography) rights and protected plant variety rights.
4. This Departmental Interpretation and Practice Note (DIPN) sets out the  views  and  practices  of  the  Department  regarding  the  deduction  of  capital expenditures  on  patent  rights,  rights  to  know-how,  copyrights,  performer's economic  rights,  protected  layout-design  (topography)  rights,  protected  plant variety rights, registered designs and registered trade marks.

## SCOPE OF THE TAX DEDUCTION

5. IPRs are intangible assets, representing the exclusive rights offered by law to  protect  a  person's  creation.    While  section  17(1)(c)  of  the  Ordinance generally prohibits the deduction of any expenditure of a capital nature, specific provisions in sections 16E and 16EA allow the deduction of capital expenditures incurred on the purchase of:
2. (a) patent rights and rights to any know-how; and
3. (b) copyrights,  performer's  economic  rights, protected layout design  (topography)  rights,  protected  plant  variety  rights, registered  designs or registered trade marks  (collectively referred to as specified intellectual property rights (SIPRs)).
6. Section 16E of the Ordinance provides that, subject to the satisfaction of the prescribed conditions, any capital expenditure incurred by a person on the purchase  of  patent  rights  or  rights  to  any  know-how,  for  use  in  his  trade, profession or business in the production of chargeable profits is allowable for deduction.    Section 16EA provides a similar deduction for capital expenditure incurred on the purchase of SIPRs.
7. Deduction of the capital expenditure incurred on purchase would be allowed  only  if  it  can  be  substantiated  that  the  right  concerned  constitutes  a patent right, a right to know-how or an SIPR.    Thus, in determining whether a right  falls  within  the  scope  of  deduction  as  defined  by  the  Ordinance,  the Assessor would make reference to the relevant statutory registration regime, if one exists, which provides an effective means to ascertain the nature of the right concerned (i.e. a patent right, a protected plant variety right, a registered design or a registered trade mark).    If a registration system does not exist for the right in question (i.e. a right to know-how, a copyright, a performer's economic right or a protected layout-design (topography) right), the relevant agreement for sale and purchase will be examined so as to ascertain the precise nature of the subject matter purchased.

## PATENT RIGHTS,  RIGHTS  TO  KNOW-HOW  AND  SPECIFIED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

## Patent rights

8. A patent gives its inventor and owner a legal right to prevent others from  manufacturing,  using,  selling  or  importing  the  patented  invention.    A patent  is,  in  effect,  a  limited  property  right  that  a  jurisdiction  grants  to  the inventor in exchange for his agreement to share the details of the invention with the public.    Registration and protection of patents operate on a territorial basis. A patent being an exclusionary right must be 'registered' with the jurisdiction of  such  right.    The  term  'patent  rights'  is  defined  in  section  16E(4)  of  the Ordinance to mean the right to do or authorize the doing of anything which would, but  for  that  right,  be  an  infringement  of  a  patent. Thus,  in  relation  to  a jurisdiction, any invention not registered with the jurisdiction does not fall within the term 'patent rights' and it is pertinent that deduction will only be allowed for the purchase cost of patent rights in respect of which grants from the relevant authorities have been obtained.

## Rights to know-how

9. Trade  secrets,  also  described  as  'know-how'  or  'show-how',  are protected commercially by maintaining secrecy within the business enterprises and by the use of confidentiality agreements.    There is no statutory registration for them.    The term 'know-how' is defined in section 16E(4) of the Ordinance to  mean  any  industrial  information  or  techniques  likely  to  assist  in  the manufacture or processing of goods or materials.    As a result of this definition, the deduction is confined to trade secrets and confidential information which are related to a manufacturing process.

## Specified intellectual property rights

## Definition

10. The term 'specified intellectual property right' is defined in section 16EA(11) of the Ordinance to mean a copyright, performer's economic right, protected layout-design (topography) right, protected plant variety right, registered design or registered trade mark (i.e. SIPRs).

## Copyrights

11. 'Copyright' is defined to mean:
2. (a) a copyright within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Copyright Ordinance (Cap. 528) (CO), including an unregistered corresponding  design  as  defined  by  section  87(5)(b)  of  that Ordinance; or
3. (b) any right that subsists  under the law  of a place outside  Hong Kong  in  any  work  in  which  a  copyright  referred  to  in  subparagraph  (a)  may  subsist  and  corresponds  to  a  copyright referred to in sub-paragraph (a).
12. According  to  section  2  of  the  CO,  'copyright'  is  a  property  right which subsists in the following descriptions of work:
5. (a) original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works;

- (b) sound recordings, films, broadcasts or cable programmes; and
- (c) the typographical arrangement of published editions.

Copyright is an automatic right which arises when a work is created and recorded in some way (e.g. on paper or electronically).    Unlike patents, plant varieties, designs and trade marks, there is no registration regime for copyright works in most of the jurisdictions including Hong Kong.

## Performer's economic rights

13. 'Performer's economic right' is defined to mean:
2. (a) a right mentioned in section 215(1)(a), (b), (c) or (d) of the CO and conferred by Part III of that Ordinance on a performer; or
3. (b) a right that corresponds to the right mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) and subsists under the law of a place outside Hong Kong.
14. According to section 200(2) of the CO, 'performance' means:
5. (a) a dramatic performance (which includes dance and mime);
6. (b) a musical performance;
7. (c) a reading or recitation of a literary work;
8. (d) a performance of an artistic work;
9. (e) an expression of folklore; or
10. (f) a performance of a variety act or any similar presentation,

which  is,  or  so  far  as  it  is,  an  unfixed  performance  given  by  one  or  more individuals.

15. Section 200(2) of the CO further defines 'performer' to mean an actor, singer, musician, dancer or any other person who acts, sings, delivers, declaims, plays in, interprets, or otherwise performs a performance.

16. A performer's rights in his performance are independent of:
2. (a) any  copyright  in,  or moral  rights  relating  to,  any  work performed or any film or sound recording of, or broadcast or cable programme including, the performance; and
3. (b) any other right or obligation arising otherwise than under Part III of the CO.
17. Performers are recognized for the pivotal role they play in the creative process in presentations to the public.    The CO confers rights on performers which enable them to prohibit the exploitation of their performances without their  consent. The  following  rights  conferred  under  section  215(1)  on  a performer are performer's economic rights:
5. (a) the right of reproduction;
6. (b) the right of distribution;
7. (c) the right of making available to the public; and
8. (d) the rental right.

These  property  rights  are  assignable. Similar  to  copyrights,  performer's economic rights are automatic rights which arise when the performance is given and registration is not required.

## Protected layout-design (topography) right s

18. 'Protected layout-design (topography) right' is defined to mean:
2. (a) a right in a layout-design (topography) that is protected under section  3  of  the  Layout-design  (Topography)  of  Integrated Circuits Ordinance (Cap. 445); or
3. (b) a right that corresponds to the right mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) and subsists under the law of a place outside Hong Kong.

19. Layout-design  (topography)  is  defined  in  section  2  of  the  Layoutdesign (Topography) of Integrated Circuits Ordinance to mean the 3-dimensional disposition, however expressed, of the elements of an integrated circuit (at least one of which is an active element) and of some or all of the interconnections of an  integrated  circuit,  or  such  a  3-dimensional  disposition  prepared  for  an integrated circuit intended for manufacture.
20. Rights in layout-design (topography) subsist immediately when the layout-design  (topography)  is  created. The  protection  is  automatic  and registration is not required.    However, to enjoy the protection, a layout-design (topography) must be original, and recorded in documentary form or incorporated  into  an  integrated  circuit.    A  qualified  owner  has  the  right  to reproduce or commercially exploit his protected layout-design (topography).

## Protected plant variety rights

21. 'Protected plant variety right' is defined to mean:
2. (a) a right granted under Part III of the Plant Varieties Protection Ordinance (Cap. 490); or
3. (b) a right that corresponds to the right mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) and subsists under the law of a place outside Hong Kong.
22. Plant variety rights are rights granted to plant breeders (or owners of the  variety)  over  cultivated  plant  varieties  they  have  bred  or  discovered  and developed.    The Plant Varieties Protection Ordinance provides owners of plant varieties with the legal means to apply for proprietary rights over plant varieties they have bred or discovered and developed.    A grantee of plant variety right has the exclusive right to produce for sale, to offer for sale or sell and to import or export reproductive material of the protected variety, to propagate the variety for commercial production of fruit or flowers and to license others to carry out any of the above activities.
23. The Plant Varieties Protection Ordinance covers all types of plants (e.g. food crops, vegetables, ornamentals) except inedible algae and inedible fungi. To be eligible for protection, the plant variety needs to be new, distinct, stable and homogenous.

## Registered designs

24. 'Registered  design'  is  defined  to  mean  a  design  registered  under section 25 of the Registered Designs Ordinance (Cap. 522) or under the law of any  place  outside  Hong  Kong.    Under  the  Registered  Designs  Ordinance,  a 'design' means features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament applied to an article by any industrial process, being features which in the finished article appeal to and are judged by the eye.    Designs registered under the Registered Designs Ordinance enjoy the protection afforded by that Ordinance in Hong Kong.

## Registered trade marks

25. 'Registered trade mark' is defined to mean a trade mark registered under section 47 of the Trade Marks Ordinance (Cap. 559) or under the law of any  place  outside  Hong  Kong.    Under  the  Trade  Marks  Ordinance,  a  'trade mark' means any sign which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings and which is capable of being represented graphically.    A trade mark may consist of words (including personal  names),  indications,  designs,  letters,  characters,  numerals,  figurative elements, colours, sounds, smells, the shape of goods or their packaging and any combination of such signs.    A trade  mark serves as  a badge of trade origin. Registration  for  trade  marks  provides  legal  protection  in  the  jurisdictions  or territories where they are registered.    Trade marks are registered for use in one or more specific classes of goods and services.

Sections  16E(1A)  and  16EA(11)  provide  that  capital  expenditures incurred  on  the  purchase  of  patent  rights,  rights  to  know-how  and  SIPRs including  legal  expenses  and  valuation  fees  incurred  in  connection  with  the purchase,  are  deductible.    However,  no  deduction  will  be  granted  for  any expenditure which is allowable as a deduction under Part 4 of the Ordinance. Under section  16(1)(g),  capital  expenditure  relating  to  registration  of  a  trade mark or design, or the registration or grant of a patent or plant variety right is specifically allowed for deduction.
27. For any patent right, right to know-how or SIPR generated from the research and development (R&amp;D) activities of a person, no deduction will be

allowable to the person under section 16E or 16EA because such patent right, right to know-how or SIPR was not purchased by the person.    If a project for the  development  of  the  intellectual  property  can  be  identified,  the  capital expenditure incurred on such a project may qualify for 100% tax deduction or enhanced tax deduction under section 16B of the Ordinance as R&amp;D expenditure. For  details,  refer  to  DIPN  No.  55 Deduction  for  Research  and  Development Expenditure .

## Example 1

Company-HK purchased a patent registered in the United States at a consideration  of  $1,000,000.    To  enjoy  protection  in  Hong  Kong, Company HK applied for registering the US patent in Hong Kong at a cost of $50,000.    Subsequently, Company-HK spent $2,000,000 on an R&amp;D project in Hong Kong by using that US patent.    A new patent was  generated  by  the  project  and  the  relevant  registration  cost  in Hong Kong was $100,000.

The capital expenditure of $1,000,000 incurred on the purchase of the US patent would be deductible under section 16E if it was used for the production  of  chargeable  profits.    However,  no  deduction  under section 16E would be allowed for the new patent that was patented in Hong Kong because the patent was not purchased by Company-HK. The  R&amp;D expenditure  of  $2,000,000  in  relation  to  the  new  patent might be deductible under section 16B if the prescribed conditions were fulfilled.    The costs of registration, $50,000 and $100,000, in Hong Kong of the US patent and the new patent would be deductible under section 16(1)(g) if the two patents were used for the production of chargeable profits.

## TIMING OF DEDUCTION

## One-off deduction in the year of purchase

28. For patent rights or rights to know-how, a full deduction is allowable under section 16E(1) for the year of assessment in the basis period for which the expenditure is incurred.    There is no requirement that the patent right or right to know-how, once acquired, must be used in the production of chargeable profits

in the year of purchase.    It is sufficient that at the time of purchase the purpose of  acquiring  the  patent  right  or  right  to  know-how  was  for  use  in  the  trade, profession or business carried on in Hong Kong.    However, withdrawal of the deduction may have to be considered if the subsequent facts prove otherwise.

## Deduction over 5 years or remaining period of protection

29. For  SIPRs,  section  16EA(3)  provides  that  deduction  of  the  capital expenditure is to be allowed by 5 equal amounts over 5 consecutive years starting from the year of assessment in the basis period for which the capital expenditure is incurred (i.e. year of purchase).    The deduction is, however, subject to section 16EA(6)(a) which provides that a deduction is allowable to a person only if the purchased  SIPR  has  been  used  in  the  trade,  profession  or  business  in  the production of the person's chargeable profits during a part or the whole of the basis period for a year of assessment for which an amount is deducted.    For example, if a purchased registered trade mark is put to use in the 4th year, deduction cannot be claimed for the amount of capital expenditure spread over for the years before the 4th year.    Only the amount of capital expenditure spread over for the 4th year  and  the  5th  year  would  be  allowable  provided  that  all  the  prescribed conditions for deduction are fulfilled.    In the extreme case where a purchased SIPR is not used until 5 years after its purchase, no deduction will be granted.
30. If the SIPR reaches the end of its finite life within the prescribed 5year spread-over period, the deduction is to be spread under section 16EA(4) over the years of assessment from the year of purchase to the year in which the right expires in equal amounts.

## Example 2

Company-HK purchased a copyright at a consideration of $400,000 during  the  basis  period  for  the  year  of  assessment  2019/20.    The maximum period of protection for which the copyright could subsist was due to expire during the basis period for the year of assessment 2022/23.

The deductible amount would be allowed by 4 equal amounts (i.e. $400,000 ÷ 4  =  $100,000)  for  each  of  the  4  years  of  assessment 2019/20 to 2022/23 if the other deduction criteria were fulfilled for each of the years of assessment concerned.

## Example 3

Facts  are  the  same  as  Example  2  but  the  maximum  period  of protection  for  which  the  copyright  could  subsist  was  due  to  expire during the basis period for the year of assessment 2019/20 (i.e. the year of purchase).

The consideration of $400,000 for the purchase of the copyright would be  fully  deductible  in  the  year  of  assessment  2019/20  if  the  other conditions for deduction were fulfilled.

## Maximum period of protection

## Copyrights

31. In the case of a copyright, the maximum period of protection means the maximum period for which the copyright may subsist under the CO or may subsist under the law of a place outside Hong Kong.
32. Sections 17 to 21 of the CO provide for the duration of copyright as follows:
3. (a) copyright in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work expires:
4. (i) in  the  case  with  known  authorship,  at  the  end  of  the period of 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the author dies; or
5. (ii) in the case with unknown authorship, at the end of the period of 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the work was first made; or if during that period the work is made available to the public, 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which it is first so made available;
6. (b) copyright in a sound recording expires at the end of the period of 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which it is made; or if during that period it is released, 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which it is released;

- (c) copyright in a film expires at the end of the period of 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the death occurs of the last to die of the following persons:
- (i) the principal director;
- (ii) the author of the screenplay;
- (iii) the author of the dialogue; or
- (iv) the composer of music specially created for and used in the film;
- (d) copyright in a broadcast or cable programme expires at the end of the period of 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the broadcast was made or the programme was included in a cable programme service; and
- (e) copyright in a typographical arrangement of a published edition expires at the end of the period of 25 years from the end of the calendar year in which the edition was first published.

## Performer's economic rights

33. In the case of a performer's economic right, the maximum period of protection  means  the  maximum  period  for  which  the  right  may  be  conferred under  the  CO  or  may  subsist  under  the  law  of  a  place  outside  Hong  Kong. According to section 214 of the CO, right in a performance expires at the end of the period of 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the performance takes place; or if during that period a fixation of the performance is released, 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the fixation is released.

## Protected layout-design (topography) rights

34. In  the  case  of  a  protected  layout-design  (topography)  right,  the maximum period of protection means the maximum period for which the layoutdesign may be protected under the Layout-design (Topography) of Integrated Circuits Ordinance or may subsist under the law of a place outside Hong Kong.

35. According  to  section  6  of  the  Layout-design  (Topography)  of Integrated  Circuits  Ordinance,  if  a  layout-design  (topography)  has  not  been commercially exploited anywhere in the world, the term of the protection will end 15 years after the end of the year in which it was created.    On the other hand, if a layout-design (topography) has been commercially exploited anywhere in the world, the term of the protection will end 10 years after the end of the year in which it was first commercially exploited.

## Protected plant variety rights

36. In the case of a protected plant variety right, the maximum period of protection means the maximum period for which the grant of the right may be in force under the Plant Varieties Protection Ordinance or may subsist under the law  of  a  place  outside  Hong  Kong.    According  to  section  22  of  the  Plant Varieties Protection Ordinance, a grant under that Ordinance is in force for a term of 25 years in the case of trees and vines and of 20 years in other cases.

## Registered designs

37. In the case of a registered design, the maximum period of protection means the maximum period for which the design may be registered under the Registered Designs Ordinance or under the law of a place outside Hong Kong. According to section 28 of the Registered Designs Ordinance, the initial period of registration of a design is 5 years beginning on the filing date of the application for  registration  and  may  be  renewed  for  further  periods  of  5  years  each. However, the total period of registration of a design may not exceed 25 years.

## Registered trade marks

38. According to section 49 of the Trade Marks Ordinance, a trade mark shall be registered for a period of 10 years beginning on its date of registration and may be renewed for further periods of 10 years.    Unlike the other SIPRs, protection of a trade mark can be perpetual provided that registration is renewed every 10 years.

## Capital expenditure incurred prior to commencement of business

39. Where capital expenditure was incurred on the purchase of a patent right, right to know-how or an SIPR for the purposes of a trade, profession or

business which was about to commence, the expenditure is to be treated under section 16E(3A) or 16EA(10) as if it had been incurred on the first day on which the trade, profession or business is carried on.

## CONDITIONS FOR DEDUCTION

40. Paragraphs 41 to 56 below set out the conditions that must be satisfied to support a deduction claim in respect of a patent right, right to know-how or an SIPR.

## Registration requirement

Registration systems in place

41. Since  registration  systems  are  in  place  for  patents,  plant  varieties, designs and trade marks, a patent right or a plant variety right must have been granted while a design or trade mark must have been registered on the date of acquisition with the relevant authorities.    For rights to know-how, copyrights, performer's economic rights and protected layout-design (topography) rights, no registration requirement is required.

## Registration in Hong Kong or overseas

42. The scope of the tax deduction covers registrations in Hong Kong as well as overseas registrations.    So long as the registration was in force during a part or the whole of the basis period of a year of assessment, deduction of the capital expenditure incurred on purchase of the relevant right, design or mark will be allowed provided that the other prescribed conditions are fulfilled.

## Registration of assignment in process

43. For protection of interests, it is common to submit an application to the  relevant  registration  authorities  for  registering  the  related  assignment. Recognizing that the registration process in some jurisdictions may take some time to complete, the Commissioner will adopt a liberal approach in considering deduction while the registration process is still going on.    In this regard, the relevant right, design or mark undergoing the registration process would also be accepted for claiming deduction.    For a patent right, a protected plant variety

right,  a  registered  design  and  a  registered  trade  mark,  deduction  would  be allowed for the capital expenditure incurred on purchase on the conditions that:

- (a) the relevant right, design or mark has already been registered by the previous owner with the relevant authorities; and
- (b) the application for registering the relevant right, design or mark has been submitted under the name of the person claiming the deduction.
44. To summarize, when applying for deduction of capital expenditure incurred  on  the  purchase,  if  documentary  evidence  can  be  provided  to substantiate that all the conditions for deduction have been fulfilled, including that the registration of the relevant right, design or mark has been effective from a  date  not  later  than  the  day  of  purchase,  the  deduction  will  be  granted. However, if the application for change of ownership is not eventually approved by the relevant authority, the relevant right, design or mark will not be eligible for deduction.    The Assessor will make an assessment or additional assessment, as appropriate to withdraw any deduction previously allowed within the six-year time limit under section 60 of the Ordinance.

## Invalidation, revocation and surrender

45. When  the  registration  of  a  right,  design  or  mark  is  subsequently invalidated, revoked or surrendered, the right concerned will not be eligible for the  deduction  from  the  date  when  the  invalidation,  revocation  or  surrender becomes effective.    The  Assessor  will,  in  accordance  with  section  60  of  the Ordinance,  make  an  assessment  or  additional  assessment,  as  appropriate  to withdraw any deduction previously allowed.

## Ownership requirement

## Legal and economic ownership

46. If a deduction is to be allowed, the person claiming the deduction must possess both the legal and economic ownership (or proprietary interest) in the patent  right,  right  to  know-how  or  SIPR  that  the  person  has  purchased. Deduction would only be applicable to an outright purchase of a patent right, right to know-how or an SIPR and not to an upfront fee paid for acquiring the

right to use for a specified period.    In the generality of cases, where the use of a patent right, right to know-how or an SIPR is granted by the owner as licensor under a licensing arrangement, the person paying a royalty as licensee would not have acquired the legal ownership in the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR concerned.

47. It  is  put  beyond  doubt  in  sections  16E(9)  and  16EA(13)  of  the Ordinance that any expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a 'licence' of a patent right, right to know-how or an SIPR is not deductible.    In this regard, a 'licence' in relation to a patent right, right to know-how or an SIPR is defined in section 16EC(8) as:
2. (a) a licence (however described and whether general or limited) authorizing the licensee to use the patent right, right to knowhow or SIPR in the manner authorized by the licence; but
3. (b) does not include an agreement under which the ownership of the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR will or may be sold to  or  pass  to  the  licensee  unless,  in  the  opinion  of  the Commissioner, the right to purchase or obtain the ownership of the patent right,  right  to  know-how  or  SIPR  under  the agreement would reasonably be expected not to be exercised.
48. On the other hand, expenses relating to the licensing of patent right, right  to  know-how  or  SIPR  may  be  deducted  upon  satisfying  the  normal deduction rules under sections 16(1) and 17 of the Ordinance (i.e. the expenses are deductible if they are incurred in the production of chargeable profits of the taxpayer and that they are not capital in nature).

## Example 4

Company-HK obtained the right to use a patent from the owner by way  of  a  10-year  licence.    The  consideration  included  an  upfront payment  of  $1,000,000  for  the  grant  of  the  licence  and  an  annual licence fee of $100,000.

Since Company-HK did not acquire the legal ownership of the patent, it would not be entitled to a deduction under section 16E or 16EA for whatever payments made under the licensing arrangement.

Nevertheless, the annual licence fee of $100,000 which was revenue in nature would be deductible under the general deduction provisions of  section  16(1).    However,  the  upfront  payment  in  the  amount  of $1,000,000  which  was  capital  in  nature  would  be  prohibited  for deduction under section 17(1)(c).

## Partial ownership

49. A person having partial ownership of a patent right, right to know-how or  an  SIPR  is  also  eligible  to  claim  for  the  deduction.    Sections  16E(5)  and 16EA(12) provide that the purchase and sale of a patent right, right to know-how or an SIPR includes a reference to the purchase and sale of a share or interest in the  patent  right,  right  to  know-how  or  SIPR.    In  the  generality  of  cases,  a person's share or interest is proportionate to the capital expenditure incurred by the person.    For these cases, the deduction for a person is computed by reference to  the  amount  of  capital  expenditure  incurred  by  the  person  in  acquiring  the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR.

## Example 5

Company-HK1  and  Company-HK2  acquired  a  know-how  at  a consideration of $100,000.    Their respective shares in the know-how were 30% and 70% and their respective capital expenditures incurred were $30,000 and $70,000.

Deductions available to Company-HK1 and Company-HK2 would be $30,000 and $70,000 respectively.

50. In the case where a person acquires only a partial share of the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR from the original owner, the person will be granted for the amount of capital expenditure incurred for acquisition of such share in the ownership of the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR.    If it happens that a person has incurred expenditure that is excessive when comparing with the person's share or interest in the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR, the Assessor may substitute the true market value for the stated consideration, after considering all the relevant circumstances of the case.

## Use requirement

51. There  is  no  definition  of  the  word  'use'  under  the  Ordinance. According to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, the word 'use' means: 'the action  of  using  something;  the  fact  or  state  of  being  used;  application  or conversion to some purpose'.    In relation to patent rights, rights to know-how and SIPRs, the word 'use' has its ordinary meaning which encompasses their use in the operations, such as manufacturing or trading, or their licensing.
52. The Commissioner will, having regard to the nature and the relevant facts of individual cases, determine whether the patent rights, rights to knowhow or SIPRs have been used for production of chargeable profits.    If it can be proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that concrete steps have been carried out in relation to the use of the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR for production of chargeable profits, the person claiming the deduction will be accepted as having fulfilled the requirement.

## Production of chargeable profits requirement

53. To be eligible for deduction, the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR has to be used in producing the chargeable profits of the person claiming the deduction.    Whether the patent, right to know-how or SIPR is used in the production of chargeable profits is a matter of fact and evidence.

## Example 6

A design registered in 10 jurisdictions was used in 4 jurisdictions and deduction of the expenditure of purchasing the design was claimed in respect  of  all  the  jurisdictions  on  the  ground  that  the  purpose  of purchasing the design registered in the remaining 6 jurisdictions was to protect the registration of the design in the 4 jurisdictions where it was used.

The  Commissioner would accept the  claim  only  if  substantive  and reasonable  evidence  can  be  provided  to  prove  that  the  design registered in the remaining 6 jurisdictions had direct and actual impact on the production of profits chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.

## Summary of deduction criteria

Patent rights and rights to know-how

54. According  to  section  16E  of  the  Ordinance,  where  a  person  has incurred capital expenditure on the purchase of a patent right or right to knowhow during the basis period for a year of assessment, subject to the exclusion provisions as discussed in paragraphs 70 to 87 below, deduction of the capital expenditure is allowable to the person for the year of assessment if:
2. (a) the registration or grant of the patent right is in force or the right to know-how subsists at the time of the purchase;
3. (b) upon  the  purchase,  the  person  has  possessed  the  legal  and economic ownership of the patent right or right to know-how; and
4. (c) the patent right or right to know-how is purchased for use in the production of the person's profits chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.

Specified intellectual property rights

55. According  to  section  16EA  of  the  Ordinance,  where  a  person  has incurred capital expenditure on the purchase of an SIPR during the basis period for  a  year  of  assessment  (i.e.  year  of  purchase),  subject  to  the  exclusion provisions as discussed in paragraphs 70 to 87 below, deduction of the capital expenditure  is  allowable  to  the  person  over  5  consecutive  years  (or  over  the remaining  period  of  protection  where  appropriate,  see  paragraphs  29  and  30 above) starting from the year of purchase if:
2. (a) the copyright subsists, the registration or grant of the registered design, registered trade mark or protected plant variety right is in force, the performer's economic right has not expired, or the protection of the layout-design (topography) has not ceased at the time of purchase and during a part or the whole of the basis period for the year of assessment;
3. (b) upon  the  purchase,  the  person  has  possessed  the  legal  and economic ownership of the SIPR;

- (c) at the end of the basis period for the year of assessment, the person has not sold the SIPR; and
- (d) the SIPR has been used in the production of the person's profits chargeable to tax in Hong Kong during a part or the whole of the basis period for the year of assessment.
56. As deduction of the capital expenditure on SIPRs will be spread over 5  years  or  over  the  remaining  period  of  protection,  each  of  the  years  of assessment  concerned  will  be  considered  separately  and  the  conditions  in paragraph 55 above will need to be satisfied for each of the years of assessment concerned.

## Example 7

Company-HK purchased a design registered in Jurisdiction-F which was  used  on  products  sold  in  Jurisdiction-F. The  profits  were chargeable  to  profits  tax  in  Hong  Kong.    The  registration  of  the design in Jurisdiction-F was in force and Company-HK did not sell the registered design during the relevant years of assessment.

Company-HK was eligible to claim deduction for the purchase cost of the registered design incurred in the year of purchase (over 5 years of assessment) because: (a) the design was registered in Jurisdiction-F and was in force where it was used; (b) Company-HK possessed the legal and economic ownership of the registered design and had not sold the registered design at the end of the basis period; and (c) the registered design was used for production of Company-HK's profits chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.

## Example 8

Company-HK purchased in the year of assessment 2017/18 from a US company a trade mark at a total consideration of $1,000,000 which had  been  registered  in  Hong  Kong  and  the  US.    The  Hong  Kong registered trade mark and US registered trade mark were valued at $600,000 and $400,000 respectively.    In the year of purchase (i.e. year of assessment 2017/18), sale of the branded goods was made to Hong Kong customers only.    In the following year (i.e. year of assessment

2018/19), Company-HK set up a branch office in the US for sale of the branded  goods  to  US  customers.    The  profits  derived  by  the  US branch office were chargeable to Hong Kong profits tax.

In the year of assessment 2017/18, since the Hong Kong registered trade mark was wholly used for sale of the branded goods in Hong Kong, the deduction allowable would be $120,000 (i.e. $600,000 ÷ 5). No deduction for the US registered trade mark was allowed as it had not been used at all.

In  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19,  Company-HK  used  the  US registered trade mark for the production of chargeable profits.    The deduction allowable in respect of the US registered trade mark would be  $80,000  (i.e.  $400,000  ÷  5). In  respect  of  the  Hong  Kong registered trade mark, the deductible amount would be the same as in the  year  of  assessment  2017/18  (i.e.  $120,000).    Hence,  the  total allowable deduction in the year of assessment 2018/19 is $200,000 (i.e. $120,000 + $80,000).

## DETERMINATION OF TRUE MARKET VALUE

## Commissioner's power to determine the true market value

57. For the proper computation of the deduction allowable, it is essential that the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR purchased is correctly valued. In the normal course of event, it is the duty of the person who wishes to claim a deduction of the capital expenditure on a patent right, right to know-how or an SIPR to state the same in the person's tax return.    The person is not required to attach the valuation report when filing the tax return.    However, for the purpose of ascertaining the person's correct tax liability, the Assessor may, as it deems necessary, request the person to provide documentary proof such as valuation report, if available, to substantiate the claim.    The Commissioner is empowered under sections 16E(8) and 16EA(9) to determine the 'true market price' for any sale or purchase of any patent right, right to know-how or SIPR if he is of the opinion that the consideration does not represent the true market value of that patent right, right to know-how or SIPR at the time of that purchase or sale.

58. As the term 'true market value' is not defined in the Ordinance, the Commissioner has to resort to its ordinary meaning.    In general, it means the price at which a willing buyer and a willing seller would transact, with each party having  access  to  all  relevant  information  and  with  neither  party  under  the compulsion to transact.    This is in line with the Australian High Court decision in Spencer v The Commonwealth of Australia (1907) 5 CLR 418, in which the following principles were recognized:
2. (a) existence of a willing but not anxious seller and purchaser;
3. (b) existence of a hypothetical market (i.e. if there is no market for the asset being valued, the valuer is to assume a market);
4. (c) the parties being fully informed  of the advantages and disadvantages associated with the asset being valued; and
5. (d) both parties being aware of current market conditions.

## Valuation reports

59. The valuation report provided by the person claiming the deduction is the starting point for the Commissioner to determine the true market value.    For warranted cases, the Commissioner may seek separate valuation from independent professional valuers on the 'true market value' of the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR concerned.

## Purchased or sold together with other assets for a single price

60. Where a patent right, right to know-how or an SIPR is purchased or sold  together  with  other  assets  for  a  single  price,  the  Commissioner  under sections 16E(7) and 16EA(8) is empowered to allocate a price for the purchase or sale of the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR having regard to all the circumstances of the transaction.

## Rights of objection and appeal

61. If a person disagrees with the Commissioner's valuation or allocation of consideration in respect of a patent right, right to know-how or an SIPR, the person  can  object  to  the  profits  tax  assessment  in  which  the  valuation  or

allocation is adjusted.    The objection will be processed in accordance with the relevant provisions under Part 11 of the Ordinance.

## APPORTIONMENT OF RELATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

## Partly used in the production of chargeable profits

62. If a patent right, right to know-how or an SIPR is purchased for use partly in the production of chargeable profits and partly for any other purposes, the deduction allowable under sections 16E(2) and 16EA(7) shall be that part of the capital expenditure that is proportionate to the extent of the use of the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR in the production of the chargeable profits.

## Example 9

Company-HK purchased a trade mark which was affixed to goods for sale  to  Hong  Kong  customers.    At  the  same  time,  Company-HK granted the use of that trade mark to its fellow subsidiary in Hong Kong for free.

The  trade  mark  was  only  partly  used  by  Company-HK  in  the production  of  chargeable  profits. An  adjustment  for  the  nonallowable portion should be made and the appropriate apportionment to be decided would depend on the particular circumstances of the case.

## Basis of apportionment

63. In making an apportionment, the objective is to find a basis which is reasonable and appropriate in the particular circumstances of the case, including the terms of the agreement relating to the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR, the manner and the use to which it is put, the range and scope of the activities both within and outside Hong Kong and whether the whole of the profit is subject to tax in Hong Kong.    It is not possible to lay down any hard and fast rule and it will be for the person claiming the deduction to justify his claim and the basis of apportionment adopted.

## SUBSEQUENT DISPOSAL

## Deemed trading receipts from subsequent sale

64. Section 16E(3) of the Ordinance provides that where a patent right or right to know-how in respect of which a deduction has been allowed is sold, the relevant  proceeds  of  sale,  not  otherwise  chargeable  to  profits  tax  and  not exceeding  the  amount  of  deduction  previously  allowed,  will  be  treated  as  a trading receipt arising in or derived from Hong Kong.
65. Section 16EB(2) provides that where an SIPR in respect of which a deduction has been allowed is sold:
3. (a) if  the  unallowed  amount  of  the  SIPR  exceeds  the  relevant proceeds of sale, the excess will be deducted for the year of assessment in the basis period for which the sale occurs; or
4. (b) if the relevant proceeds of sale exceed the unallowed amount of the SIPR, or if there is not an unallowed amount, the excess or  the  relevant  proceeds  of  sale,  as  the  case  may  be,  not otherwise  chargeable  to  profits  tax  and  not  exceeding  the amount of deduction previously allowed, will be treated as a trading receipt arising in or derived from Hong Kong.
66. The deemed trading receipt mentioned in paragraphs 64 and 65(b) will be treated as accruing at the time of the sale.    If the sale occurs on or after the date  on  which  the  business  is  permanently  discontinued,  the  deemed  trading receipt  will  be  treated  as  accruing  immediately  before  the  discontinuance according to sections 16E(3) and 16EB(2).

## Relevant proceeds of sale

67. The term 'relevant proceeds of sale', in relation to any patent right, right to know-how or SIPR in respect of which a deduction has been allowed, is defined in section 16E(4) or 16EB(3) to mean:
2. (a) if the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR is used wholly in the production of chargeable profits, the proceeds of sale of the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR; or

- (b) if the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR is used partly in the production of chargeable profits, such part of the proceeds of  sale  of  the  patent  right,  right  to  know-how  or  SIPR  as  is proportionate  to  the  extent  to  which  the  deduction  has  been allowed.
68. Where only part of the cost of such patent right, right to know-how or SIPR has been allowed, only that part of the proceeds as is attributable to the relevant cost of the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR will be assessed as a trading receipt.    The basis of apportionment of the sale price will depend on the facts of each case.

## Example 10

Company-HK purchased a patent at a cost of $500,000 during the basis  period  for  the  year  of  assessment  2017/18.    The  patent  was used partly in the production of chargeable profits and the allowable proportion was 50%.    Company-HK subsequently sold the patent for $200,000 during the basis period for the year of assessment 2018/19.

Patent cost of $250,000 (i.e. $500,000 × 50%) would be allowed for deduction  for  the  year  of  assessment  2017/18.    Since  the  relevant proceeds of sale in the amount of $100,000 (i.e. $200,000 × 50%) did not  exceed  the  deduction  previously  allowed  (i.e.  $250,000),  such proceeds  would  be  deemed  as  a  trading  receipt  for  the  year  of assessment 2018/19.

## Unallowed amount

69. The term 'unallowed amount', in relation to an SIPR in respect of which a deduction has been allowed and which is subsequently sold, is defined in section 16EB(3) to mean:
2. (a) if  the  SIPR  is  used  wholly  in  the  production  of  chargeable profits, the amount of specified capital expenditure incurred in relation to the SIPR that is still unallowed as at the time of the sale; or
3. (b) if the SIPR is used partly in the production of chargeable profits,

such part of the amount referred to in sub-paragraph (a) above as is proportionate to the extent to which the deduction has been allowed.

## Example 11

Company-HK  purchased  a  registered  trade  mark  for  $2,000,000 during  the  basis  period  for  the  year  of  assessment  2016/17.    The registered trade mark was used partly in the production of chargeable profits and the allowable proportion was 50% and 60% for the years of assessment 2016/17 and 2017/18 respectively.    During the basis period  for  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19,  Company-HK  sold  the registered trade mark for $3,000,000.

Purchase cost of $2,000,000 would be allowed for deduction and spread over in equal amounts of $400,000 (i.e. $2,000,000 ÷ 5) for five consecutive years of assessment starting from 2016/17 and up to 2020/21.

## Years of assessment 2016/17 and 2017/18

Allowable  deduction  was  proportionate  to  the  extent  of  use  of  the registered trade mark in the production of chargeable profits:

| Year of assessment   | Purchase cost to be spread over the 5-year deduction period   | Percentage of use   | Allowable deduction   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
|                      | [1]                                                           | [2]                 | [3] = [1] × [2]       |
| 2016/17              | $400,000                                                      | 50%                 | $200,000              |
| 2017/18              | $400,000                                                      | 60%                 | $240,000              |
| Total                | $800,000                                                      | 55%                 | $440,000              |

The total allowable deduction for the first two years was $440,000. The extent to which deduction was allowed for the first two years was 55% (i.e. $440,000 ÷ $800,000).

## Year of assessment 2018/19

Since 55% of the registered trade mark was used in the production of chargeable profits, 55% of the sale proceeds of $3,000,000 would be taken  as  the  relevant  proceeds  of  sale. Similarly,  55%  of  the purchase cost still unallowed (i.e. $2,000,000 -$800,000) would be taken as the unallowed amount.

|                                                                                           | $         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Relevant proceeds of sale ($3,000,000 × 55%)                                              | 1,650,000 |
| Unallowed amount ($2,000,000 - $800,000) × 55%                                            | (660,000) |
| Excess amount                                                                             | 990,000   |
| Deemed trading receipt restricted to the amount previously allowed per section 16EB(2)(b) | 440,000   |

As  the  relevant  proceeds  of  sale  (i.e.  $1,650,000)  exceeded  the unallowed amount (i.e. $660,000), the excess, to the extent that did not exceed the amount of deduction previously allowed (i.e. $440,000), would be treated as Company-HK's trading receipts accruing in the year of assessment 2018/19.

## Example 12

The facts are the same as Example 11 except that the trade mark was sold for $1,000,000.

## Year of assessment 2018/19

The  unallowed  amount  was  $660,000  and  the  amount  of  relevant proceeds of sale was $550,000 (i.e. $1,000,000 × 55%).

|                                                | $         |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Relevant proceeds of sale ($1,000,000 × 55%)   | 550,000   |
| Unallowed amount ($2,000,000 - $800,000) × 55% | (660,000) |
| Allowable deduction per section 16EB(2)(a)     | 110,000   |

As the unallowed amount (i.e. $660,000) was greater than the relevant proceeds  of  sale  (i.e.  $550,000),  the  excess  of  $110,000  would  be deductible for the year of assessment 2018/19.

## DEDUCTION NOT ALLOWED UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

70. Section 16EC provides for non-deduction of expenditure in various circumstances and applies to patent rights, rights to any know-how as well as SIPRs.

## Purchase with early termination of licence (transitional provision)

71. Section 16EC(1) provides that no deduction is allowable in respect of any SIPR purchased by a person if:
2. (a) at any time before the respective commencement date (i.e. 16 December 2011 (in relation to a copyright, registered design or registered  trade  mark);  or  29  June  2018  (in  relation  to  a performer's economic right, protected layout-design (topography) right or protected plant variety right)), the SIPR had been used by the person under a licence the expiry date of which fell on or after the respective commencement date;
3. (b) the licence was terminated before that expiry date; and
4. (c) the Commissioner is of the opinion that, having regard to the early  termination  of  the  licence,  the  consideration  for  the purchase is not reasonable consideration in the circumstances of the case.
72. This provision aims to prevent the licensor and the licensee of an SIPR from abusing the deduction by turning the licensing arrangement into a sale and purchase arrangement with an unreasonably 'low' purchase consideration which may be bundled with an option to buy back the SIPR on a later day.    By doing so, the licensor would enjoy the benefits of turning the chargeable profits (i.e. the  original  royalties)  into  non-taxable  capital  receipts,  whereas  the  licensee enjoys the benefit of accelerated deduction (5-year straight-line deduction vis-avis annual deduction over the whole licensing period).
73. The Commissioner takes the view that termination of the licence of an SIPR for the purposes of section 16EC(1) includes termination by an implied agreement between the parties or by operation of law.    Nevertheless, this antiavoidance measure would not be applicable to a genuine transaction where the

purchase price of an SIPR is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, a reasonable consideration  for  acquiring  the  proprietary  interest  of  the  SIPR. Factors influencing the Commissioner's decision include:

- (a) reasons  for  entering  into  such  a  transaction  between  the licensee and the licensor;
- (b) the terms and conditions agreed between the parties concerned;
- (c) the basis of computation for the purchase price of the SIPR; and
- (d) whether there is an option for the original owner to buy back the SIPR.
74. Section 16EC(1) is a transitional measure.    It would not be applicable to  a  person  who  became  a  licensee  of  an  SIPR  on  or  after  the  respective commencement date (i.e. 16 December 2011 or 29 June 2018, as the case may be) and purchased the same SIPR before the expiry date of the relevant licence. At the time when the person entered into the licensing arrangement, the person already had the option to enjoy the deduction if the person chose to purchase the proprietary  interest  of  the  SIPR.    Hence,  the  Commissioner  would  normally regard  that  the  person  did  not  have  a  strong  motive  to  turn  the  licensing arrangement into a sale and purchase arrangement for tax purposes before the expiry date of the relevant licence.

## Purchase from associates

75. By virtue of section 16EC(2), no deduction is allowable if the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR is purchased wholly or partly from an associate, irrespective of whether or not the price is at an arm's-length.    The meaning of 'associate' is widely defined under section 16EC(8) to cover natural persons, partners in a partnership, or corporations under common control and trusts.
76. In the case of a trust, the purchase or sale of a patent right, right to know-how or an SIPR by the trustee of the trust estate or a corporation controlled by the trustee would be regarded under section 16EC(3) as the purchase or sale, as the case may be, by each of the trustee, the corporation and the beneficiary under the trust.

## Sale and license back arrangement

77. Under section 16EC(4)(a), deduction would not be allowed in respect of any patent right, right to know-how or SIPR purchased under a sale and license back arrangement.    The denial of deduction is intended to prevent an overall tax benefit being obtained through this kind of tax avoidance schemes.
78. In  general,  section  16EC(4)(a)  denies  deduction  for  the  capital expenditure incurred on the purchase of a patent right, right to know-how or an SIPR by a person (i.e. the licensor or owner) if:
3. (a) at any time when the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR is owned by the person, another person (i.e. the licensee) holds rights as a licensee under a licence (see definition in paragraph 47) of the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR; and
4. (b) the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR was, before it was purchased by the person, owned and used by the 'end-user' who is either:
5. (i) the licensee, whether alone or with others; or
6. (ii) an 'associate' of the licensee.

For this purpose, the term 'associate' has been defined widely in section 16EC(8) in order to prevent circumvention of the provisions by the interposition of third parties.

79. Section 16EC(5) is a carve-out provision excluding genuine commercial financing arrangements from the anti-avoidance provisions.    This exception applies in the situation where:
2. (a) the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR was purchased by the  person  from  the  end-user  at  a  price  not  more  than  the purchase price paid by the end-user to the supplier as required by section 16EC(5)(a);
3. (b) the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR was purchased by the  end-user  from  the  supplier  on  or  after  the  respective

commencement date (i.e. 16 December 2011 (in relation to a patent right, right to know-know, copyright, registered design or  registered  trade  mark);  or  29  June  2018  (in  relation  to  a performer's economic right, protected layout-design (topography) right or protected plant variety right)) as required by section 16EC(5)(b); and

- (c) no deduction in respect of the purchase cost of the patent right, right  to  know-how  or  SIPR  has  been  made  to  the  end-user before the purchase of the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR by the taxpayer as required by section 16EC(5)(c).

This exception is added so that a person, who has a need to purchase a new patent right, right to know-how or SIPR, can still obtain finance through sale and license back  arrangements,  without  being  hindered  by  the  anti-avoidance  provisions. The carve-out provision is not applicable to any patent right, right to know-how or SIPR purchased by the end-user before the respective commencement date.

## Example 13

On 1 June 2017, Company-HK1 purchased a performer's economic right  and  immediately  put  it  into  business  use.    On  1  July  2018, Company-HK1 sold the performer's economic right to Company-HK2 which in turn licensed it back to Company-HK1 for royalties.

Company-HK2 would be denied deduction in respect of the purchase of the performer's economic right under section 16EC(4)(a) because the  performer's  economic  right  was,  before  it  was  purchased  by Company-HK2, owned and used by Company-HK1.    The exception in section 16EC(5) did not apply because Company-HK1 purchased the performer's economic right before 29 June 2018 and the condition under section 16EC(5)(b) was not fulfilled.

## Example 14

On 1 June 2017, Company-HK1 purchased a copyright at a cost of $1,000,000  for  its  business  use.    Shortly  after  the  purchase  and without claiming any deduction in respect of the purchase cost of the copyright, Company-HK1 sold the copyright to Company-HK2 at the

same price and in turn, Company-HK2 licensed the copyright back to Company-HK1 for an annual fee of $110,000 for a period of 10 years. Under  the  licensing  agreement,  Company-HK1  had  no  right  to purchase or obtain ownership of the copyright.

The conditions in section 16EC(5) would be satisfied and CompanyHK2 would not be denied deduction.    Company-HK1 in effect made use of the sale and license back arrangement to obtain the right to use the  copyright  without  initial  capital  outlay.    Company-HK2,  the licensor, had in effect committed capital into the copyright, incurring genuine  commercial  risk.    The  whole  arrangement  was  a  normal commercial transaction.

80. Since  entitlement  to  deduction  is  automatic  upon  purchase  of  the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR, in order for the exception in paragraph 79 above to apply, it will be necessary for the end-user to submit a disclaimer to the Commissioner in writing within 3 months from the date on which the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR was acquired, or within such further period as the Commissioner may permit.    Generally, the Commissioner will not entertain requests  for  an  extension  of  the  3-month  disclaimer  period. A  notice  of disclaimer should be accompanied by the following information:
2. (a) a description of the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR;
3. (b) the name and address of the seller (or preceding seller);
4. (c) the  date  of  purchase  from  and  price  paid  to  the  seller  (or preceding seller);
5. (d) the date of sale to and price paid by the licensor; and
6. (e) the name and address of the licensor.

The above information must be supported by copies of the purchase and sale agreements or invoices and the licence agreements.

81. After submitting a notice of disclaimer, the end-user might decide to retain the right to claim deduction and seek to cancel the sale and license back arrangement.    As  a  concession,  the  Commissioner  is  prepared  to  allow  the

withdrawal of a disclaimer, provided that the relevant assessment has not yet become final and conclusive.

## Used wholly or principally outside Hong Kong by other persons

82. Section  16EC(4)(b)  stipulates  that  no  deduction  is  allowable  under section 16E or 16EA in respect of any patent right, right to know-how or SIPR purchased by a person (i.e. the licensor or owner) if:
2. (a) at any time when the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR is  owned  by  the  person,  another  person  holds  rights  as  a licensee under a licence of the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR; and
3. (b) the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR is, while the licence is in force, used wholly or principally outside Hong Kong by a person other than the person who owns the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR.
83. Following similar principles behind section 39E of the Ordinance, the purpose of section 16EC(4)(b) is to deny tax deduction in respect of a patent right,  right  to  know-how  or  an  SIPR  which  is  used  outside  Hong  Kong  by  a person other than the owner for the production of profits not chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.

## Example 15

Company-HK  purchased  an  SIPR  and  allowed  its  overseas  subcontractor to use the SIPR  outside Hong  Kong  for  the  subcontractor's production activities at no cost.

Under section 16EC(4)(b), Company-HK would be denied deduction of the capital expenditure incurred on the purchase of the SIPR.    The profits derived from the overseas production activities were profits of the  sub-contractor,  not  profits  of  Company-HK. Based  on  the territorial source principle, the profits derived by the sub-contractor from the overseas production activities  were  sourced  outside  Hong Kong and would not be chargeable to Hong Kong profits tax.    In accordance with the tax symmetry principle, Company-HK should not

be granted deduction in respect of the SIPR since the royalty income, if any, could be sourced outside Hong Kong.

84. Taking into consideration of the peculiar nature of IPRs, the territorial registration system and protection of the rights and the wide scope in which the rights can be used, the Commissioner is prepared to adopt a pragmatic approach in applying the provisions.    The application of section 16EC(4)(b) is illustrated by the following examples.

## Example 16

Company-HK,  which  was  carrying  on  a  trading  business  in  Hong Kong, purchased a trade mark registered in Hong Kong at a cost of $1,000,000 during the basis period for the year of assessment 2018/19. The  trade  mark  was  not  registered  in  any  places  other  than  Hong Kong. Company-HK  contracted Company-F,  a manufacturer located in Jurisdiction-F, to produce goods bearing the Hong Kong registered trade mark.    The finished goods were sold by CompanyHK  to  customers  in  Hong  Kong  and  the  profits  derived  were chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.

Company-HK only purchased the Hong Kong registered trade mark and did not acquire any right to use the trade mark in places other than Hong Kong.    When manufacturing the goods in Jurisdiction-F, what Company-F used was an unregistered trade mark in Jurisdiction-F, not the  trade  mark  registered  in  Hong  Kong.    In  the  circumstances, section  16EC(4)(b)  would  not  be  applicable. Since  the  profits derived  by  Company-HK  from  selling  the  finished  goods  were chargeable to tax in  Hong Kong and provided that other deduction requirements were satisfied, Company-HK was entitled to deduct onefifth of the purchase cost of the Hong Kong registered trade mark (i.e. $200,000) for the year of assessment 2018/19.

## Example 17

Company-HK,  which  was  carrying  on  a  trading  business  in  Hong Kong, purchased a trade mark registered in Hong Kong at a cost of $2,000,000 during the basis period for the year of assessment 2018/19. The trade mark was not registered in places other than Hong Kong.

Company-HK  subsequently  registered  the same  trade mark  in Jurisdiction-F and contracted Company-F, a manufacturer in Jurisdiction-F, to produce in Jurisdiction-F goods bearing the trade mark.    The goods produced by Company-F were sold in Hong Kong by Company-HK and the profits derived were chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.

Company-HK only purchased the Hong Kong registered trade mark but  not  the  trade  mark  registered  in  Jurisdiction-F.    It  became  the registered  owner  of  the  trade  mark  in  Jurisdiction-F  because  it subsequently registered the trade mark in Jurisdiction-F.    The trade mark used by Company-F in the production of goods in JurisdictionF was the one registered in Jurisdiction-F by Company-HK and not the  Hong  Kong  registered  trade  mark  purchased  by  Company-HK. As  such,  section  16EC(4)(b)  would  not  be  applicable.    Since  the profits derived by Company-HK from selling the finished goods were chargeable to tax in Hong Kong and provided that the other deduction requirements  were  satisfied,  Company-HK  was  entitled  to  deduct one-fifth of the purchase cost of the Hong Kong registered trade mark (i.e. $400,000) for the year of assessment 2018/19.

## Example 18

During the basis period for the year of assessment 2018/19, CompanyHK,  which  was  carrying  on  a  trading  business  in  Hong  Kong, purchased a trade mark registered both in  Hong  Kong  and Jurisdiction-F at a cost of $3,000,000.    The Hong Kong registered trade mark and the Jurisdiction-F registered trade mark were each valued  at  $1,500,000. Company-HK  contracted  Company-F,  a contract  manufacturer  located  in  Jurisdiction-F,  to  produce  goods bearing  the  trade  mark.    All  of  the  finished  goods  were  sold  by Company-HK to customers in Hong Kong and the profits derived were chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.

Insofar as the trade mark registered in Hong Kong was concerned, it was  used  by  Company-HK  itself  for  selling  the  finished  goods  to produce profits chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.    Therefore, section 16EC(4)(b)  would  not  be  applicable.    For  the  year  of  assessment 2018/19,  Company-HK  was  entitled  to  deduct  one-fifth  of  the

purchase cost of the Hong Kong registered trade mark (i.e. $300,000).

As  for  the  Jurisdiction-F  registered  trade  mark,  it  was  used  by Company-F for production of goods in Jurisdiction-F.    As such, section 16EC(4)(b) would be applicable and the purchase price of $1,500,000 for the Jurisdiction-F registered trade mark would not be deductible.

## Example 19

Facts  are  the  same  as  Example  18.    However,  the  finished  goods were sold by Company-HK to customers in Hong Kong and the US. The profits so derived were chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.

Insofar as the trade mark registered in Hong Kong was concerned, it was  used  by  Company-HK  itself  for  selling  the  finished  goods  to produce  profits  chargeable  to  tax  in  Hong  Kong. In  addition, Company-HK when selling the goods in the US market was not using the trade mark registered in Hong Kong.    As such, section 16EC(4)(b) would  not  be  applicable. For  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19, Company-HK was entitled to deduct one-fifth of the purchase cost of the Hong Kong registered trade mark (i.e. $300,000).

As  for  the  Jurisdiction-F  registered  trade  mark,  it  was  used  by Company-F for production of goods in Jurisdiction-F.    As such, section 16EC(4)(b) would be applicable and the purchase price of $1,500,000 for the Jurisdiction-F registered trade mark was not deductible.

## Example 20

Facts are the same as Example 18 except Company-F manufactured 1,000,000  pieces  of  goods  during  the  basis  period  for  the  year  of assessment 2018/19.    However, the  goods  were sold by CompanyHK to  customers  in  Hong  Kong,  the  US  and  Jurisdiction-F  in  the respective quantities of 200,000, 200,000 and 600,000.    The profits so derived were all chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.

Insofar as the trade mark registered in Hong Kong was concerned, it was  used  by  Company-HK  itself  for  selling  the  finished  goods  to produce  profits  chargeable  to  tax  in  Hong  Kong. In  addition,

Company-HK  when  selling  the  goods  in  the  US  market  and  the Jurisdiction-F market was not using the trade mark registered in Hong Kong.    As such, section 16EC(4)(b) would not be applicable.    For the year of assessment 2018/19, Company-HK was entitled to deduct one-fifth of the purchase cost of the Hong Kong registered trade mark (i.e. $300,000).

As for the Jurisdiction-F registered trade mark, it was partly used by Company-F for production of goods in Jurisdiction-F and partly used by Company-HK  for selling some of the finished goods in Jurisdiction-F.    In the circumstances, section 16EC(4)(b) would be applicable to the part of the Jurisdiction-F registered trade mark that was used by Company-F in manufacturing activities in Jurisdiction-F. Nevertheless,  Company-HK  was  still  entitled  to  deduct  part  of purchase price of the Jurisdiction-F registered trade mark which was used by itself to sell the finished goods in Jurisdiction-F, producing profits chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.

In calculating the deductible amount,  one  possible method  of apportionment is the ratio of deductible activities (i.e. sales) to total activities (i.e. sales and manufacturing) in connection with the use of the  trade  mark.    The  amount  of  deduction  for  the  Jurisdiction-F registered trade mark would be calculated as follows:

| Purchase price of   | Purchase price of                    | Purchase price of   | Purchase price of   | No. of units sold in Jurisdiction-F                                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| the                 | Jurisdiction-F registered trade mark | ÷                   | 5 ×                 | No. of units manufactured in Jurisdiction-F and no. of units sold in Jurisdiction-F |
| =                   | $1,500,000                           | ÷                   | 5 ×                 | 1,600,000 (i.e. 1,000,000 + 600,000)                                                |

## Leveraged licensing arrangement

85. A  leveraged  licensing  arrangement  is  typically  one  in  which  a partnership of companies acquires a patent right, right to know-how or an SIPR which the partnership licenses for a fixed term, say 10 years, to a licensee and where, by reason of the 'leverage' obtained from the borrowing of a substantial non-recourse loan, the members of the partnership are effectively at risk for no more than a relatively small part of the funds used to acquire the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR.    The lenders' security for the substantial amounts lent to acquire the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR is limited to the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR itself and/or by way of a charge over the licence and the related licence fees or royalties.
86. So  far  as  it  relates  to  leveraged  licensing  arrangements,  section 16EC(4)(c) denies deduction for the capital expenditure incurred on the purchase of a patent right, right to know-how or an SIPR by a taxpayer (i.e. the licensor or owner) if:
3. (a) at any time when the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR is  owned  by  the  taxpayer,  another  person  holds  rights  as  a licensee under a licence of the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR; and
4. (b) the whole or a predominant part of the consideration for the purchase of the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR was financed directly or indirectly by a non-recourse debt.
87. The  term  'non-recourse  debt'  is  defined  extensively  in  section 16EC(8) but in broad terms means, as mentioned above, a method of financing where the borrower has no absolute liability in respect of the borrowing and in the event of default in repayment, the rights of the lender are restricted to the patent right, right to know-how or SIPR itself or the income generated by it.
