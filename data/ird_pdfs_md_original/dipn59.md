## INTRODUCTION

## Transfer pricing explained

A  transfer  price  is  the  price  charged  in  a  transaction  between  two associated persons. Rule  1 in  section  50AAF  of  the  Inland  Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112) (the IRO), enacted under the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 6) Ordinance 2018 (2018 Amendment (No. 6) Ordinance), concerns the prices charged in transactions between associated persons as, in such circumstances, the price charged may not necessarily be that which would have been charged if the persons had not been associated.    In this context, the term 'associated' means that the 'participation condition' in section 50AAG of the IRO is met.

2. While a transfer pricing risk mainly arises in cross-border transactions  between  associated  persons  who  are  part  of  a  multinational enterprise  (MNE)  group,  Rule  1  also  applies  to  domestic  transactions,  other than the transactions under which no potential advantage in relation to Hong Kong tax is taken to be conferred. Rule 1 is not limited to company-to-company transactions.    A  transaction  between  a  company  and  a controlling individual may be within the ambit of Rule 1.

## ARM'S LENGTH PRINCIPLE

## Arm's length principle explained

3. The member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  have  agreed  that  to  achieve  a  fair division of taxing profits and to address international double taxation, transactions between associated enterprises should be treated for tax purposes by  reference  to  the  amount  of  profits  that  would  have  arisen  if  the  same transactions had been undertaken by independent persons.    This is the arm's length principle.
4. For  a  variety  of  reasons,  the  business  arrangements  and  pricing policies under which MNE groups operate can result in conditions considerably different  from  those  which  would  have  been  seen  between  independent

enterprises engaged in the same or similar transactions.    The conditions which would be expected to be seen between independent enterprises are referred to as  being  at  'arm's  length'.    The  arm's  length  principle  is  applied  to  a transaction between associated enterprises (i.e. controlled transaction) by:

- (a) replacing  (hypothetically)  the  actual  conditions  (e.g.  price) under  which  the  transaction  was  done  with  the  arm's  length conditions; and
- (b) recalculating the profits or losses for tax purposes accordingly.
5. The arm's length principle is endorsed by the OECD and enshrined in  the  associated  enterprises  article  of  the OECD Model Tax  Convention  on Income and on Capital (the  MTC).    The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (the TPG) contains more details  about  the  arm's  length  principle  and  the  choice  and  application  of  the most appropriate transfer pricing methodology in any given case.
6. The complexities of applying the arm's length principle in practice should  not  be  underestimated.    Because  of  the  closeness  of  the  relationship between  the associated enterprises, there can be genuine difficulties in determining what arm's length conditions would have been.    This is especially true  where  it  is  not  possible  to  find  exact  comparable  transactions  between independent enterprises and there are many factors to take into account.

## Arm's length amount

7. It  is  possible  that  application  of  the  OECD's  guidelines  may  not produce a single condition, such as an exact price, but may produce a range of conditions  where  each  condition  constitutes  an  arm's  length  condition.    In these cases, differences in the figures that comprise the range may be caused by the  fact  that  in  general  the  application  of  the  arm's  length  principle  only produces  an  approximation  of  conditions  that  would  be  established  between independent enterprises.    It is also possible that the different points in a range represent the fact that independent enterprises engaged in comparable transactions  under  comparable  circumstances  may  not  establish  exactly  the same price for the transaction.

8. Transfer  pricing  is  not  an  exact  science.    There  will  be  many occasions  when  the  application  of  the  most  appropriate  method  or  methods produces a range of figures all of which are relatively equally reliable.    If the prices  set  by  the  parties  to  the  transaction  fall  within  the  arm's  length  range, there may not be any transfer pricing adjustment.

## ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES ARTICLE

## Importance of the associated enterprises article

9. The  general  application  of  the  arm's  length  principle  in  a  double taxation  agreement/  arrangement  (DTA)  context  is  stated  in  Article  9  (i.e. associated  enterprises  article)  of  the  MTC.    Paragraph  1  of  Article  9  states that:

## 'Where

- a) an  enterprise  of  a  Contracting  State  participates  directly  or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or
- b) the same  persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises  in  their  commercial  or  financial  relations  which  differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so  accrued,  may  be  included  in  the  profits  of  that  enterprise  and taxed accordingly.'

10. Paragraphs 1.6, 1.7 and 1.14 of the TPG explain that:
2. '1.6 … By seeking to adjust profits by reference to the conditions which  would  have  obtained  between  independent  enterprises

in  comparable  transactions  and  comparable  circumstances  … 'comparability analysis' is at the heart of the application of the arm's length principle ...

- 1.7 …  Paragraph  1  of Article  9  of  the  OECD  Model  Tax Convention is the foundation for comparability analyses because it introduces the need for:
-  A comparison between conditions (including prices, but not  only  prices)  made  or  imposed  between  associated enterprises  and  those  which  would  be  made  between independent enterprises …; and
-  A determination of the profits which would have accrued at arm's length ….
- 1.14 … The arm's length principle  …  adopts  as  a  benchmark  the normal operation of the market.'

## Commercial or financial relations between associated enterprises

11. Article 9 is concerned with the conditions and profits resulting from the  commercial  or  financial  relations  between  associated  enterprises,  not merely with the particular labels assigned to those relations.    The form chosen to  document  a  transaction  or  arrangement  does  not  necessarily  dictate  its substance, or whether it is commercially rational, or inform as to whether it has been undertaken at arm's length.    The application of the arm's length principle is  not  merely  an  exercise  in  pricing  the  legal  form  of  a  transaction  or arrangement seen in isolation and as presented.    It is important to consider the economic reality and effect of a transaction or arrangement (i.e. its substance), rather  than  proceeding  only  on  the  basis  of  how  it  has  been  characterized  or structured.
12. The  arm's  length  principle  effectively  requires  an  assessment  of whether the commercial or financial relations and ensuing conditions, transactions and the allocation of profits make commercial sense for all of the parties  to  the  transaction  or  arrangement,  judged  from  the  perspective  of independent parties dealing wholly independently with each other.

13. The  key  consideration  is  whether  the  transaction  or  arrangement conveys economic value from one enterprise to another: whether that benefit derives from tangible property, intangibles, services or other items or activities. An  independent  enterprise  will  be  willing  to  pay  for  an  activity  only  to  the extent that the activity confers on it a benefit of economic or commercial value.
14. Where independent enterprises in comparable circumstances would not have characterized and/ or structured the transaction or arrangement as the associated enterprises have, Article 9 allows an adjustment of the conditions, if appropriate,  to  reflect  those  which  the  parties  would  have  agreed  had  the transaction  or  arrangement  been  structured  and  characterized  in  accordance with  the  economic  and  commercial  reality  of  separate  and  independent enterprises dealing at arm's length.
15. This  raises  the  question  of  whether  the  transaction  or  arrangement would  have  happened  at  all,  or  on  those  conditions,  if  the  dealings  were between  independent  enterprises at arm's length. As  such, it requires consideration  of  whether  independent  enterprises,  acting  in  their  own  best interests and seeking to maximize the overall value to them from the economic resources  available  to  or  obtainable  by  them,  and  after  comparing  all  the options realistically available to them, would enter into that type of transaction or arrangement.    One arm's length option for such an enterprise may be not to enter into the transaction or arrangement.
16. In  practice,  it  may  be  appropriate  not  to  recognize  the  associated enterprises'  characterization  or  structuring  of  a  transaction  or  arrangement where, having regard to all of the facts and circumstances, it concludes that:
5. (a) the  economic  substance  of  the  transaction  or  arrangement differs from its form; or
6. (b) independent  enterprises  in  comparable  circumstances  would not have characterized or structured the transaction or arrangement  as  the  associated  enterprises  have,  and  arm's length pricing cannot reliably be determined for that transaction or arrangement.

Both  of these situations are instances where  the associated enterprises' characterization or structuring of the transaction or arrangement is regarded as the  result  of  conditions  that  would  not  have  existed  between  independent enterprises.

## Recognition of the accurately delineated transaction

17. Implicit in the concept of the arm's length principle is the notion that independent  enterprises  when  evaluating  the  terms  of  a  potential  deal  would compare the deal to the other options realistically available to them and would enter  the  deal  only  if  there  was  no  alternative  clearly  of  greater  commercial advantage to the enterprises.    It also includes the notion that an independent enterprise  would  not  enter  into  a  transaction  if  an  alternative  option  is realistically  available  and  clearly  more  attractive,  including  the  option  not  to enter into any commercial or financial relations.
18. The identification of arm's length provision depends on a survey of the commercial and financial relations and the provisions adopted by independent  enterprises  dealing  wholly  independently  with  one  another  in comparable circumstances.    Central to the identification of the relevant arm's length provision is a systematic and careful analysis of comparability circumstances including the contractual terms of the transactions; the functions performed, assets used and risk assumed by the parties; the characteristics of property  transferred  or  services  provided;  the  economic  circumstances  of  the parties  and  of  the  market  in  which  the  parties  operate;  and  the  business strategies pursued by the parties.
19. It is not of itself sufficient to infer that independent enterprises might have dealt with one another in an alternative manner.    This requirement must be  established.    Moreover,  the  mere  fact  that  actual  independent  enterprises have not been observed to deal with one another in a particular way (or that information on such independent dealings is not available) will not necessarily mean that independent enterprises would not have entered into the commercial or financial relations that the associated enterprises actually do.
20. It may be the case that it can be hypothesized on a rational basis that the actual commercial  and  financial relations, even though unique, are commercially  rational  and  best  serve  the  separate  commercial  and  economic

interests of the tested party having regard to the options realistically available to  it,  including  the  option  of  not  entering  the  tested  relations  if  independent enterprises would not have done so.

21. If property or service is purchased without a reasonable expectation of  being  able  to  exploit  the  purchased  property  or  service  either  directly  or indirectly  (e.g.  through  resale,  licence,  or  leasing  it  out),  then  its  realistically available option of not acquiring the property or services would be clearly more attractive than the actual acquisition, with the consequence that the acquisition would be commercially irrational.    Depending on the facts and circumstances, these will be the case where options were realistically available other than to enter  into  the  actual  transaction  or  arrangement  and  one  or  more  of  these options were more economically attractive (i.e. by its ability to contribute to the taxpayer's  profits,  by  increasing  its  gross  income  and/  or  reducing  its  costs) than the arrangement actually adopted.
22. Rule 1 is entirely consistent with the guidance provided in paragraphs 1.122 and 1.123 of the TPG, which states in part:
3. '1.122 … The transaction as accurately delineated may be disregarded,  and  if  appropriate,  replaced  by  an  alternative transaction,  where  the  arrangements  made  in  relation  to  the transaction, viewed in their totality, differ from those which would have been adopted by independent enterprises behaving  in  a  commercially  rational  manner  in  comparable circumstances,  thereby  preventing  determination  of  a  price that  would  be  acceptable  to  both  of  the  parties  taking  into account their respective perspectives and the options realistically available to each of them at the time of entering into the transaction. …
4. 1.123 The  key  question  in  the  analysis  is  whether  the  actual transaction possesses the commercial rationality of arrangements that would be agreed between unrelated parties under  comparable economic circumstances,  not whether the same  transaction can be observed between independent parties. …'

## Example 1

Corporation-HK resident in Hong Kong entered into an arrangement with  Associated  Corporation-F  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F,  whereby Corporation-HK would sell its entitlement to all intellectual property rights (if any) arising as a result of its future  research  and development activities conducted during the term of the arrangement to Associated Corporation-F in return for a lump sum payment.    In documenting the transactions, Corporation-HK encountered difficulties in valuation because the intellectual property rights had not  come  into  existence.    In  addition,  Corporation-HK  undertook comparability analysis and testing using appropriate transfer pricing procedures and methods in accordance with the TPG and revealed the following:

- (a) there  was  no  market  based  evidence  such  as  comparable uncontrolled transactions or other comparable data supporting Corporation-HK's sale of future intellectual property rights for an advance payment of a fixed lump sum amount;
- (b) the static pricing mechanism used in such an arrangement was unusual  and  would  likely  be  unacceptable  to  both  an  arm's length transferor and an arm's length transferee;
- (c) it  did  not make commercial sense for Corporation-HK to sell the entitlement to intellectual property rights for a fixed lump sum payment, and
- (d) the actual structure of the transaction adopted by Corporation-HK impeded the identification of an appropriate transfer price.

The arrangement was commercially irrational since neither Corporation-HK nor Corporation-F had any reliable means to determine  whether  the  lump  sum  payment  reflected  an  appropriate valuation.    It was uncertain what research and development activities Corporation-HK  might  conduct  over  the  period  of  the  arrangement. Valuing the potential outcomes would be entirely speculative.

In accordance with the guidance laid down in the TPG, the structure of  the  arrangement  adopted  by  Corporation-HK and Corporation-F, including the form of payment, should be modified for the purposes of  transfer  pricing  analysis.    The  replacement  structure  should  be guided  by  the  economically  relevant  characteristics,  including  the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by Corporation-HK  and  Corporation-F  as  well  as  their  commercial  or financial relations.    Those facts would narrow the range of potential replacement structures to the structure most consistent with the facts of the case.

## RULE 1

## Arm's length principle for provi s ion between associated persons

23. Rule 1 requires income or loss from transactions between associated persons to be computed on an arm's length basis.    Section 50AAF contains the detailed provisions relating to the application of the arm's length principle for a provision between associated persons.
24. Section  50AAF(1)  provides  that  if  the  following  circumstances happen:
3. (a) a  provision  (actual  provision)  has  been  made  or  imposed  as between  2  persons  (each  an  affected  person)  by  means  of  a transaction or series of transaction;
4. (b) the participation condition is met under section 50AAG;
5. (c) the actual provision differs from the provision that would have been  made  or  imposed  as  between  two  independent  persons (arm's length provision); and
6. (d) the actual provision confers a potential advantage in relation to Hong Kong tax on an affected person (advantaged person),

then, for the purpose of Hong Kong tax, the advantaged person's income or loss

is to be computed as if the arm's length provision had been made or imposed instead  of  the  actual  provision.    The  amount  of  income  or  loss  computed  is referred to as the arm's length amount .

25. Section  50AAF(1)  requires  a  comparison  to  be  made  between  the actual provision made between the two associated persons, and the arm's length provision  (i.e.  the  provision  which  would  have  been  made  as  between independent  persons).    If  there  is  a  difference  between  the  actual  provision and the arm's length provision, and the actual provision confers a potential tax advantage on one of the associated persons, an adjustment is required in the tax computation of the advantaged person to reflect what would have happened had the arm's length provision been made.

## DTA not prerequisite for the application of Rule 1

26. The existence of a DTA is not a prerequisite for application of Rule 1. Section  50AAD(2)  of  the  IRO  provides  that  Rule  1  has  effect  regardless  of whether any of the associated persons is  chargeable  to  foreign  tax  in  a  DTA territory.    However,  DTAs  will  invariably  contain  an  associated  enterprises article.

## Interpretation consistent with the OECD rules

27. Section  50AAE  of  the  IRO  requires,  among  other  things,  that sections 50AAF, 50AAG, 50AAM and 50AAN of the IRO are to be construed in  a  way  that  best  secures  consistency  with  the  OECD  rules.    Insofar  as  is relevant, the OECD rules refer to:
2. (a) the commentary on the associated enterprises article contained in the MTC; and
3. (b) the TPG.
28. The  inclusion  of  the  adverb  'best'  in  the  equivocal  phrase  'best secures consistency' recognizes that:
5. (a) there might be choice between two or more approaches to the identification of the arm's length provision; and

- (b) when determining the effect given to section 50AAF, it might not be possible to identify the arm's length provision so as to achieve total consistency with the relevant OECD rules.

Therefore, the approach which achieves the highest level of consistency with the OECD rules is to be preferred.

## Transfer pricing and locality of profits

29. The broad guiding principle as explained in Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 21 would not be affected as a result of the enactment of Rule 1 in Part 8AA.    Rule 1 requires the computation of profits from transactions between associated persons on an arm's length basis for tax purposes. After ascertaining the amount  of  profits, the broad guiding principle would be applied to determine whether and, if so, the extent to which such profits arose in or were derived from Hong Kong.    In deciding the source of profits, the broad guiding principle is to see what has been done to earn the profits  in  question  and  where  the  operations  have  been  performed.    The two-step approach should not conflict with OECD's Actions 8-10 - 2015 Final Reports :  it  is  expected  that  profits  will  be  reported  where  the  economic activities that generate them are carried out and where value is created.
30. Profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong shall be fully charged to profits tax and will not be reduced unless the Commissioner is obligated to provide  corresponding  relief  under  section  50AAM  or  50AAN.    A  person carrying  on  a  trade  or  business  in  Hong  Kong  cannot  unilaterally  apply  any transfer pricing methodology to reduce its profits sourced from Hong Kong.

## Notice and assessment process

31. Section 50AAF(3), as a due process, provides that the Assessor may give a notice requiring the advantaged person to prove that the amount of the person's income or loss as stated in the person's tax return is the arm's length amount.
32. Section  50AAF(5)  provides  that  if  the  person  fails  to  prove  to  the Assessor's satisfaction that the amount of income or loss stated in the persons' tax return is the arm's length amount, the Assessor must estimate an amount as

the arm's length amount and, taking into account the estimated amount:

- (a) make an assessment or additional assessment on the person; or
- (b) issue  a  computation  of  loss,  or  revise  a  computation  of  loss resulting in a smaller amount of computed loss, in respect of the person.
33. The combined effect of section 50AAF(3) and (5) should enable the Assessor to make an upward adjustment if the amount stated in the advantaged person's tax return is not an arm's length amount, whilst before that the person must be provided with an opportunity to substantiate its reporting in tax return.
34. Section 50AAF(6) provides that the estimated amount is taken to be the  arm's  length  amount  unless  the  advantaged  person  proves  that  another amount is an equally reliable measure, or a more reliable measure, of the arm's length  amount.    This  aligns  with  the  burden  of  proof  for  other  tax  matters under the IRO. As transfer pricing is driven by specific facts and circumstances and involves comparisons with similar arm's length transactions, the advantaged person is far more likely to hold the relevant information and should be in a better position to support its pricing than the Commissioner.

## Protection of revenue base

35. Section  50AAF  aims  to  prevent  under-assessment  of  income  or over-allowance  of  loss  to  the  advantaged  person.    It  is  not  to  be  used  to achieve double deduction or double non-taxation.    The notice and assessment mechanism in section  50AAF(3)  to  (5)  allows  the  Assessor  to  make  upward adjustments.    Downward  adjustments  would  only  be  considered  by  way  of corresponding relief under section 50AAM or 50AAN.
36. Rule 1 should not be used to achieve double non-taxation of profits or  income.    It  cannot  be  applied  to  reduce  assessable  profits  derived  by  a person from the relevant activities undertaken in Hong Kong with respect to a transaction with an associated person, unless a primary upward adjustment has been made on the associated person with respect to the same transaction.    In such circumstances, unless the upward adjustment made is accepted as correct, the Commissioner is under no obligation to provide any corresponding relief.

37. Where  there  is  any  difficulty  in  obtaining  information  about  the profits  of  a  non-Hong  Kong  resident  associated  person  under  the  domestic information  powers,  the  Commissioner  may  resort  to  the  assistance  from  the competent authority of the relevant tax jurisdiction pursuant to the exchange of information  article  under  the  relevant  DTA  or  the  Convention  on  Mutual Administrative  Assistance  in  Tax  Matters,  or  the  relevant  tax  information exchange agreement.

## APPLICATION OF RULE 1

## Scope of application

38. Section  50AAF  would  apply  in  determining  an  affected  person's liability for property tax, salaries tax and profits tax in Hong Kong.    Section 7D, 13A and 26AC have clarified this point.    Tax adjustments across tax types may be required for non-arm's length transactions.    This is because many tax jurisdictions  operate  a  comprehensive  income  tax  system  and  Hong  Kong needs to ensure that the transfer pricing rules apply to all types of taxes within the international context.

## Example 2

Corporation-F resident in Jurisdiction-F operated a branch in Hong Kong.    The  director  of  Corporation-F,  who  was  resident  in  Hong Kong and had more than half of the beneficial interest in Corporation-F, leased a property located in Hong Kong he owned, to the  Hong  Kong  branch.    The  profits  accrued  to  the  Hong  Kong branch  was  revised  upwards  by  the  tax  authority  of  Jurisdiction-F under  the  associated  enterprises  article  of  the  DTA  between  Hong Kong and Jurisdiction-F on the grounds that the director charged the Hong Kong branch a rent well above the market rate.

Under  section  50AAH,  the  director  controlled  Corporation-F  since he had more than half of the beneficial interest in Corporation-F.    If the transfer pricing adjustment made  by  the tax authority of Jurisdiction-F was accepted as being correct both in principle and in amount, an appropriate downward adjustment would be made on the

director's  income  for  property  tax  purposes  under  section  50AAN. It should be noted that persons subject to control in section 50AAH(1)(a) do not include individuals.

## Example 3

Corporation-HK  resident  in  Hong  Kong  purchased  finished  goods from  Associated  Corporation-F  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F  and  sold the  same  to  various  customers  located  outside  Hong  Kong.    In Hong Kong, Corporation-HK received and placed orders, arranged shipment and trade financing, collected and made payments.    After a tax audit, an upward  adjustment  was  made  on Associated Corporation-F  by  the  tax  authority  of  Jurisdiction-F  under  the associated  enterprises  article  of  the  DTA  between  Hong  Kong  and Jurisdiction-F  on  the  grounds  that  Corporation-HK  paid  less  than the market price for the finished goods.

If  the  transfer  pricing  adjustment  made  by  the  tax  authority  of Jurisdiction-F was accepted as being correct both in principle and in amount,  an  appropriate  downward  adjustment  would  be  made  on Corporation-HK's  income  for  profits  tax  purposes  under  section 50AAN.

39. In general, Rule 1 applies to transactions between associated persons. However, insofar as domestic transactions between associated persons do not give rise to actual tax difference, or relate to interest-free loans which are not granted  in  the  ordinary  course  of  money  lending  or  intra-group  financing business, provided that such transactions do not have a tax avoidance purpose, the  advantaged  persons  will  not  be  obliged  to  compute  the  income  or  loss arising  from  these  transactions  on  the  basis  of  the  arm's  length  provision  in their  tax  returns  and  no  corresponding  assessment  on  that  basis  will  be required.

## CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGIES

## Provision

40. The word 'provision' embraces all the terms and conditions attaching to a transaction or series of transactions.    It is broadly equivalent to the expression 'conditions made or imposed' adopted in Article 9 of the MTC. 'Provision' is not limited to a formal or enforceable term or condition but may be  of  a  similar  nature,  since  it  may  be  made  by  means  of  such  informal arrangements or understandings: see DSG Retail Ltd and others v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2009] STC (SCD) 397.
41. Section 50AAF(2) provides that the cases in which a provision made or imposed as between two associated persons is to be taken to differ from the provision  that  would  have  been  made  or  imposed  as  between  independent persons include a case in which provision is made or imposed as between two persons  but  no  provision  would  have  been  made  or  imposed  as  between independent persons.

## Affected persons

42. The basic criterion for application  of  Rule  1  requires  there  to  be  a provision  made  or  imposed  between  two  affected  persons  by  means  of  a transaction  or  a  series  of  transactions.    Rule  1  may  apply  by  analogy  to internal  dealings  between  the  head  office  and  an  overseas  branch.    It  is  also applicable  for  transactions  between  an  overseas  branch  and  an    associated corporations.

## Transaction and a series of transactions

43. The word 'transaction' is defined in section 50AAI to include any operation,  scheme,  arrangement,  understanding  and  mutual  practice  (whether express or implied, and whether  or not enforceable or intended to be enforceable by legal proceedings).    The definition of 'transaction' in section 50AAI is wider than that provided in section 61A.
44. A  series  of  transactions  includes  a  number  of  transactions  each entered into (whether or not one after the other) in pursuance of, or in relation

to the same matter.    Transactions within a series of transactions do not have to occur  in  a  recognizable  sequence.    They  may  be  simultaneous  or  remote  in time from one another, but they have to be part of an overall arrangement or scheme.

45. A  series  of  transactions  is  not  prevented  from  being  regarded  as  a series of transactions by means of which a provision has been made or imposed as between any two persons, even if one or more of the following applies:
2. (a) there is no transaction in the series to which both those persons are parties;
3. (b) the  parties  to  any  arrangement  or  scheme  in  pursuance  of which  the  transactions  in  the  series  are  entered  into  do  not include one or both of those persons;
4. (c) there is one or more transactions in the series to which neither of those persons is a party.

## Example 4

Parent  Corporation-F1  in  Jurisdiction-F1,  with  a  wholly-owned Subsidiary  Corporation-HK  in  Hong  Kong,  sold  goods  to  Third Party Corporation-F1 in Jurisdiction-F1. Subsequently, Third Party Corporation-F1 sold the same goods to Third Party Subsidiary Corporation-F2, its subsidiary in Jurisdiction-F2, which in turn sold the goods to Subsidiary Corporation-HK.

<!-- image -->

There was no direct transaction between Parent Corporation-F1 and Subsidiary  Corporation-HK;  third  parties  were  involved;  and  the transaction marked with an asterisk involved neither Parent Corporation-F1  nor  Subsidiary  Corporation-HK  as  parties.    These facts  should  not  prevent  the  existence  of  a  provision  between  the Parent Corporation-F1 and Subsidiary Corporation-HK for the purposes of Rule 1, as long as the transaction was made in pursuance of, or in relation to, the same matter.

## Example 5

Parent  Corporation-HK  in  Hong  Kong  provided  a  guarantee  to Bank-F in Jurisdiction-F which made a loan to Subsidiary Corporation-HK in Hong Kong.

<!-- image -->

The  fact  that  the  guarantee  between  Parent  Corporation-HK  and Bank-F did not involve Subsidiary Corporation-HK did not prevent the  existence  of  a  provision  between  Parent  Corporation-HK  and Subsidiary Corporation-HK, as long as the transactions were pursuant to the same arrangement.

46. In relation to a provision made or imposed as between two persons by means of a transaction or series of transactions, Rule 1 has effect:

- (a) regardless  of  whether  either  person  is,  or  both  persons  are, chargeable to foreign tax; and
- (b) if  either  person  is,  or  both  persons  are,  chargeable  to  foreign tax - regardless of whether the foreign tax is chargeable in a DTA territory.

## Participation

47. As between affected persons, the participation condition is met under section  50AAG  if,  at  the  time  of  the  making  or  imposition  of  the  actual provision:
2. (a) one of the affected persons was participating in the management, control or capital of the other affected person; or
3. (b) the  same  person  or  persons  was  or  were  participating  in  the management  or  control  or  capital  of  each  of  the  affected persons.
48. A person ( person A ) is participating in the management, control or capital of another person ( person B )  at  a  particular time only if, at that time, person B is:
5. (a) a  corporation,  partnership,  trustee  (whether  incorporated  or unincorporated) or a body of persons; and
6. (b) controlled by person A.

In general, an individual cannot be controlled though an individual can control an entity  and  the  participation  condition  restricts  the  application  to  situations where a person controls another person.

## Example 6

Associated  Corporation-HK  and  Associated  Corporation-F  were corporations carrying on business in Hong Kong and Jurisdiction-F respectively.    Associated Corporation-HK held all the shares issued by Associated Corporation-F at the time of the making or imposition of the actual provision of a transaction between them.

<!-- image -->

Participating person can be: corporation, partnership, trustee, body of persons or individual

Controlled person can be: corporation, partnership, trustee or body of persons

The participation  condition  was  met  since  Associated  CorporationHK  had  more  than  half  of  the  beneficial  interest  in  Associated Corporation-F.    If the Associated Corporation-F was replaced by an individual, the participating condition would not be met because an individual could not be subject to the control of another person.

## Control

49. Person B is controlled by person A if one of the following conditions is met:

- (a) Person A has the power to secure that the affairs of person B are  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  wishes  of  person  A because:
- (i) person  A  has  more  than  half  of  the  direct  or  indirect beneficial  interest  in  or  in  relation  to  person  B  or  any other corporation, partnership, trustee (whether incorporated or unincorporated) or a body of persons;
- (ii) person A is, directly or indirectly, entitled to exercise or control the exercise of more than half of the voting rights in  or  in  relation  to  person  B  or  any  other  corporation, partnership, trustee (whether incorporated or unincorporated) or a body of person; or
- (iii) of  powers  conferred  on  person  A  by  the  constitutional document regulating person B or any other corporation, partnership, trustee (whether incorporated or unincorporated) or a body of persons; or

- (b) Person  B  is  accustomed  or  under  an  obligation  (whether express or implied, and whether or not enforceable or intended to  be  enforceable  by  legal  proceedings)  to  act,  in  relation  to person B's investment or business affairs, in accordance with the directions, instructions or wishes of person A.
50. The  definition  of  control  is  derived  from  section  16(3A)  of  and Schedules 15 and 15A to the IRO.

## Beneficial interest (

51. In  determining  whether  person  A  has  a  direct  beneficial  interest  in person B, the extent of the beneficial interest of person A in person B is:
2. (a) if person B is a corporation that is not a trustee of a trust estate: the  percentage  of  the  issued  share  capital  of  the  corporation held by person A;
3. (b) if person B is a partnership that is not a trustee of a trust estate: the  percentage  of  the  income  of  the  partnership  to  which person A is entitled;
4. (c) if person B is a trustee of a trust estate: the percentage in value of the trust estate in which person A is interested; or
5. (d) if  person  B  is  an  entity  that  does  not  fall  within  any  of  the above: the percentage of person A's ownership interest in the entity.

## Indirect beneficial interest through interposed person

52. If  person  A  has  an  indirect  beneficial  interest  in,  or  is  indirectly entitled to exercise or control the exercise of voting rights in, person B through another person (i.e.  an  interposed  person),  the  extent  of  beneficial  interest  or voting  rights  of  person  A  in  person  B  is  calculated  by  multiplying  the percentage  representing  the  extent  of  the  beneficial  interest  or  voting  rights held by the persons in the chain.

## Example 7

Corporation-1 held Corporation-4 through Corporation-2 and Corporation-3,  two  interposed  corporations.    Corporation-1  held 90%  shares  in  Corporation-2;  Corporation-2  held  80%  shares  in Corporation-3; and Corporation-3 held 70% shares in Corporation-4.

Percentage of beneficial interest held by Corporation-1 in Corporation-4 was: 90% × 80% × 70% = 50.4%.

## Potential advantage in relation to Hong Kong tax

53. Section 50AAJ provides that there is a potential advantage in relation to Hong Kong tax on a person if the person's:
2. (a) income for a year of assessment is reduced, or
3. (b) loss for a year of assessment is created or increased

as an effect of the provision not being on an arm's length position.

54. Where there is a potential advantage, it should be addressed in the tax return for the year of assessment in which it arises.    Often only one person to  the  transaction  will  be  potentially  advantaged  by  the  actual  provision. However, if  both  persons  to  the  transaction  are  potentially  advantaged  by  it, then both would need to make an adjustment.

## Example 8

Associated  Corporation-HK  in  Hong  Kong  paid  a  service  fee  to Associated  Corporation-F  in  Jurisdiction-F.    The  fee  was  charged at a price higher than an arm's length price.

The charging of a non-arm's length fee caused Associated Corporation-HK  to  have  a  smaller  amount  of  income  or  larger amount  of  loss,  as  the  case  may  be.    The  transaction  (i.e.  the payment of a non-arm's length service fee) conferred a potential tax

advantage in relation to Hong Kong tax on Associated Corporation-HK.

## EXEMPTED DOMESTIC TRANSACTIONS

## Actual provisions not giving rise to any potential advantage

55. An actual provision is not  taken to confer a potential advantage in relation to Hong Kong tax on either of the two affected persons if:
2. (a) the domestic nature condition is met;
3. (b) either the no actual tax difference condition or the non-business loan condition is met; and
4. (c) the actual provision does not have a tax avoidance purpose.

## Domestic nature condition

56. The domestic nature condition is met:
2. (a) if the actual provision is made or imposed in connection with each affected person's trade, profession or business carried on in Hong Kong; or
3. (b) if an affected person is resident for tax purposes in Hong Kong and the actual provision is:
4. (i) made or imposed otherwise than in connection with that person's trade, profession or business; and
5. (ii) made or imposed in connection  with  the  other  affected person's trade, profession or business carried on in Hong Kong.

## No actual tax difference condition

57. The no actual tax difference condition is met if:
2. (a) each affected person's income  arising from the relevant activities  is  chargeable  to  Hong  Kong  tax  or  each  affected person's loss so arising is allowable for the purposes of Hong Kong tax; and
3. (b) no concession or exemption for Hong Kong tax applies to any affected  person's  income  or  loss  arising  from  the  relevant activities.
58. The  no  actual  tax  difference  condition  seeks  to  ensure  that  the income  or  loss  of  the  affected  persons  from  the  relevant  activities  is  to  be brought into account for the purposes of Hong Kong tax.    The affected person is regarded as having a 'loss allowable' for the purposes of Hong Kong tax if a loss (i.e. taxable income is less than allowable deductions) is sustained from the relevant activities.
59. If  the  actual  provision  does  not  confer  a  potential  advantage  in relation to Hong Kong tax within the meaning of paragraph 53, Rule 1 will not come into operation and it is therefore not necessary to consider whether the no actual  tax  difference  condition  is  met.    For  example,  the  actual  provision involves  a  non-taxable  capital  gain  and  non-deductible  capital  expenditure without resulting in a smaller amount of taxable income or a larger amount of tax loss for either of the affected persons.

## Example 9

Associated Corporation-HK1 sold its manufactured goods to Associated  Corporation-HK2.    The  same  goods  were  then  sold  by Associated  Corporation-HK2  to  customers  located  outside  Hong Kong.    Associated  Corporation-HK1  was  subject  to  profits  tax  in respect  of  profits  derived  from  manufacturing  while  Associated Corporation-HK2  was  subject  to  profits  tax  in  respect  of  profits derived from sale of goods.

The no actual tax difference was met since: Associated Corporation-HK1 was chargeable to profits tax in respect of profits derived  from  the  manufacture  of  the  goods  sold  to  Associated Corporation-HK2 (i.e. the relevant activities of Associated Corporaiton-HK1); Associated  Corporation-HK2 was chargeable to profits tax in respect of profits derived from the sale of the goods to overseas customers (i.e. the relevant activities of Associated Corporaiton-HK2);  and  no  concession  or  exemption  for  profits  tax applied to the profits of Associated Corporation-HK1 and Associated Corporation-HK2 derived from the relevant activities.

## Example 10

Associated Corporation-HK1 paid a management fee to Associated Corporation-HK2. For Associated Corporation-HK1, the management fee was tax deductible and for Associated Corporation-HK2, the management fee was taxable.

Associated Corporation-HK2  was  chargeable  in  respect of the income arising from the relevant activities (i.e. the management fee). If  the  income  of  Associated  Corporation-HK1  arising  from  the relevant activities (i.e.  the  activities  in  the  course  of  which  or  with respect to which the management fee was incurred) was chargeable to profits tax; and no exemption or concession for profits tax applied to  the  income  of  Associated  Corporation-HK1  and  Associated Corporation-  HK2  from  the  relevant  activities,  the  no  actual  tax difference  condition  would be  met.    Sections  16  and  17,  however, would remain relevant in determining whether the management fee was deductible for Associated Corporation-HK1.

## Example 11

Associated Corporation-HK1 was carrying on a property development business in Hong Kong.    Associated Corporation-HK2, the parent company, was carrying on an investment holding business in Hong Kong.    Associated Corporation-HK1 borrowed a loan from Associated Corporation-HK2  to acquire land and construct a property  thereon  for  sale  or  investment  purpose  in  Hong  Kong.

Associated Corporation-HK1 and Associated Corporation-HK2 were both subject to profits tax.

Associated Corporation-HK1 was chargeable to profits tax in respect of its profits from the sale or letting of the property.    In determining such profits, the interest expense incurred, if any, on the loan from Associated Corporation-HK2 would be recognized as part of the cost of  construction  of  the  property  and  deducted  as  the  cost  of  trading stock  or  by  way  of  commercial  building  allowance/  industrial building  allowance.    Associated  Corporation-HK2,  on  the  other hand, was chargeable to profits tax in respect of the interest income derived from the loan.    That is to say both the income of Associated Corporation-HK1 and Associated Corporation-HK2 arising from the relevant activities was chargeable to Hong Kong tax.    Provided that no concession or exemption for profits tax applied to such income, the no actual tax difference condition would be regarded as having been met.

## Example 12

Associated Corporation-HK1 was carrying on business as a retailer in  Hong Kong.    It  purchased  goods from Associated CorporationHK2 which was carrying on business as a wholesaler in Hong Kong. Both Associated Corporation-HK1 and Associated Corporation-HK2 were subject to profits tax in respect of the profits arising from the relevant  activities.    Associated  Corporation-HK1  was  in  a  tax paying position while Associated Corporation-HK2 was in a tax loss position for the same year.

The  no  actual  tax  difference  condition  was  met  if:  Associated Corporation-HK1's income arising  from  the  relevant  activities  was chargeable  to  Hong  Kong  tax,  and  Associated  Corporation-HK2's loss  so  arising  was  allowable  for  profits  tax  purposes;  and  no concession or exemption for Hong Kong tax applied to such income or  loss.    The  timing  difference  between  the  deduction  of  purchase cost  for  Associated  Corporation-HK1  and  the  taxation  of  sale proceeds for Associated Corporation-HK2 would not be a consideration when determining whether the no actual tax difference

condition was met.    The mere fact that one of the affected persons was in a tax loss position would not by itself render this condition not satisfied.

## Example 13

Group-HK was engaged in the design, manufacture and distribution of  travel  accessories  in  the  Asia  Pacific  region.    Its  headquarters and distribution hub were located in Hong Kong while its factories were  located  in  other  jurisdictions  in  the  Asia  Pacific  region. Associated  Corporation-HK1,  carrying  on  business  in  Hong  Kong, was responsible for organising online marketing campaigns used in the  Asia  Pacific  region.    Associated  Corporation-HK1  provided marketing  services  in  Hong  Kong  to  Associated  Corporation-HK2 which  was  responsible  for  the  distribution  of  products  purchased from  affiliate  factories  to  independent  retailers  in  Hong  Kong  and other jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region.    In return, Associated Corporation-HK1 was entitled to a service fee based on a mark-up on its cost incurred in the provision of such services.

Associated Corporation-HK1 was chargeable to profits tax in respect of the service fee from Associated Corporation-HK2.    If the profits accrued  to  Associated  Corporation-HK2  from  the  sales  of  goods were derived from Hong Kong and chargeable to profits tax, the no actual tax difference condition would be met.    If the profits accrued to  Associated Corporation-HK2 were not derived from Hong Kong and  not  chargeable  to  profits  tax,  the  no  actual  tax  difference condition  would  not  be  met.    If  the  profits  accrued  to  Associated Corporation- HK2 were partly derived from Hong Kong and partly derived  outside  Hong  Kong,  the  no  actual  tax  difference  condition would be regarded as having been met in respect of that part of the service fee attributable to the production of the chargeable profits of Associated Corporation-HK2.

## Example 14

Associated  Corporation-HK1  was  the  owner  of  office  buildings situated  in  Hong  Kong.    Associated  Corporation-HK2  was  the property manager providing property management  services to Associated Corporation-HK1.    The assessable profits of Associated Corporation-HK1  and  Associated  Corporation-HK2  for  a  year  of assessment were $10 million and $2 million respectively. Associated Corporation-HK2 made an election for assessment of its profits at the two-tiered profits tax rates.

Though  the  effective  tax  rate  of  Associated  Corporation-HK2  was lower  than  that  of  Associated  Corporation-HK1,  the  transaction between  Associated  Corporation-HK1  and  Associated  CorporationHK2 met the no actual tax difference condition since the two-tiered profits  tax  rates  regime  was  not  regarded  as  a  concession  or exemption for Hong Kong tax.

## Example 15

Partnership-HK1  engaged  primarily  in the business consulting activities  and  provided strategic consultancy services to Associated Corporation-HK2.    In  return,  Partnership-HK1  was  entitled  to  a service fee from Associated Corporation-HK2. Profits of Partnership-HK and Corporation-HK were charged at a rate of 15% and 16.5% respectively.

The  tax  rate  difference  between  a  partnership  and  a  corporation would not preclude the transaction between them from fulfilling the no  actual  tax  difference  condition.    It  should  be  noted  that  the transaction should not have a tax avoidance purpose.

## Non-business loan condition

60. The non-business loan condition is met if the actual provision relates to lending money otherwise than in the ordinary course of a business of lending money or an intra-group financing business as defined by section 16(3).

61. In  determining  whether  a  company  is  carrying  on  an  intra-group financing business, reference can be made to Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 52.
62. Having regard to the totality of facts, it is considered that a company merely  engaging  in  providing  interest-free  loans  with  interest-free  funds  to associated persons without any motive to earn a profit from interest spread may not be regarded as carrying on an intra-group financing business.    Even if the company is regarded as carrying on an intra-group financing business (i.e. the non-business loan condition is not met), the no actual tax difference condition and the locality of interest should be considered before deciding whether arm's length  interest  is  to  be  imputed  on  the  relevant  company  and  whether  such interest is chargeable to profits tax.

## Example 16

Associated  Corporation-HK1  was  a  property  developer.    It  set  up various  special  purpose  vehicles  for  acquiring  land  lots  for  a property  development  project.    To  finance  the  acquisition  of  land lots, Associated Corporation-HK2, a special purpose vehicle, borrowed  funds  from  Associated  Corporation-HK1.    Associated CorporationHK1  and  Associated Corporation-HK2 were not carrying on money  lending or intra-group financing business. Associated  Corporation-HK1  applied  its  own  funds  to  finance  its lending to Associated Corporation-HK2.

The  non-business  loan  condition  was  met  as  the  interest-free  loan was not lent by Associated Corporation-HK1 to Associated Corporation- HK2 in the course of a money lending or an intra-group financing business.

## Example 17

Associated Corporation-HK1 was carrying on a property development business in Hong Kong.    Associated Corporation-HK2, the parent company, was carrying on an investment holding business in Hong Kong. Associated Corporation-HK1 borrowed an interest-free  loan  from  Associated  Corporation-HK2  to  finance  its

long-term  equity  investment  (accepted  as  capital  in  nature)  in  a number of property development companies in Hong Kong. Associated Corporation-HK1 and Associated Corporation-HK2 were both  subject  to  profits  tax.    Dividends  and  gains  from  the  equity investment would not be chargeable to profits tax.

Since the income of Associated Corporation-HK1 derived from the relevant activities (i.e.  dividends and gains  derived from the equity investment in property development companies) was not chargeable to profits tax, the no actual tax difference condition was not met.    If the loan was not made in the ordinary course of a business of money lending or an intra-group financing business of Associated Corporation-HK2, the non-business loan condition would be met.

## No tax avoidance condition

63. An actual provision has a tax avoidance purpose if the Commissioner is satisfied that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the provision is to utilize a loss sustained by an affected person to avoid, postpone or reduce any liability, whether of the other affected person or any other person, to Hong Kong tax.
64. The  expression  'main  purpose  or  one  of  the  main  purposes'  is widely used in the IRO and DTAs.    Cases including Marwood Homes Ltd v IRC [1999] STC (SCD) 44, Snell v RCC [2008] STC (SCD) 1094, Lloyds TSB Equipment Leasing (No. 1) Ltd v RCC [2014] STC 2770 and Travel Document Service  &amp;  Ladbroke  Group  International  v  HMRC [2018]  STC  723  confirm that  a  transaction  can  have  more  than  one  main  purpose  and  obtaining  a  tax advantage can be a main object of a transaction.    In order for a purpose to be 'main', it  must  have  a  connotation  of  importance.    All  relevant  facts  of  the case have to be considered before reaching a conclusion under such test.
65. Whether  specified  transactions  had  been  carried  out  for  bona  fide commercial reasons and without the obtaining of a tax advantage as the main object  or  one  of  the  main  objects  was  a  subjective  matter  of  intention  to  be ascertained by looking at the transactions as a whole and in their proper context. Where  the  object  to  be  determined  was  that  of  a  company,  the  fact-finding tribunal had to determine that object from the intentions of those who governed

the policy of the company in the area where the transaction or transactions in question fell.    That might involve looking at the intentions of the directors or of  the  shareholders  or,  where  appropriate,  the  professional  advisers.    The contemporary documents were the most reliable indicators of the intentions of the relevant parties.

66. Transfer pricing looks to charge the right amount of tax on the right person in the right jurisdiction.    It seeks to ensure that, for tax purposes, the profits  from  a  transaction  or  series  of  transactions  are  computed  on  an  arm's length  basis  and  are  taxed  on  the  appropriate  person  in  the  appropriate jurisdiction.    Hence,  if  a  Hong  Kong  resident  person  stands  to  pay  less  tax because the transaction took place between  associated persons and the actual provision conferred a potential advantage in relation to Hong Kong tax, then an adjustment  under  Rule  1  is  required  to  adjust  the  tax  computation  of  the advantaged person to deny the tax advantage.
67. Under Rule 1, the actual provision is only substituted by the arm's length provision for tax purposes when there is a potential advantage in relation to  Hong  Kong  tax.    An  adjustment  will  not  be  made  where  the  effect  is opposite.    That  is,  Rule  1  only  applies  to  increase  the  assessable  profits  or reduce the allowable losses in Hong Kong and hence operates as a 'one-way street'.    The test is to establish whether the actual provision is the same as the arm's  length  provision.    In  case  there  is  any  Hong  Kong  tax  disadvantage because of a transfer pricing adjustment, the person has to seek a corresponding downward adjustment under section 50AAM or 50AAN.

## GRANDFATHERED TRANSACTIONS

## Transactions before commencement date

68. Section 4(3) of Schedule 44 to the IRO provides, among others, that section 50AAF does not apply to a transaction entered into or effected before the  commencement date  of  the  2018  Amendment  (No.  6)  Ordinance  (i.e.  13 July  2018).    It  refers  to  a  transaction  and  not  to  a  contract.    Therefore,  the key question is  whether the  act  or  activity  can  constitute  a  transaction  on  its own after the commencement date.

## Example 18

Associated Corporation-HK signed a master agreement with Associated  Corporation-F,  its  associated  corporation  resident  in Jurisdiction-F, on 1 July 2018 allowing Associated Corporation-HK to  purchase  products  from  Associated  Corporation-F  in  next  one year  under  the  specified  contractual  terms  (e.g.  price,  delivery period, credit period, etc.). Associated Corporation-HK then placed a purchase order on 30 September 2018, of which the terms strictly followed those agreed in the master agreement.

The signing of a master agreement might not necessarily result in a transaction.    In this case, the key question was whether the purchase, as  evidenced  by  the  purchase  order  placed  on  30  September  2018, was  capable  of  constituting  a  transaction  on  its own.    If the purchase  constituted  a  separate  transaction  on  its  own,  then  it  was clear  that  the  purchase  was  not  a  transaction  entered  into  or  given effect prior to the commencement of the 2018 Amendment (No. 6) Ordinance and the purchase could not be grandfathered.    To decide on this question, it may be necessary to consider whether a breach of the terms relating to the purchase order would constitute a breach of all the purchase orders previously placed in accordance with terms of the master agreement.

## Example 19

MNE Group-A is an IT consulting service provider.    Its subsidiary, Corporation-F  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F,  specialized  in  software development  and  data  analytics.    On  1  July  2018,  Associated Corporation-F  entered  into  a  master  service  agreement  which stipulated the general legal terms and conditions for the services to be provided by Associated Corporation-F to the group companies of MNE  Group-A,  without  specific scope and fee. Each  group company had to negotiate and conclude a separate statement of work with a prescribed scope and fee for a particular service provided by Associated Corporation-F. Associated Corporation-HK, a subsidiary  company  of  MNE  Group-A  resident  in  Hong  Kong, engaged  Associated  Corporation-F  to  develop  mobile  applications

with a separate statement of work on 15 July 2018.

The  transaction  between  Corporation-HK  and  Corporation-F  was governed  by  a  separate  statement  of  work  concluded  after  the commencement  date  of  the  2018  Amendment  (No.  6)  Ordinance. Thus, the transaction would not be considered as entered into before the commencement date.

## Example 20

Associated Corporation-HK resident in Hong Kong owned a registered trademark.    Before the commencement date of the 2018 Amendment (No. 6) Ordinance, a licensing agreement was signed to license the trademark  to  Associated  Corporation-F  resident  in Jurisdiction-F.    In return, Associated Corporation-HK was entitled to a yearly royalty from Corporation-F by reference to the volume of sales of the branded goods to customers in Jurisdiction-F.    The first effective year relating to the royalty was the financial year ended 31 December 2019.

The  royalty  payable  by  Associated  Corporation-F  each  year  would depend  on  the  volume  of  sales  of  branded  goods  of  each  relevant year after the commencement date of the 2018 Amendment (No. 6) Ordinance.    If  there  was  no  sales,  no  royalty  would  be  payable. Each payment of the  yearly  royalty  to  Associated  Corporation-HK by  Associated  Corporation-F  was  a  separate  transaction  and  would not be considered as entered into before the commencement date of the 2018 Amendment (No. 6) Ordinance.

## Example 21

On  31  July  2017,  a  one-year  licensing  agreement  was  signed between Associated Corporation-HK resident in Hong Kong and its ultimate  parent  company,  Associated  Corporation-F  resident  in Jurisdiction-F. According to the agreement, Associated Corporation-F licensed its registered trademark to Associated Corporation-HK,  and  in  return  was  entitled  to  a  royalty  income based  on  a  certain  percentage  of  sales  of  the  branded  goods  of

Corporation-HK to customers in Hong Kong.    Based on the terms in  the  agreement,  the  agreement  would  automatically  be  rolled forward or extended for another year with all the contractual terms unchanged, unless any of the two parties to the agreement notified the other party in writing its intention to terminate the agreement.

Each  payment  of  royalty  was  a  separate  transaction.    Any  royalty paid  in  respect  of  sales  made  after  the  commencement  date  of  the 2018 Amendment (No. 6) Ordinance would not be grandfathered.

## Example 22

Associated Corporation-HK was a corporate treasury center resident in Hong Kong.    For the purpose of funding the acquisition of a land lot by Associated Corporation-F resident in Jurisdiction-F, Associated  Corporation-HK  lent  a  five-year-loan  of  $20  million  to Associated Corporation-F at a flat interest rate of 3.5% under a loan agreement  dated  1  July  2018.    The  loan  was  made  available  to Associated  Corporation-F  through  Associated  Corporation-HK's bank account in Hong Kong.

Scenario 1: The loan was a term loan and the entire amount of $20 million was drawn down by Associated Corporation-F on 1 July 2018.

Scenario  2:  The  loan  was  subject  to  a  condition  precedent  that Associated Corporation-F had executed an equitable charge against the land lot acquired in favour of Associated Corporation-HK.    The condition precedent was satisfied on 31 July 2018 and the loan was drawn down on the same day.

Scenario 3: The loan was a line of credit against which Associated Corporation-F could draw down variable amounts on a need basis as long as the total loan amount did not exceed $20 million.

T he key question is whether the loan transaction was entered into or effected before the commencement date of the Amendment (No. 6) Ordinance. The fact  that  a  loan  agreement  was  signed  before  the commencement date should  not  be  conclusive.    To  decide  on  this question, it is necessary to consider whether the terms and conditions

of the loan were complete, and the rights of the borrower and lender relating to the loan accrued before the commencement date.

## Scenario 1

Since the loan transaction was entered into and effected before the commencement date of the 2018 Amendment (No. 6) Ordinance, it could be grandfathered even though the transaction would still be in effect for four more years after the commencement date of the 2018 Amendment Ordinance.

## Scenario 2

Since the drawdown of the loan was subject to a condition precedent which was satisfied on 31 July 2018, the loan transaction would not be  accepted  as  having  been  entered  into  or  effected  before  the commencement date and the grandfathering provisions would not be applicable.

## Scenario 3

Each  amount  drawn  down  under  the  line  of  credit  would  be considered as a separate loan transaction.    If such a transaction was effected after the commencement date of the 2018 Amendment (No. 6) Ordinance, it would not be grandfathered.

## DETERMINING THE ARM'S LENGTH PRICE

## Key aspects

69. Application of the arm's length principle is based on comparison of the provisions in a controlled transaction with the provisions that would have been had the parties been independent and undertaking a comparable transaction under comparable circumstances.    There are two key aspects in a comparability analysis:
2. (a) identify  the  commercial  or  financial  relations  between  the associated persons and the provisions and economically relevant circumstances attaching to those relations in order that the relevant transaction is accurately delineated;

- (b) compare the provisions and the economically relevant circumstances of the relevant transaction as accurately delineated  with  the  provisions  and  the  economically  relevant circumstances of comparable transactions between independent person.

## Functional analysis

70. The functional analysis assists in assessing the level of comparability present in controlled and uncontrolled transactions and in assessing the relative contributions of the associated persons to those transactions.    It is an analysis of  the  functions  performed,  assets  used  and  risks  assumed  by  associated persons  in  controlled  transactions  and  by  independent  persons  in  comparable uncontrolled transactions.
71. The functional analysis is not a transfer pricing methodology but a tool that assists in the proper assessment of comparability.    It seeks to analyze the functions and risks undertaken by a person whose transfer pricing is at issue, as a basis for identifying potential comparables and determining any differences for which adjustments have to be made to permit valid comparisons. It would be useful in assessing:
3. (a) the availability of comparables in relation to prices or functions;
4. (b) the degree of comparability in respect of the person's uncontrolled transactions or those undertaken by other persons considered as possible comparables; and
5. (c) the  relative  importance  of  the  functions,  assets  and  risks  of each  of  the  associated  persons  to  the  value  added  to  the transactions  in  cases  where  a  transactional  profit  method  is needed.
72. In  complex  or  composite transactions involving distinctive  markets and  product/  service  combinations,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  the  functions, assets and risks separately for each significant combination.    If more than one business strategy is applied, it will become necessary to perform an analysis of

the  functions  performed,  assets  used  and  risks  assumed  for  each  business strategy because the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed vary in each major market.

73. In Asia Master Limited v CIR 7 HKTC 25, the Court of First Instance observed  that  it  was  important  to  examine  the  functions  and  risks  of  the relevant  entities  in  a  transfer  pricing  study.    Thus,  prior  to  undertaking  a search for comparable data, it is crucial that an analysis of functions, risks and assets  (especially  intangibles)  is  undertaken.    The  most  common  process failure is a rush to an analysis of potential comparables in reliance on a familiar business description such as 'limited risk distributor' or 'contract manufacturer'.
74. The economic factors that are critical to the specific transfer pricing issue being addressed must be identified and their impact fully considered.    It might  also  be  useful  to  identify  and  explain  why  certain  factors  are  not considered to be relevant.    It is important that functional analyses are tailored to the situation at hand.

## Comparability analysis

75. Comparability  is  central  to  the  application  of  the  arm's  length principle.    The critical question is whether the uncontrolled transaction which is sought to be compared  against the controlled transaction is indeed comparable. Chevron Australia Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2017]  FCAFC  62  highlights  the  paramount  importance  for  the  inclusion  of robust comparability analysis and transfer pricing analysis.
76. To reconstruct the consideration paid or received under a controlled transaction  so  that  it  represents  what  might  be  expected  if  the  associated persons  had  been  transacting  on  an  arm's  length  basis  under  an  uncontrolled transaction,  it  is  necessary  to  compare  or  benchmark  the  actual  outcome between independent persons that are comparable.    In San Remo Macaroni Co. v  FCT [1999],  43  ATR  53,  the  Australian  High  Court  accepted  that  the Australian  Taxation  Office  had  made  a  bona  fide  attempt  to  reconstruct  or determine  the  arm's  length  price  by  relying  on  customs  information  and comparable sales.

77. The  comparison  of  a  controlled  transaction  with  an  uncontrolled ion or transactions is referred to as a 'comparability analysis'. ed and  uncontrolled  transactions are comparable  if  none  of  the ces  between  the  transactions  could  materially  affect  the  factor  being d  in  the  methodology,  or  if  reasonably  accurate  adjustments  can  be eliminate the material effects of any such differences. transact Controll differen examine made to
2. The  search  for  comparables  should  not  be  separated  from  the bility analysis.

6. Step 2: Broad-based analysis of the taxpayer's circumstances.

## Economically relevant characteristics or comparability factors

81. The  accurate  delineation  of  the  actual  transaction  between  the associated persons requires analysis of the economically relevant characteristics of the transaction.    The economically relevant characteristics or comparability factors that need to be identified in the commercial or financial relations  between  the  associated  persons  in  order  to  accurately  delineate  the actual transaction can be broadly categorized as follows:
2. (a) The contractual terms of the transaction.
3. (b) The functions performed by each of the parties to the transaction, taking into account assets used and risks assumed, including how those functions relate to the wider generation of value by the group to which the parties belong, the circumstances surrounding the transaction, and industry practices.

- (c) The characteristics of property transferred or services provided.
- (d) The economic circumstances of the parties and of the market in which the parties operate.
- (e) The business strategies pursued by the parties.

## Contractual terms of the transaction

82. The contractual terms of an arm's length transaction define explicitly or implicitly the division of responsibilities, obligations and rights, assumption of  identified  risks  and  pricing  arrangement.    When  independent  persons negotiate  contracts  or  agreements,  the  ultimate  price  or  margin  agreed  is influenced by the terms and conditions of the proposed agreement.    Examples of the terms and conditions that may influence the agreed price/ margin include credit and payment terms, volume, duration, product and service liabilities of the parties, warranties and exchange risk.

## Example 23

Corporation-HK sold a product at the same price to an Associated Corporation-F  and  an  independent  third  party  in  Jurisdiction-F. Both Associated Corporation-F and the third party had similar risk profiles.    Associated Corporation-F was given a credit period of 6 months  whereas  the  independent  third  party  was  given  a  credit period 3 months.

Prima facie, the price charged on Associated Corporation-F was not at arm's length.    The volumes of sale (i.e. a possible bulk discount) should also be considered before reaching a conclusion.

## Example 24

Corporation-HK,  a  cosmetic  company,  restructured  its  selling  and marketing activities by entering into an arrangement with a wholly owned non-resident Corporation-F for the sale and marketing of the cosmetic brand in existing and new markets. Under the

arrangement, Corporation-F acquired existing sales contracts concluded  by Corporation-HK,  performed  a  number  of  sales  and marketing  functions and  assumed  the accounts receivable late payment risk for all existing and new cosmetic contracts.    Payment terms with third party customers were for payment in full within 30 days. Corporation-F was contractually required to transfer payment to  Corporation-HK  on  immediate  receipt  from  third  party customers. Corporation-F was sufficiently capitalized to accommodate  late  payment  of  accounts  receivable  and  it  had  the ability to manage and control any exposure of risk.

For Corporation-F's performing the functions and assuming the risk of  late  payment,  Corporation-HK  paid  Corporation-F  a  fee  which was equal to 1% of gross sales.    Assume that, after carrying out a review  on  the  form  and  substance  of  the  commercial  or  financial relations  in  which  the  actual  provisions  operate,  it  was  concluded that  the  conduct  of  the  parties  and  the  economic  effect  of  the transactions  were  consistent  with  the  contractual  terms.    In  such  a case,  the  form  and  commercial  or  financial  arrangement  would  not be disturbed.

83. Where  a  transaction  has  been  formalized  by  the  associated  person through written contractual agreements, those agreements provide the starting point for delineating the transaction between them and how the responsibilities, risks, and anticipated outcomes arising from their interaction were intended to be divided at the time of entering the contract.    However, the written contracts alone  may  not  always  provide  all  the  information  necessary  to  perform  a transfer pricing analysis.    Further information will be required by taking into consideration evidence of the commercial or financial relations provided by the economically  relevant  characteristics  in  the  other  four  categories  described below.

## Example 25

Corporation-F was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Corporation-HK. Corporation-F was located in Jurisdiction-F and acted as agent for Corporation-HK's branded products in the market of Jurisdiction-F.

The  agency  contract  between  Corporation-HK  and  Corporation-F

was silent about any marketing and advertising activities in Jurisdiction-F  that  the  parties  should  perform.    Analysis  of  other economically relevant characteristics and in particular the functions performed,  determines  that  Corporation-F  launched  an  intensive media campaign  in Jurisdiction-F in order to develop brand awareness.    This campaign represented a significant investment for Corporation-F.

Based on evidence provided by the conduct of the parties, it could be concluded that the written contract may not reflect the full extent of the commercial or financial relations between the parties. Accordingly,  the analysis should not be limited by the terms recorded  in  the  written  contract,  but  further  evidence  should  be sought as to the conduct of the parties, including as to the basis upon which Corporation-F undertook the media campaign.

## Functions, assets and risks

84. If the associated persons are transacting on open markets (e.g. quoted markets for securities, commodities or financing), it may only be necessary to conduct a brief  functional  analysis.    In  complex  cases  where  intangibles  are involved,  the  analysis  needs  to  be  more  thorough  and  vigorous.    Particular attention should be paid to the structure and organization of the person.
85. The  compilation  of  lists  of  functions,  assets  and  risks  does  not  in itself  indicate  which  of  the functions  is  the  most  significant,  or  economically the most important to the value added by the business activities of the person. The critical part of the analysis is to ascertain which are the most economically important  functions,  assets  and  risks  and  how  these  might  be  reflected  by  a comparable price, margin or profit on the transactions.
86. While one party may provide a large number of functions relative to that of the other party to the transaction, it is the economic significance of those functions in terms of their frequency, nature, and value to the respective parties to the transaction that is important.

## Example 26

Corporation-HK is a trading company with a portfolio of customers in  Jurisdiction-F .    Whilst  it  had  a  team  of  merchandisers  based  in Hong  Kong,  it  employed  Corporation-F,  an  associated  contract manufacturer located in Country F, to undertake well-defined manufacturing or assembly processes.    Corporation-F did not bear any risks associated with currency, inventory or selling the finished goods.    Corporation-F did not have any valuable intangible assets, such  as  patents,  trademarks  or  designs.    Payment  terms  would  be based on budgets and the contract may include a year-end adjustment to reflect any deviation of actual costs from budget.

Transfer  prices  should  be  set  on  a  cost  plus  basis.    The  mark-ups should reflect the relative low level of risks borne by Corporation-F and take into account the relevant cost such as depreciation costs of the  machinery  and  plant  employed.    These  were  the  opportunity costs of providing the contracted service.

## Example 27

Corporation-HK resident in Hong Kong was a fullfledged distributor in Hong Kong performing the same core activity as a wholesaler and marketer  with  a  developed  risk  profile.    It  performed  value  added activities  such  as  post-sales  services  and  support,  maintaining  the brands and trade names.

The risks assumed and extra functions performed should be considered when seeking third party comparable data because these factors have  a considerable influence on profitability.    Where service  income  can  be  separated  from  sales  revenue,  the  service activities  should be separately rewarded rather than relying on data on  more  integrated  businesses  that  perform  both  sales  and  service functions.

## Characteristics of property transferred or services provided

87. Differences in the specific characteristics of property or services can often  explain  the  differences  in  their  open  market  value.    Comparisons  of these features may be useful in delineating the transaction and in determining the  comparability  of  controlled  and  uncontrolled  transactions.    Focus  should be  put  on  the  attributes  or  characteristics  that  are  valued  by  customers, including the intangible benefits of design, trademark and perceived quality.

## Economic circumstances of the parties and of the market in which the parties operate

88. Arm's  length  prices  or  margins  may  vary  across  different  markets even  for  transactions  involving  the  same  property  or  services.    Achieving comparability requires that:
2. (a) the  markets in which the independent and associated persons operate are comparable; and
3. (b) differences either do not have a material effect on price or can be appropriately adjusted if they do have a material effect.

## Business strategies pursued by the parties

89. Business  strategies  of  a  MNE  group  are  often  formulated  by  the parent company after consultation with and input from group companies, and then put into operation by the relevant group companies.
90. In a transfer pricing context, the question is whether an independent person in similar circumstances might have participated in these strategies and if so what reward it would have expected.
91. Market penetration strategies implement conditions whereby parties to  the  transactions  temporarily  agree  to  forgo  some  profits  or  incur  losses  to position themselves for more substantial profits in the future.
92. If  there  are  costs  incurred  or  profits  forgone  by  a  person  resulting from a strategy or policy, the question to be answered is which person obtains

benefit from these decisions and the attribution of the costs of such a policy or strategy.

93. Independent  persons  will  not  be  prepared  to  accept  strategies  or policies that reduce their level of profit for the benefit of another person.    In arm's  length  transactions,  any  person  accepting  additional  risks  or  functions would demand an appropriate reward.
94. To  prove  that  a  business  strategy  between  associated  persons  is consistent with the arm's length principle, it is necessary to establish whether independent persons dealing at arm's length in fact have, or might be expected to have, accepted the terms and conditions of the strategy in the same or similar market circumstances.

## Example 28

Corporation-HK  was  a  Hong  Kong  distributor  of  a  computer products manufactured by its overseas parent entity. Corporation-HK  had  not  returned  an  assessable  profit  for  many years and claimed that it was pursuing a long-term market penetration strategy.    While the overseas parent entity continued to derive substantial profits, Corporation-HK had to bear all the costs and risks associated with the strategy without additional reward.

Unless the position can be supported by contemporaneous documentation  of  the market penetration strategy, it is highly unlikely that Corporation-HK was pursuing a valid market penetration strategy.

## Global price lists

95. Global price lists  specify  the  prices  at  which  goods  or  services  are sold globally to all purchasers at a particular level of the market.    When used in conjunction with other methodologies, they can be helpful in ascertaining the arm's length price.    A global price list satisfies the arm's length principle only if the prices:
2. (a) have been reviewed using an appropriate arm's length methodology;

- (b) are applied only in comparable circumstances (e.g. where the markets are comparable and the buyers and sellers respectively are performing equivalent functions); and
- (c) are applied to both controlled and uncontrolled transactions.

96. Since  markets  vary  by  location,  it  is  difficult  for  a  global  list  to satisfy these conditions. Isolated sales to  independent  persons  are  not generally sufficient to establish the arm's length nature of a global price list.

## Establishing the reliability of the data

97. Factors influencing reliability include:
2. (a) measurement  error,  arising  from  differences  in  definitions, accounting practice, timing, etc.;
3. (b) departures  from  perfect  market  conditions,  leading  to  some indeterminacy in economic outcomes;
4. (c) unadjusted differences in the circumstances of the transactions involved; and
5. (d) differences in the methodologies used.

98. The most important factor influencing reliability is the way material differences  in  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  transactions  are  dealt  with. Since different methodologies focus attention on differing sets of attributes and questions  raised  by  the  handling  of  material  differences,  reliability  varies between methodologies.

99. The  application  of  multiple  methods  can  be  useful  in  resolving difficult  or  highly  contentious  cases.    Where  two  transfer  pricing  methods give significantly different answers, then either one of the methods is likely to be not appropriate to the facts, rendering the comparative data unreliable and possibly not comparable; or one of the methods has been applied incorrectly.

## TRANSFER PRICING METHODOLOGIES

## The methodologies

100. The  TPG  places  emphasis  on  the  importance  of  comparability analysis and provides detailed descriptions of various transfer pricing methods. The transfer pricing methods comprise the traditional transaction methods (i.e. the comparable uncontrolled price method, the resale price method and the cost plus method) and the transactional profit methods (i.e. the profit split method and the transactional net margin method).
101. Details of various transfer pricing methods are explained in Appendix  2.    A  succinct  account  of  the  traditional  transaction  methods  and transactional profit methods can also be found in Roche Products Pty Limited v FCT , 70 ATR 703.
102. If the traditional transaction methods are not applicable, the transactional  profit  methods  can  be  considered.    Greater  weight  should  be given to evidence provided by price-based methods if this is available.    Where the evidence does not point to a clear conclusion, the OECD recommends that more than one method be used as a way of reaching a satisfactory approximation to the arm's length price.

## Most appropriate method

103. The selection of a transfer pricing method always aims at finding the most appropriate method  for a particular case. Traditional transaction methods are  the  most  direct  means  of  establishing  whether  provisions  in  the commercial and financial relations between associated persons are arm's length. As  a  result,  where,  taking  account  of  the  comparability  analysis  of  the controlled  transaction  under  review  and  of  the  availability  of  information,  a traditional transaction method and a transactional profit method can be applied in an equally reliable manner, the traditional transaction method is preferred to the transactional profit method.
104. Where transactional profit methods are found to be more appropriate than  traditional  transaction  methods  in  consideration  of  the  comparability (including functional) analysis of the controlled transaction under review and

of the evaluation of comparable uncontrolled transactions, a transactional profit method  may  be  applied  either  in  conjunction  with  traditional  transaction methods or on its own.

105. There are situations where transactional profit methods are found to be more appropriate.    For example, profit split should be more appropriate for highly  integrated  operations  where  both  parties  make  unique  and  valuable contributions.

106. The  Commissioner  agrees  that  MNE  groups  should  retain  the freedom  to  apply  methods  not  described  in  the  TPG  (other  methods)  to establish  that  those  prices  satisfy  the  arm's  length  principle.    Such  other methods  should  however  not  be  used  in  substitution  for  OECD-recognized methods where the latter are appropriate to the facts and circumstances of the case.    In  cases  where  other  methods  are  used,  their  selection  should  be supported by documentation including an explanation of why OECD-recognized methods were regarded as non-appropriate or non-workable in  the  circumstances  of  the  case  and  of  the  reason  why  the  selected  other method was regarded as providing a better solution.
107. Difficulties  will  often  be  encountered  if  intellectual  property  rights (IPR)  are  involved.    There  are  a  number  of  ways  (e.g.  cost  method,  market value  method  and  income/  economic  benefit  method)  to  value  the  IPR. However, they all have their limitations and no single method is appropriate in every  case. The  stage  of  development  of  the  IPR,  the  availability  of information and the aim of the valuation all have a bearing on the method used. The selection of the most appropriate transfer pricing method should be based on  a  functional  analysis  that  provides  a  clear  understanding  of  the  group's global  business  processes  and  how  the  transferred  intangibles  interact  with other  functions,  assets  and  risks  that  comprise  the  global  business.    The functional analysis should identify all factors that contribute to value creation, which  may  include  risks  borne,  specific  market  characteristics,  location, business strategies and the group synergies among others.

## COMPARABLES

## Comparables reflecting economic characteristics

108. The best comparables are those that exhibit key economic characteristics closest to the targeted company or transaction.    In Hong Kong, comparables are always very approximate since small samples are used.    The quality of comparable data is more important than the number of comparables identified.
109. Industry data dumps 1 are not acceptable, even if additional statistical analysis  is  provided  using  various  measures  of  central  tendency.    Statistical tools cannot enhance inappropriately selected comparables.
110. The use of statistical tools that do not increase the reliability of the data is not accepted.    For example, the Commissioner does not accept the use of  pooled  ranges  (i.e.  where  the  range  is  constructed  by  treating  each  annual data point of every comparable, as opposed to a single weighted average data point for each comparable as one data point).
111. Controlled data, obtained from transactions between two associated persons,  is  not  accepted.    If  there  are  difficulties  in  obtaining  uncontrolled comparable  data,  it  cannot  be  assumed  that  the  relationship  between  two associated persons has not affected the price or outcomes of a transaction.

## Overseas data

112. The TPG recognize the importance of looking to the market serviced by the tested party when searching for comparables.    If the tested  party is a Hong  Kong  company,  it  normally  makes  sense  to  consider  Hong  Kong comparables only in the first instance. If there are  no  Hong  Kong comparables, or the potential Hong Kong comparable companies put forward are seriously flawed in some way, then it may be necessary to consider using comparables in other jurisdictions.

1 Database dumps generally refers to an extensive automated financial database searches for potential comparables without further analysis the results.

113. Appropriately  selected  overseas  data  is  accepted.    The  same  or similar  market  principle  is  important.    Jurisdictions  recognized  as  Hong Kong's  closest  reference  jurisdictions  in  terms  of  demographics,  size  of economy  and  stage  of  economic  development  would  be  considered.    This means the economic results reflected in the data of such tax jurisdictions are equally  likely  to  be  applicable  to  a  Hong  Kong  person  with  cross-border transaction.

## Databases for benchmarking

114. Commercial databases can be a practical and sometimes cost-effective  way  of  identifying  external  comparables  and  may  provide  the most reliable source of information, depending on the facts and circumstances of  the  case.    However,  a  number  of  limitations  to  commercial  databases  are frequently identified and commercial  databases are not available in all jurisdictions.    The use of commercial databases is not compulsory and it may be possible to identify reliable comparables from other sources of information, including internal comparables, or a manual identification of third parties (such as  competitors)  that  are  regarded  as  potential  sources  of  comparables  for  the controlled transaction.
115. The  Commissioner  does  not  have  any  preference  on  the  databases adopted for benchmarking.    If the comparables are selected from databases to which  the  Department  has  subscribed  (including  Osiris,  Orbis  etc.),  the  data can be cross checked easily and the workings can be verified quickly.    Other commercial databases can be used to search for comparables provided that such databases  are  reliable.    Where  other  commercial  databases  are  used  for benchmarking  purpose,  all  relevant  working  papers  and  data  have  to  be produced to support the calculations.

## Multiple year data

116. Multiple year data will be useful in providing information about the relevant business and product life cycles of the comparables.    Differences in business or product life cycles may have a material effect on transfer pricing provisions that needs to be assessed in determining comparability.    The data from  earlier  years  may  show  whether  the  independent  person  engaged  in  a comparable transaction was affected by comparable economic provisions in a

comparable manner, or whether different provisions in an earlier year materially  affected  its  price  or  profit  so  that  it  should  not  be  used  as  a comparable.

117. Multiple year data is also often useful when applying the transactional net  margin method.    The number of years used to establish the arm's length range should be made reference to the product life cycle instead of business  life  cycle.    Weighted  average  data  for  each  comparable,  computed based  on  the  most  recently  available  3  to  5  years  of  data,  can  typically  be reflective of a normal product life cycle.
118. The use of multiple years of data may be appropriate and beneficial during  comparability  analysis  stage  of  a  transfer  pricing  analysis.    The numeric value (as measured by a relevant profit level indicator) of the financial outcome of a comparable transaction is not relevant to the determination of its comparability.    Rather, the observed outcome of the profit level indicator only becomes  relevant  to  the  analysis  once  the  transaction  has  been  accepted  as comparable.  Multiple  years  of  data  may  be  useful  in  determining  the  impact that  relevant  economic  characteristics  of  a  transaction  have  on  its  degree  of comparability to the controlled transaction under review.    However, statistical tools should not be applied to profit level indicators until after comparability has been established.

## Making adjustments to potential comparables

119. The TPG recognizes that slight differences between companies can be  adjusted  for  on  a  reasonably  accurate  basis.    However,  it  is  unlikely  that significant differences can be taken into account in a meaningful manner.    It is important  not  to  use  unsuitable  comparables  in  the  first  place.    Adjustments should be kept as simple as possible and can only be taken so far before any comparison is rendered meaningless.    Any  exercise  where  the adjustment or series of adjustments significantly alters the range of prices or results is likely to be flawed.

## Arm's length range and the median

120. A  transfer  pricing  report  usually  produces  a  list  of  companies proposed as comparables.    The companies strictly will have differing margins,

finance costs, volume, markets, attitude to risk-taking and so on.    Therefore, after careful analysis, adjustment and filtering out of inappropriate or anomalous  companies,  the  range  can  be  narrowed  to  a  more  realistic  and useable  range.    The  results  are  often  summarized  as  a  range.    If  the  range includes a sizable number of observations, statistical tools that take account of central tendency to narrow the range (e.g. the interquartile range) might help to enhance the reliability of the analysis.

121. In  a  case  where  all  the  comparables  being  used  are  more  or  less equally valid, and there is no reason why the tested party is performing better than those comparable companies, then there is probably nothing wrong with using the interquartile range. The  use  of  statistical tools such  as the interquartile range is to enhance the reliability of a range in which non-quantifiable comparability defects remain as a result of the limitations in available information on the comparables used.    Sometimes, the interquartile range may discard more accurate comparables which fall within the full range but outside the interquartile range.    Hence, it is important to carry out a robust comparability analysis as is reasonably possible in arriving at the arm's length range  from  which  the  interquartile  range  is  derived.    If  the  range  includes  a sizeable  number  of  observations  and  that  the  results  of  the  tested  party  fall within an arm's length range, then no adjustment should be made.
122. Where  the  results  of  the  tested  party  fall  outside  the  range,  the question  arises  as  to  where  within  the  range  its  transfer  prices  should  be adjusted.    Where  the  range  comprises  results  of  relatively  equal  and  high reliability,  it  could  be  argued  that  any  point  in  the  range  satisfies  the  arm's length principle.    In general, it may be appropriate to use measures of central tendency  to  determine  the  adjustment  point  in  order  to  minimize  the  risk  of error  due  to  unknown  or  unquantifiable  remaining  comparability  defects. Normally,  the  median  is  proposed  but  other  points  may  also  be  considered depending  on  the  specific  characteristics  of  the  data  set.    Adjustment  is usually done on a year-by-year basis.

## Capital adjustments

123. Capital  adjustments  are  neither  mandatory  nor  routinely  made. Complex algebra is generally not worth the trouble as the resulting adjustments are  very  minor.    Rather  than  embarking  on  adjustments,  questions  should

really  be  asked  as  to  why  the  tested  party  or  suggested  comparables  have material  deviations  in  working  capital  levels.    Capital  intensity  adjustments are acceptable only if they are expected to increase the reliability of the results.

## Frequency of comparability analyses

124. Taxpayers  are  encouraged  to  review  the  continued  applicability  of comparability analysis each year, particularly bearing in mind any changes in the underlying transactions or business operations.
125. Where  no  significant  changes  are  identified,  and  comparable  data relied  upon  remains  current,  it  will  not  be  necessary  to  complete  a  new comparability analysis.    Comparable data is likely to remain current if there is high degree of confidence that it reflects the current market and business cycle, particularly where an analysis of multiple year data demonstrates low market volatility over time.

## Adjustment be made on a year-by-year basis

126. The aim is to look  at  transfer  pricing  in  one  year  and  not  another. Therefore, adjustment is usually done on a year-by-year basis.

## ADDITIONAL TAX

## Penalty not exceeding the amount of tax undercharged

127. To ensure compliance with Rule 1, an administrative penalty by way of  additional  tax  is  provided  under  section  82A(1D)  and  (1F).    Noting  that transfer  pricing  is  not  an  exact  science  and  having  regard  to  international practices,  the  additional  tax  is  set  at  a  level  lower  than  those  for  other non-compliances under section 82A(1).    Specifically, a person who commits an  offence  is  liable  to  an  additional  tax  not  exceeding  the  amount  of  tax undercharged (vis-à-vis an amount trebling the tax undercharged, as imposed for incorrect return and other matters under section 82A).
128. If an assessment or additional assessment is made on a person under section 50AAF(5), such person is liable to an additional tax pursuant to section

82A(1C) and (1D).    The maximum additional tax is the difference between the amount  of  tax  assessed  on  the  basis  of  the  amount  of  the  person's  incomes under section 50AAF(5) and the amount of tax that would have been assessed if  the  amount of the person's income as stated in the person's tax return had been accepted for the purpose of assessment.

129. If an assessment made on a person for a year of assessment has taken into  account  the  person's  loss  for  an  earlier  year  of  assessment  as  computed under section 50AAF(5), such person is liable to an additional tax pursuant to section  82A(1E)  and  (1F)  for  that  year  of  assessment.    The  maximum additional tax is the difference between the amount of tax assessed taking into account the amount of the person's loss computed under section 50AAF(5) and the amount of tax that would have been assessed if the amount of the person's loss  as  stated  in  the  tax  return  for  the  earlier  year  had  been  accepted  for  the purpose of assessment.

## No penalty if reasonable efforts are proved

130. Section  82A(1G)  provides  that  no  additional  tax  under  section 82A(1D)  and  (1F)  should  be  imposed  on  a  person  who  proves  reasonable efforts have been made to determine the arm's length amount.
131. A reasonable effort means the degree of effort that an independent and competent person engaged in the same line of business or endeavour would exercise under similar circumstances.    What is reasonable is based on what a reasonable business person in the taxpayer's circumstances would do, having regard to the complexity and importance of the transfer pricing issues that arise in that particular case.
132. Taxpayers are considered as not having exercised reasonable effort in the following examples:
4. (a) there  is  no  process  in  place  or  documentation  to  check  the selection or application of transfer pricing methods;
5. (b) there is some contemporaneous documentation but no analysis of functions, assets, risks, market  conditions  or  business strategies;

- (c) there is evidence of limited efforts to develop and implement a transfer pricing setting process but the process is not sufficiently developed or properly implemented having regard to  the  complexity  and  importance  of  the  particular  transfer pricing issues;
- (d) non-arm's length transactions (i.e. controlled transactions) are used as comparables; or
- (e) the  documentation  is  prepared  with  the  use  of  inappropriate statistical  tools  (e.g.  inappropriate  use  of  average  results  of multiple years).

## More stringent penalty

133. The Commissioner would not rule out the possibilities of imposing more stringent penalty or initiating criminal prosecutions if there are apparent violations of the provisions in sections 80 and 82 , or other relevant provisions in  section  82A.    Such  cases  may  involve  not  only  transfer  pricing  issue  but also omission or understatement of income.

## Commercial or Financial Relations

## Relevance of commercial or financial relations

1. As  a  rule,  the  identification  of  the  arm's  length  provision  must  be based  on  the  commercial  or  financial  relations  in  connection  with  which  the actual  provision  operates,  having  regard  to  both  the  form  and  substance  of those relations.
2. The  concept  of  commercial  or  financial  relations  is  broad  and describes  the  totality  of  the  arrangements  between  the  associated  persons. However, the identification of the arm's length provision should be based only on the commercial and financial relations in connection with which the actual provision operates.
3. The actual provision that operates between the associated persons in connection  with  their  commercial  or  financial  relations  refers  to  the  things which ultimately  affect  each  person's  economic  or  financial  positions.    This provision does not need to be explicit contractual terms and can also include the  price  paid  for  the  sale  or  purchase  of  goods  or  services,  the  terms  of  an agreement  that  have  an  economic  impact  on  the  margin  of  profits  earned  by one or both associated persons or a division of profits between them.

## Nexus between actual provision and commercial or financial relations

4. There must be a nexus between the actual provision that operates and the commercial or financial relations between the associated persons.    While provision, directly results from the commercial or financial relations, is clearly within  the  scope  of  the  section  50AAF,  provision  having  a  less  direct  or immediate  connection  should  not  be  excluded.    Accordingly,  cross-border provision arising out of the structures put in place by a multinational enterprise (MNE) group would fall within the scope of section 50AAF since the provision relates to or affects the commercial  or financial relations between  the associated persons and produces a potential tax advantage in relation to Hong Kong tax.
5. The  form  of  the  commercial  or  financial  relations  describes  the features  or  legal  characteristics  of  the  transactions  between  the  associated persons.  This  would  generally  be  evident  from  the  documented  contractual terms  of  transactions,  arrangements  or  other  relations  between  the  associated persons that define explicitly or implicitly how the responsibilities, risks and benefits  are  to  be  divided  between  all  associated  persons.    The  terms  of  a transaction or arrangement may also be found in other correspondence between the associated persons.
6. The substance of the commercial or financial relations between the associated  persons  should  have  to  be  identified,  and  the  actual  transaction should have to be accurately delineated by analyzing the economically relevant characteristics.
7. The transaction between the associated persons can be deduced from written contracts and the conduct of the associated persons. Formal conditions recognized in contracts should have to be clarified and supplemented by analysis of the conduct of the associated persons and the other economically relevant characteristics of the transaction. Where the characteristics of the transaction that are economically significant are inconsistent  with  the  written  contract,  then  the  transaction  will  have  been delineated in accordance with the characteristics of the transaction reflected in the  conduct  of  the  associated  persons.    Contractual  risk  assumption  and conduct with respect to risk assumption will have been examined taking into account  control  over  the  risk  and  the  financial  capacity  to  assume  risk,  and consequently,  risks  assumed  under  the  contract  may  have  been  allocated  in accordance with the conduct of the associated persons and the other facts for analyzing risk in a controlled transaction.    Therefore, the factual substance of the  commercial  or  financial  relations  between  the  persons  and  accurate delineation of the transaction will have to be set out.

## Relations not or not fully documented

8. In some cases, the commercial and financial relations will not have been documented or not fully  documented.    The relevance of such relations will  be  identified  based  on  their  connection  with  the  actual  provision  that operates  between  the  associated  persons.    In  those  cases,  the  form  of  those relations will need to be determined by reference to:

- (a) all the facts and circumstances, including the behaviours of the associated persons in relation to each other;
- (b) the legal and funding structures that have been put in place;
- (c) the roles allocated to the associated persons;
- (d) the transactions or arrangements  that occur within those structures and pursuant to the allocated roles; and
- (e) the economic and financial impacts produced for the relevant associated  persons  by  those  structures,  roles  and  transactions as reflected in their business records.
9. The substance of the commercial or financial relations describes the economic  reality  or  essence  of  those  transactions  and  is  determined  by examining  all  of  the  relevant  facts  and  circumstances,  such  as  the  economic and commercial context of the commercial or financial relations, the object and economic and financial effects of those relations from a practical and business point of view on each of the associated persons and the conduct of the persons, including  the  functions  performed,  assets  used  and  risks  assumed  by  them. Hence, the actual structure, appearance and characterization of the commercial or financial relations, including the legal rights and obligations created, are not decisive  in  the  identification  of  the  arm's  length  provision  under  section 50AAF(1).
10. In most cases, it is expected that the identification of the arm's length provision  will  be  able  to  be  accomplished  by  determining  the  arm's  length contribution made by the operations undertaken in Hong Kong based upon the form and substance of the commercial or financial relations in connection with which  the  actual  provision  operates.    This  is  because  it  is  expected  that associated persons will formalize their economic and commercial objectives in preparing  their  business  and  commercial  contracts  and  legal  agreements,  to reflect the economic and commercial effect of their transactions or arrangements.    It would be exceptional for independent persons dealing with each other at arm's length to do otherwise.

11. If  associated  persons  structure  and  characterize  their  cross-border commercial or financial relations in a manner such that their form is consistent with their substance as explained above, then section 50AAF(1) will not apply. Further,  if  associated  persons  enter  into  cross-border  commercial  or  financial relations  compelled  or  encouraged  by  business  or  regulatory  realities,  that would  be  entered  into  by  independent  persons  dealing  wholly  independently with one another in comparable circumstances then, equally, section 50AAF(1) should not apply.
12. Where reliable data show that comparable uncontrolled transactions exist,  it  cannot  be  argued  that  such  transactions  between  associated  persons would  lack commercial rationality. The  existence of comparable data evidencing arm's length pricing  for  a  transaction  between  associated  persons demonstrates  that  it  is  commercially  rational  for  independent  persons  in comparable circumstances.
13. On  the  other  hand,  if  the  cross-border  commercial  or  financial relations create legal rights or obligations which would not be created, and/ or give rise to transactions or arrangements which would not be implemented, by independent  persons  dealing  at  arm's  length,  then  in  these  circumstances section 50AAF(1) may apply.

## Relations inconsistent with substance of those relations

14. Section 50AAF(1) in effect permits the form of the commercial and financial relations to be disregarded to the extent that it is inconsistent with the substance  of  those  relations.    Substance  is  more  than  mere  legal  substance. It  is  determined  by  examining all of the facts and circumstances, such as the economic and commercial context of the transaction or arrangement, its object and effect from a practical and business point of view, and the conduct of the associated  persons,  including  the  functions  performed,  assets  used  and  risks assumed by them.
15. The  effect  is  that  some  aspects  of  the  commercial  or  financial relations are re-characterized or disregarded and the identification of the arm's length  provision  is  based  only  on  the  modified  commercial  or  financial relations that fully and accurately reflect the substance of those relations.

16. Whether  the  form  and  substance  of  the  commercial  or  financial relations  are  inconsistent  will  be  a  question  of  facts  having  regard  to  all relevant factors, including the structure adopted by the associated persons, the conduct  of  the  associated  persons,  their  characterization  of  the  relations,  the legal rights and obligations created, any flows of funds between the associated persons (including circular flows), the overall economic consequences (including  exposure  to  economic  risks  and  rewards  and  actual  transfers  of wealth)  and  their  effects  on  the  net  economic  positions  of  the  associated persons.    Section  50AAF  is  directed  to  those  cases  where  the  inconsistency between form and substance would cause a distorted outcome in the identification of the arm's length provision.
17. Where  the  substance  of  the  commercial  or  financial  relations  is inconsistent  with  the  form  of  those  relations,  the  form  of  the  commercial  or financial relations adopted by the associated persons must be disregarded to the extent that it is inconsistent with the substance of those relations.    There is no discretion provided by section 50AAF.    The effect is that the economic reality and essence of the commercial or financial relations adopted by the associated persons  is  ultimately  relevant  and  decisive  in  the  identification  of  the  arm's length provision.

## Relations of independent persons would have differed

18. Where it can be concluded that independent persons dealing wholly independently with one another in comparable circumstances would not have entered  into  the  commercial  or  financial  relations  adopted  by  the  associated persons but would have entered into other relations which differ in substance from the commercial or financial relations adopted by the associated persons, the identification of the arm's length provisions must be based on those other commercial or financial relations that independent persons would instead have entered into.
19. The requirement that independent persons would have entered into other commercial or financial relations must be satisfied and it is not of itself sufficient  to  propose  that  independent  persons  might  have  dealt  with  one another  in  an  alternative  manner.    This  does  not  mean  that  third  party transactions or arrangements that exactly replicate those other relations must be identified.    Where  exact  real  world  comparables  are  unavailable,  it  will  be

sufficient to identify what independent persons would have done by reference to alternatively structured transactions or arrangements that most closely reflect the  substance  of  the  relations,  provided  appropriate  adjustments  for  any material differences can reliably be made.

20. Even if the other commercial or financial relations differ in substance from the commercial or financial relations adopted by the associated persons, it does  not mean  they  must  be  entirely  different. The  other commercial  or  financial  relations  acceptable  to  independent  persons  dealing wholly independently with one another could both retain and reject elements of the relations and would include any additional elements on which independent persons would insist.
21. The  relevant question is whether  the commercial  or financial relations adopted by the associated persons differ from those which would have been adopted by independent persons dealing wholly independently with one another in comparable circumstances, having regard to their own  best commercial and economic interests  and  the  arm's  length  options  realistically available to them.
22. Whether these inferences can be drawn will depend on the facts and circumstances  having  regard  to  all  relevant  factors,  including  comparability analysis,  whether  there  is  reliable  evidence  that  comparable  uncontrolled transactions exist or that other transfer pricing methods support the commercial or  financial  relations  adopted  by  the  associated  persons  and  whether  those relations  make  commercial  sense  for  independent  persons  in  all  of  the circumstances of the dealings.
23. Where  the  commercial  or  financial  relations  undertaken  by  the associated persons are disregarded to the extent they differ from the relations that would be adopted by independent persons, the identification of the arm's length provision must be based on the other commercial or financial relations. This is to reflect what independent persons acting in a commercially rational manner would have done had the commercial or financial relations adopted by the  associated  persons  been  structured  in  accordance  with  the  economic  and commercial reality of independent persons dealing at arm's length.

## Relations into which independent persons would not have entered

24. Where it can be concluded that independent persons dealing wholly independently with one another in comparable circumstances would not have entered  into  any  commercial  or  financial  relations,  the  identification  of  the arm's  length  provision  is  to  be  based  on  the  absence  of  the  commercial  or financial  relations  and  on  the  premise  that  independent  persons  would  have maintained their existing positions and done nothing in the circumstances.
25. Whether  these  inferences  can  be  drawn  will  be  a  matter  of  fact having regard to all relevant factors, including comparability analysis, whether the commercial  or  financial relations of the associated persons can be re-characterized  to  conform  with  what  independent  persons  dealing  wholly independently with one another would have  done, the availability  of  reliable evidence concerning comparable  uncontrolled transactions and/ or other transfer  pricing  methods,  and  whether,  having  regard  to  their  own  economic interests, independent persons dealing wholly independently with one another would have entered into the commercial or financial relations.
26. Where  the  commercial  or  financial  relations  of the associated persons  are  disregarded  for  the  purposes  of  identifying  the  arm's  length provision, the arm's length provision is to be identified based on the conclusion that  independent  persons  dealing  wholly  independently  with  one  another  in comparable  circumstances  would  not  have  entered  into  any  commercial  or financial relations where this provision is made or imposed between them.

## Example 1.1

Corporation-HK resident in Hong Kong carried on a manufacturing business that involved holding substantial inventory and a significant investment  in  plant  and  machinery.    It  owned  commercial  property situated in an area prone to increasingly frequent flooding in recent years. Third-party insurers experienced significant uncertainty over the exposure to large claims, with the result that there was no active market for the  insurance of properties in the area.    Associated Corporation-F resident in Jurisdiction-F , provided insurance to Corporation-HK, and an annual premium representing 80% of the value of the inventory, property and contents was paid by Corporation-HK.

Corporation-HK had entered into a commercially irrational transaction  since  there  was  no  market  for  insurance  given  the likelihood of significant claims, and either relocation or not insuring might be more attractive realistic alternatives.    Since the transaction was commercially irrational, there was not a price that was acceptable  to  both  Corporation-HK  and  Associated  Corporation-F from their individual perspectives.

The transaction should not be recognized.    Corporation-HK should be treated as not purchasing insurance and its profits are not reduced by the payment to Associated Corporation-F. Associated Corporation-F should be treated as not issuing insurance.

## Transfer Pricing Methods

## Comparable uncontrolled price method

1. Though  no  absolute  hierarchy  exists  within  the OECD  Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (the TPG), traditional transaction methods are regarded as the most direct way of establishing  whether  provisions  between  associated  persons  are  arm's  length. Where taking account of the comparability analysis of the controlled transaction under review and of the availability of information, the comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method and another transfer pricing method can be applied in an equally reliable way, the CUP method should be preferred.
2. The  CUP  method  compares  the  price  charged  for  property  or services transferred in a controlled transaction to the price charged for property or services transferred in a comparable uncontrolled transaction in comparable circumstances. An uncontrolled price is the price agreed between unconnected persons for the transfer of goods or services.    If the transfer is in all material respects comparable to the transfer between associated persons, the price becomes a comparable uncontrolled price.
3. Strictly, there are two possible types of comparison:
4. (a) internal comparable uncontrolled price where the price to the controlled  transaction  is  compared  to  the  price  charged  in  a comparable  transaction  between  one  of  the  persons  to  the transaction and an independent person;
5. (b) external comparable uncontrolled price where the price to the controlled transaction is compared to the price of a comparable transaction between two independent persons.

The use of an internal comparable uncontrolled price is preferred as, all other things being equal, the circumstances of the controlled transaction are likely to mirror more closely those of the uncontrolled transaction.

## Example 2.1

Corporation-HK  resident  in  Hong  Kong  manufactured  a  precision cutting machine which it sold at a price of $1 million to a subsidiary Corporation-F  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F  but  at  a  price  of  $1.2 million to an independent corporation in Jurisdiction-F.

Application of the internal comparable uncontrolled price should be straightforward.    The  method  directly  and  reliably  reflected  the arm's length price.    Assuming all factors of comparability such as contractual terms were the same, an amount of $0.2 million should be added to Corporation-HK's assessable profits.

## Example 2.2

Corporation-HK  resident  in  Hong  Kong  was  trading  in  listed securities.    It held listed securities which worth $20 million on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.    It sold the listed securities to a wholly owned subsidiary Corporation-F resident in Jurisdiction F for $10 million.

Application of the external comparable uncontrolled price would be appropriate because it reliably reflected the arm's length price.    A sum of $10 million (i.e. $20 million - $10 million) should be added to Corporation-HK's assessable profits.

4. Reliable  application  of  the  CUP  method  requires  that  there  are  no differences in the transactions being compared or that the effect on price of any differences  that  do  exist  can  be  accurately  accounted  for  by  way  of  an adjustment. An  uncontrolled transaction is comparable  to a controlled transaction if:
2. (a) none of the differences (if any) between the transactions being compared or between the persons undertaking those

- transactions  could  materially  affect  the  price  in  the  open market, or
- (b) reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the material effects of such differences.
5. The  CUP  method  is  a  particularly reliable  method  where  an independent person sells the same product as is sold between two associated persons.    If  the  products  sold  under  controlled  and  uncontrolled  transactions are  different,  it  would  be  appropriate  to  inquire  whether  the  difference  has  a material effect on the price.    If this difference does have a material effect on price, some adjustments would be appropriate.
6. In considering whether controlled and uncontrolled transactions are comparable, regard should also be had to the effect on price of the comparability factors other than just product comparability.
7. Situations  where  it  is  most  appropriate  to  apply  the  CUP  method include:
- (a) interest rate charged on an inter-company borrowing between associated persons;
- (b) royalties charged on licensed intangible properties (e.g. trademark, design, copyright, etc.); and
- (c) price charged for the sale of listed securities.
8. If no comparable can be found, other traditional transaction methods (i.e.  cost  plus  and  resale  price  methods)  will  have  to  be  used.    The  main difference  between  the  CUP  method  and  the  other  traditional  transaction methods,  is  that  the  former  compares  the  consideration  for  a  comparable product  or  service  in  comparable  circumstances  whereas  the  cost  plus  and resale price methods seek to compute the margin the person might be expected to achieve in light of functions performed, assets used and risks assumed.

## Cost plus method

9. The  cost  plus  method  uses  the  costs  incurred  by  the  supplier  of property  or  services  in  a  controlled  transaction.    An  appropriate  cost  plus mark-up  is  added  to  this  cost,  to  make  an  appropriate  profit  in  light  of  the functions performed taking into account assets used and risks assumed and the market conditions.    What is arrived at after adding the cost plus  mark-up to the  above  costs  may  be  regarded  as  an  arm's  length  price  of  the  controlled transaction.
10. The  cost  plus  method  will  use  margins  computed  after  direct  and indirect  costs  of  production,  while  a  net  margin  method  will  use  margins computed after operating expenses of the person as well.
11. Under  the  cost  plus  method,  the  mark-up  should  be  calculated  by reference  to  comparable  transactions.    The  comparability  of  transactions  is important and adjustments are required to account for product differences.    An uncontrolled transaction is comparable to a controlled transaction if:
4. (a) none of the differences (if any) between the transactions being compared or between the persons undertaking those transactions  could  materially  affect  the  cost  plus  mark  up  in the open market; or
5. (b) reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the material effects of such differences.
12. Ideally,  the  mark-up  of  the  seller  person  should  be  determined  by reference to mark-ups on similar items sold at arm's length by the same seller person  or  by  comparable  vendors.    The  mark-up  should  provide  the  person with  an  appropriate  profit  in  view  of  the  functions  performed,  taking  into account assets used, risks assumed and the market conditions.
13. Whilst the level of the profit margin (i.e. the mark-up) is critical, it would be wrong not to give careful consideration to the level and type of costs to  which  the  margin  should  be  applied.    This  is  particularly  important  when looking  for  comparable,  which  may  classify  costs  in  different  ways  in  their accounts  (i.e.  some  at  operating  expense  level  while  some  at  gross  margin

- level).    Further, different types of costs may mean that different functions are being  carried  out  and  therefore  may  imply  that  the  persons  being  compared were not comparable.
14. It  is  important  to  consider  differences  in  the  level  and  types  of expenses (i.e. operating expenses and non-operating expenses including financing  expenditures)  associated  with  functions  performed,  assets  used  and risks assumed by the persons or transactions being compared.    Consideration of these differences may indicate the following:
- (a) if  the  expenses  reflect  a  functional  difference  (taking  into account  assets  used  and  risks  assumed)  which  has  not  been taken  into  account  in  applying  the  method,  an  adjustment  to the cost plus mark-up may be required;
- (b) if  the  expenses  reflect  additional  functions  that  are  distinct from the activities tested by the method, separate compensation for those functions may need to be determined. Such  functions  may  amount  to  the  provision  of  services  for which an appropriate reward may be determined.    Similarly, expenses  that  are  the  result  of  capital  structures  reflecting non-arm's length arrangements may require separate adjustment;
- (c) if  differences  in  the  expenses  of  the  persons  being  compared merely reflect efficiencies or inefficiencies of the persons, as would  normally  be  the  case  for  supervisory,  general,  and administrative  expenses,  then  no  adjustment  to  the  gross margin may be appropriate.
15. The cost plus method  is particularly useful in the following transactions:
- (a) sale of semi-finished goods between associated persons;
- (b) conclusion of joint facility agreements or long term buy-and-supply arrangements between associated persons; and

## (c) provision of service.

## Example 2.3

Corporation-HK1 resident in Hong Kong was a corporation specializing in the production of printed circuit boards for a wholly owned subsidiary Corporation-F resident in Jurisdiction-F. Corporation-HK1 would be provided with all the technical know-how used in the manufacturing of the printed circuit boards.

Corporation-HK2  was  an  independent  contract  manufacturer  of printed  circuit  boards  in  Hong  Kong  and  was  identified  as  an external comparable enterprise. Corporation-HK2 sold the products to an independent distributor in Jurisdiction-F and charged an average mark-up of 10 percent.

Assume Corporation-HK1 incurred direct and indirect costs of $200 in producing one unit, the arm's length mark-up would be $20 (i.e. $200 × 10%).

## Example 2.4

Corporation-HK1  resident  in  Hong  Kong  was  a  manufacturer  of timing mechanisms for mass-market clocks.    It sold these products to its wholly owned subsidiary Corporation-F resident in Jurisdiction  F.    Corporation-HK1  earned  a  5  percent  gross  profit mark-up with respect to its manufacturing operation.

Corporation-HK2,  Corporation-HK3  and  Corporation-HK4  were independent domestic manufacturers  of timing  mechanisms  for mass-market  watches.    Corporation-HK2,  Corporation-HK3  and Corporation-HK4 sold their products to unrelated foreign purchasers  and  earned  gross  profit  mark-ups  with  respect  to  their manufacturing operations that ranged from 3 to 5 percent.

Corporation-HK1 accounted for supervisory, general, and administrative costs as operating expenses, and thus these costs were not  reflected  in  cost  of  goods  sold.    The  gross  profit  mark-ups  of

Corporation-HK2, Corporation-HK3 and Corporation-HK4, however, reflected supervisory, general, and administrative costs as part of costs of goods sold.

If  the  cost  plus  method  was  used,  the  gross  profit  mark-ups  of Corporation-HK2,  Corporation-HK3  and  Corporation-HK4  should be adjusted to provide accounting consistency.    Adjustment would also be required to account for product difference, if any.

## Example 2.5

Corporation-F  resident in Jurisdiction-F was  a  wholly  owned subsidiary  of  Corporation-HK resident in Hong Kong.    Compared with Hong Kong, wages were relatively lower in Jurisdiction-F.    At the expense  and  risk of Corporation-HK,  television sets  were assembled by Corporation-F. All the necessary components, know-how,  etc.  were  provided  by  Corporation-HK.    The  purchase of  the  assembled  product  was  guaranteed  by  Corporation-HK  in case  the  television  sets  failed  to  meet  a  certain  quality  standard. After  the  quality  check,  the  television  sets  were  brought  -  at  the expense  and  risk  of  Corporation-HK  -  to  distribution  centres  of Corporation-HK in several countries.

The function of Corporation-F  could  be  described  as  a  purely  cost manufacturing function.    The risks Corporation-F would bear were the  eventual  differences  in  agreed  quality  and  quantity.    The  cost base  for  applying  the  cost  plus  method  could  be  computed  by aggregating all the costs connected to the assembling activities.

## Example 2.6

Corporation-F resident in Jurisdiction-F carried out contract research for its wholly owned subsidiary Corporation-HK resident in Hong  Kong.    All  risks  of  a  failure  of  the  research  were  born  by Corporation-HK,  which  also  owned  all  the  intangibles  developed through  the  research  and  therefore  also  had  the  profit  chances resulting from the research.

This was a typical setup for applying a cost plus method.    All costs for the research, which the related parties have agreed upon, had to be compensated.    The level of cost plus mark-up should reflect how innovative and complex the research was carried out.

## Resale price method

16. The resale price method is based on the price at which a product that has  been  purchased  from  an  associated  person  is  resold  to  an  independent person. This resale price is reduced by the appropriate price  margin representing  the  amount  out  of  which  the  reseller  would  seek  to  cover  its selling and  other  operating  expenses  and,  in  the  light of the  functions performed  (taking  into  account  assets  used  and  risks  assumed),  make  an appropriate profit.    What is left after subtracting the resale price margin can be regarded as, after adjustment for other costs associated with the purchase of the product (e.g. customs duties), an arm's length price of the previous transfer of property between the associated persons.
17. If  a  person  performs  all  the  functions  an  independent  distributor might  be  expected  to  perform,  the  resale  price  method  can  be  particularly suitable.    If  a  person  is  performing  part  of  a  manufacturing  process,  for example primary manufacture, and is not the owner of valuable intangibles, or is  providing  some  limited  services  which  support  the  group's  core  activity while not itself being pivotal to the earning of profits, then the cost plus method would be more appropriate.
18. The  resale  price  method  will  be  most  useful  where  the  reseller contributes  little  to  the  value  of  the  product  ultimately  on-sold  on  an  arm's length basis.    The method will be most reliable if the reseller on-sells within a short  time  because  more  time  that  lapses,  the  greater  the  risks  assumed  in relation  to  changes  in  the  market,  in  rates  of  exchanges,  etc.  in  which  such factors need to be taken into account in any comparison.
19. The resale price margin represents the amount out of which a reseller would seek to cover its selling and other operating expenses and in the light of the  functions  performed  taking  into  account  assets  used  and  risks  assumed, make an appropriate profit.    The resale price margin should be calculated by reference to the margin in comparable transactions.

20. An uncontrolled transaction is comparable to a controlled transaction
2. if:
3. (a) none of the differences (if any) between the transactions being compared or between the persons undertaking those transactions could materially affect the resale price margin in the open market; or
4. (b) reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the material effects of such differences.

In  making  comparisons  for  purposes  of  the  resale  price  method,  fewer adjustments are normally needed to account for product differences than under the CUP method, because minor product differences are less likely to have as material an effect on profit margins as they do on price.

21. The resale price margin is expected to vary according to the amount of  value  added  by  the  reseller.    Different  situations  can  occur  where  the combination of functions, assets and risks add value to the product.    This level of activities can range widely from the case where the reseller performs only minimal services as a forwarding agent to the case where the reseller takes on the full risk of ownership together with the full responsibility for and the risks involved  in  advertising,  marketing,  distributing  and  guaranteeing  the  goods, financing stocks and other connected services.    The appropriate resale profit margin  should  increase  with  increased  assets,  functions  and  risks.    If  the reseller incurs a significant amount of marketing expenditure for the promotion of  a  trademark  that  is  owned  by  an  associated  person  and  risks  its  own resources in these activities, the reseller would be entitled to a commensurately higher expected return than an agent.    This can be illustrated as follows:
2. (a) if the reseller performs limited services as a forwarding agent or broker, the comparable resale profit margin can be derived from an examination of commission or brokerage fees;
3. (b) if the reseller takes property in  the  goods,  assumes  the business risks, warehouses and distributes them to customers, the  resale  profit  margin  applicable  to  a  principal  would  be relevant;

- (c) if the reseller, in addition to the functions and risks in (b), also undertakes marketing, education and other activities, assumes warranty and other risks and employs intangible assets such as a  developed  distribution  network,  the  additional  functions performed, risks assumed and intangibles used should result in higher returns.
22. If the reseller in its activities employs certain assets (e.g. intangibles used by the reseller, such as its marketing organization), it may be inappropriate to evaluate the arm's length provisions in the controlled transaction using an unadjusted resale price margin derived from uncontrolled transactions in which the uncontrolled reseller does not employ similar assets. If the reseller possesses valuable marketing intangibles, the resale price margin in  the  uncontrolled  transaction  may  underestimate  the  profit  to  which  the reseller in the controlled transaction is entitled, unless the comparable uncontrolled transaction involves the same reseller or a reseller with similarly valuable marketing intangibles.
23. Where  the  reseller  has  the  exclusive  right  to  resell  the  goods,  the appropriate resale price margin is influenced by such matters as:
- (a) size of the geographical market and the existence and relative competitiveness of possible substitute goods;
- (b) level  of  activity  undertaken  by  the  reseller  (e.g.  substantial resources are committed  to  marketing  the  property or a monopolistic turnover is realized without much effort); and
- (c) risks  associated  with  having  the  only  source  of  supply  and being tied to the other enterprise's  product  development cycles.

## Example 2.7

Corporation-HK1  resident  in  Hong  Kong  purchased  fashion  and apparel  from  Parent  Corporation-F  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F  and sold them through various retail outlets in Hong Kong.

Corporation-HK2, an independent distributor in Hong Kong, purchased similar products from various suppliers in the Far East, sold the same to end customers and earned an average gross margin of 40 percent.

Assume Corporation-HK1 sold a particular line of women's apparel it purchased from Parent Corporation-F and derived sale proceeds of $200  million.    The  arm's  length  price  for  this  line  of  apparel  it purchased from the parent corporation should be $120 million (i.e. $200 million × (1 - 40%)).

## Example 2.8

Two  distribution  corporations  were  selling  the  same  product  in Hong Kong under the same brand name.    Corporation-HK1 offered a warranty whereas Corporation-HK2 offered none. Corporation-HK1  was  including  the  warranty  as  part  of  a  pricing strategy  and  so  sold  its  product  at  a  higher  price  resulting  in  a higher  gross  profit  margin  (if  the  costs  of  servicing  the  warranty were not taken into account) than that of Corporation-HK2, which sold at a lower price.

The  two  margins  would  not  be  comparable  without  an  adjustment made to account for that difference.

## Example 2.9

Assume that a warranty was offered with respect to all products so that the downstream price was uniform. Corporation-HK1 performed  the  warranty  function  but  was,  in  fact,  compensated  by the  supplier  through  a  lower  price.    Corporation-HK2  did  not perform the warranty function which was performed by the supplier (i.e. products were sent back to the factory).    However, the supplier charged Corporation-HK2 a higher price than that was charged to Corporation-HK1.

- If Corporation-HK1  accounted  for  the  cost of performing  the warranty function as a cost of goods sold, then the adjustment in the gross profit margins for the differences would be automatic.    If the warranty expenses were accounted for as operating expenses, there would  be  a  distortion  in  the  margins  which  should  be  corrected. The  reasoning  in  this  case  would  be  that,  if  Corporation-HK2 performed the warranty itself, its supplier would reduce the transfer price,  and  therefore,  Corporation-HK2's  gross  profit  margin  would be greater.

## Profit split method

Most appropriate for complex cases

24. The profit split method may be the most appropriate method in the presence of one or more of the following indicators:
2. (a) each party makes unique and valuable contributions;
3. (b) the  business  operations  are  highly  integrated  such  that  the contributions  of  the  parties  cannot  be  reliably  evaluated  in isolation from each other;
4. (c) the  parties  share  the  assumption  of  economically  significant risks, or separately assume closely related risks.

25. Contributions will be 'unique and valuable' in cases where they are not  comparable  to  contributions  made  by  uncontrolled  parties  in  comparable circumstances, and they represent a key source of actual or potential economic benefits  in  the  business  operations.    Where  each  party  to  the  transaction legally owns unique and valuable intangibles that are relevant to the transaction, it will also be necessary to consider whether, under the accurate delineation of the transaction, they each assume the economically significant risks relating to those intangibles (e.g. risks related to development, obsolescence, infringement, product liability and exploitation).
26. The profit split method identifies the relevant profits to be split for the associated persons from a controlled transaction (or controlled transactions that  it  is  appropriate  to  aggregate)  and  then  splits  those  profits  between  the associated persons based on an economically valid basis that approximates the division of profits that would have been agreed at arm's length.    Reference to 'profits'  should  generally  be  taken  as  applying  equally  to  losses.    The relevant profits or losses must be derived from the most narrowly identifiable business activity, including the controlled transaction or transactions, for which data are available.
27. While the traditional price-based methods might continue to work in circumstances  where  the  functions  of  group  members  are  inter-related,  there are situations when group functions are so intertwined that the most appropriate way is to examine the whole process from initial manufacture to end sale and work out the real economic contribution made by each enterprise by way of a functional  analysis.    In DSG Retail  Ltd  and  others  v  Revenue  and  Customs Commissioners [2009] STC (SCD) 397, which related to a captive insurance arrangement, the profit split  method was preferred and the CUP  method was rejected.
28. If the final prices of goods do not just reflect the cost of manufacture but  initial  research,  innovative  technology  and  sophisticated  marketing  and promotion and the functions are spread among group members, all of whom are adding value, operating in various tax jurisdictions, it is difficult to compute the price  at  which  the  goods,  in  different  states  of  incompleteness  at  different points in the process, would have been passed between independent persons.

29. After the functional analysis has been carried out to identify the real economic contribution made by each person to the process, the next step is to allocate  to  each  person  the  share  of  profit  or  loss  which  it  would  have anticipated at the time the relevant arrangements were set up.

## Profit to be split

30. The  profit  may  be  the  aggregate  profit  from  the  transactions  or  a residual profit intended to represent the profit that cannot readily be assigned to one of the persons.    Factors to be taken into account in undertaking a profit split include:
2. (a) whether  the  profit  split  is  to  be  undertaken  on  a  particular product line, an aggregation of products or a whole of entity basis;
3. (b) whether it is necessary to identify the persons in relation to the transaction  and  the  profits  of  each  person  so  as  to  determine the profits to be split among them if the person transacted with more than one associated person;
4. (c) whether the accounts of the associated persons need to be put on a common basis as to accounting practice and currency and then consolidated in order for the relevant profit to be determined.
31. In general, the determination of the relevant profits to be split and of the profit splitting factors should:
6. (a) be  consistent  with  the  functional  analysis  of  the  controlled transaction under review, and in particular reflect the assumption of the economically significant risks by the parties; and
7. (b) be capable of being measured in a reliable manner.

## Actual or anticipated profits

32. Where the profit split method is found to be the most appropriate, the splitting of actual profits (i.e. profits which have been affected by the playing out  of  economically  significant  risks)  would  only  be  appropriate  where  the accurate  delineation  of  the  transaction  shows  that  the  parties  either  share  the assumption  of  the  same  economically  significant  risks  associated  with  the business opportunity or separately assume  closely related, economically significant  risks  associated  with  the  business  opportunity  and  consequently should share in the resulting profits or losses.
33. Alternatively,  if  the  profit  split  method  is  found  to  be  the  most appropriate  method  (e.g.  because  each  party  to  the  transaction  makes  unique and  valuable  contributions)  but  one  of  the  parties  does  not  share  in  the assumption  of  the  economically  significant  risks  which  might  play  out  after entering  into  the  transaction,  a  split  of  anticipated  profits  would  be  more appropriate.
34. Irrespective  of  whether  a  transactional  profit  split  of  anticipated  or actual  profits  is  used,  unless  there  are  major  unforeseen  developments  which would  have  resulted  in  a  renegotiation  of  the  agreement  had  it  occurred between independent parties, the basis upon which those profits are to be split between the associated persons, including the profit splitting factors, the way in which  relevant  profits  are  calculated,  and  any  adjustments  or  contingencies, must be determined on the basis of information known  or  reasonably foreseeable by the parties at the time the transactions were entered into.

## Criteria or factors for profit splitting

35. The  relevance  of  comparable  uncontrolled  transactions  or  internal data  and  the  criteria  used  to  achieve  an  arm's  length  division  of  the  profits depend  on  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case.    The  criteria  or  splitting factors used to split the profit should:
2. (a) be  independent  of  transfer  pricing  policy  formulation  and  be based on objective data (e.g. sales to independent parties), not on data relating to the remuneration of controlled transactions (e.g. sales to associated persons);

- (b) be verifiable; and
- (c) be supported by comparables data, internal data, or both.

## Profit splitting factors

36. Asset-based  or  capital-based  profit  splitting  factors  can  be  used where there  is  a  strong  correlation  between  tangible  assets  or  intangibles,  or capital  employed  and  creation  of  value  in  the  context  of  the  controlled transaction.    In order for a profit splitting factor to be meaningful, it should be applied  consistently  to  all  the  parties  to  the  transaction.    A  profit  splitting factor based on expenses may be appropriate where it is possible to identify a strong correlation between  relative expenses  incurred  and  relative value contributed.    However, if each party contributes different valuable intangibles, then  it  is  not  appropriate  to  use  a  cost-based  factor  unless  cost  is  a  reliable measure of the relative value of those intangibles or costs can be risk-weighted to achieve a reliable measure of relative value.

## Contribution analysis

37. Under a contribution analysis, the relevant profits, which are the total profits from the controlled transactions under examination, are divided between the associated persons in order to arrive at a reasonable approximation of the division  that  independent  persons  would  have  achieved  from  engaging  in comparable transactions.    This division can be supported by comparable data where  available.    Making  this  decision  requires  careful  judgement  and  the criteria should always include a firm understanding of the overall trade and of what adds value to it.

## Residual analysis

38. Where  the  contributions  of  the  parties  are  such  that  some  can  be reliably  valued  by  reference  to  a  one-sided  method  and  benchmarked  using comparables while others cannot, the application of a residual analysis may be appropriate. A  residual analysis divides the relevant profits from the controlled transactions under examination into two categories.

39. In  the  first  category  are  profits  attributable  to  contributions  which can  be  reliably  benchmarked:  typically  less  complex  contributions  for  which reliable comparables can be found.    Ordinarily this initial remuneration would be  determined  by  applying  one  of  the  traditional  transaction  methods  or  a transactional  net  margin  method  to  identify  the  remuneration  of  comparable transactions  between  independent  persons.    Thus,  it  would  generally  not account  for  the  return  that  would  be  generated  by  a  second  category  of contributions which may be unique and valuable, and/ or are attributable to a high level of integration or the shared assumption of economically significant risks.    Typically, the  allocation  of any residual profit or loss remaining after allowing for the profits attributable to the first category of contributions would be  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  relative  value  of  the  second  category  of contributions by the parties, supplemented where possible by external market data  that  indicate  how  independent  persons  would  have  divided  profits  in similar circumstances.
40. For  each  category,  it  is  necessary  to  have  regard  to  the  relevant functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by each party.    Where a particular function, asset or risk is relevant to both categories, it is important to apportion the relevant contribution between the two categories in order to avoid double counting.

## Example 2.10

Corporation-HK  and  Corporation-F  were  associated  enterprises resident  in  Hong  Kong  and  Jurisdiction-F  respectively. Both manufactured  the  same  widgets  and  incurred  expenditure  that resulted  in  the  creation  of  a  unique  and  valuable  intangible  which they could mutually use.    The nature of this particular unique and valuable intangible was such that the respective value of unique and valuable contributions by Corporation-HK and Corporation-F in the year  in  question  was  proportional  to  the  relative  expenditure  of Corporation-HK and Corporation-F on the intangible in that year. Corporation-HK  and  Corporation-F  exclusively  sold  products  to third parties.    It was determined that: the most appropriate method to  be  used  was  the  residual  profits  split  method;  the  non-unique transactions should be allocated an initial return of 10% of the cost of goods sold since the manufacturing activities of Corporation-HK

and Corporation-F were less complex; and the residual profit should be  split  in  proportion  to  the  expenditure  of  Corporation-HK  and Corporation-F in relation to the unique and valuable intangible.

The profits of Corporation-HK and Corporation-F would be computed as follows:

|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| Corporation-HK | Initial return for the manufacturing activities of Corporation-HK ($60 × 10%) | 6   |
| Corporation-F  | Initial return for the manufacturing activities                               | 17  |
|                | of Corporation-F ($170 × 10%)                                                 |     |
|                | Total profit allocated through initial returns                                | 23  |

Step 2: Determine the residual profit to be split

|                                                                               | $   |

| Corporation-F's expenditure in relation to the unique and valuable intangible | 63  |

|                                            |                      | $   |

## Example 2.11

Corporation-F resident in Jurisdiction F manufactured goods that it sold  to  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary  Corporation-HK  resident  in Hong  Kong,  which  resold  the  goods  to  independent  parties.    The total relevant profit from the operations was $1,000. Corporation-HK was rewarded $250 for the marketing, distribution and  other  functions  undertaken  based  upon  an  analysis  of  typical returns  for  that  type  of  business  activity  while  Corporation-F  was rewarded  $150  based  upon  an  analysis  of  returns  for  similar manufacturing functions.

## Profit scenario

The remaining profit of $600 would then be allocated on the basis of the contribution of each of the persons to the value of the intangibles, say 10% (being $60) to Corporation-F and say 90% (being $540) to Corporation-HK.

|                                   | Corporation-F Corporation-HK   |           | Total profits   |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Tangible assets, functions, risks | 150                            | 250       | 400             |
| Intangibles                       | 60 (10%)                       | 540 (90%) | 600             |
| Total                             | 210                            | 790       | 1,000           |

## Loss scenario

If  an  overall  loss  was  incurred,  the  same  logic  should  be  followed. Corporation-HK  would  still  be  rewarded  $250  for  the  marketing, distribution  and  other  functions  undertaken  while  Corporation-F would  still be rewarded $150  for the manufacturing function undertaken.    The residual loss of $900 would then be allocated on the basis of the contribution of each of the enterprises to the value of the intangible, say, 10% being $90 to Corporation-F and, say, 90% being $810 to Corporation-HK.

|                                   | Corporation-F Corporation-HK   |             | Total profits   |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Tangible assets, functions, risks | 150                            | 250         | 400             |
| Intangibles                       | - 90 (10%)                     | - 810 (90%) | - 900           |
| Total                             | 60                             | - 560       | - 500           |

While  this  example  is  based  on  fixed  contributions,  market  reality may  be  such  that  a  distributor's  margin  may  change  because  of  a range of factors including low levels of sales, promotion costs and discounts  arising  from  competition. The  possibility, therefore, exists  for  lower  than  normal  rates  of  return  during  lean  years  and commensurately higher returns during good years.

## Other approaches to splitting profits

41. There are other possible approaches that may be used in splitting the profits between associated persons.    These include:
2. (a) splitting  the  relevant  profits  so  that  each  associated  person participating in the transaction earns the same rate of return on the capital employed in that transaction.    The method should be used cautiously, particularly  if  some  of  the  group  persons are providing high value added services;
3. (b) splitting  the  relevant  profits  based  on  the  division  of  profits that  actually  results  from  comparable  transactions  among independent  persons.    The  use  of  this  method  is  extremely remote because it will be difficult to find independent persons

- engaged  in  transactions  that  are  sufficiently  comparable.    If such  comparable  can  be  found,  then  the  traditional  methods should have been adopted;
- (c) splitting the relevant profits using a flexible methodology that recognizes the contributions by different persons over economic and product life cycles;
- (d) splitting  the  relevant  profits  using  a  formula.    Weightings used in the formula must be based on some form of external market data.

## OECD revised guidance

42. In  June  2018,  OECD  published  the Revised  Guidance  on  the Application of the Transactional Profit Split  Method . In general, the Commissioner will follow the guidance and examples contained therein.

## Transactional net margin method

43. The  transactional  net  margin  method  (TNMM)  examines  the  net profit margin relative to an appropriate base such as sales, costs or assets that a person realizes from  a controlled transaction (or transactions that it is appropriate  to  aggregate).    This  is  compared  with  the  result  achieved  by independent persons on a similar transaction or transactions.    TNMM operates in  a  manner  similar  to  the  cost  plus  and  resale  price  methods.    The  main difference between the TNMM and the profit split method is that the former is applied only to one of the associated persons whereas the latter is applied to all the  relevant  associated  persons.    For  an  example  of  circumstances  in  which the TNMM was used on an 'aggregation' basis, see Daihatsu Australia Pty Ltd v FCT (2001), 47 ATR 156.
44. The TNMM requires the comparison of net margins obtained in its related party dealings against either:
3. (a) the  net  margins  of  the  person's  dealings  with  independent persons in comparable circumstances; or

- (b) the  net  margins  earned  in  comparable  dealings  between  two independent persons.
45. The  focus  is  initially  on  examining  the  net  margin  relative  to  an appropriate  base.    The  relative  usefulness  of  the  various  profitability  ratios depends largely on the facts of the case and the extent of reliable data being available for the person and any comparables.    Any ratio analysis should be directed at net profit or some similar point because the TNMM emphasizes the comparison to be undertaken at the net profit rather than the gross profit level.
46. Under the TNMM, margins are calculated after operating expenses. As a result, differences in transactions that would not have an effect on a gross margin need to be accounted for under this method.    Multiple year data should be  considered  in  the  TNMM  for  both  the  person  under  examination  and independent persons to the extent their net margins are being compared, to take into  account  the  effects  on  profits  of  product  life  cycles  and  short  term economic conditions.
47. In the determination of the net profit indicator for the application of the TNMM, only those items that directly or indirectly relate to the controlled transaction at hand, and are of an operating nature should be taken into account. The following are some common profit indicators:
- (a) ratio of net profit before tax to sales;
- (b) ratio of net profit (before interest and tax) to sales;
- (c) ratio of net profit (before interest and tax) to cost of goods sold and operating expenses;
- (d) ratio of net profit before tax to shareholders' funds;
- (e) ratio of net profit before interest and tax to assets;
- (f) Berry ratios (i.e. ratios of gross profit to operating expenses).
48. Berry ratios are very sensitive to classification of costs as operating expenses  or  not  and  therefore  can  pose  comparability  issues.    To  consider

whether Berry ratio is an appropriate profit indicator, it is necessary to consider that:

- (a) the value of the functions performed in the controlled transaction (taking account of assets used and risks assumed) is proportional to the operating expenses;
- (b) the value of the functions performed in the controlled transaction (taking account of assets used and risks assumed) is not materially affected by the value of the products distributed (i.e. it is not proportional to sales); and
- (c) the person does not perform, in the controlled transactions, any other  significant  function  (e.g.  manufacturing  function)  that should be remunerated using another method or profit indicator.
49. The TNMM is unlikely to be reliable if each party to a transaction makes unique and valuable contributions.    The TNMM may be applicable in cases where one of the parties makes all the unique and valuable contributions involved in the controlled transaction, while the other party does not make any unique and valuable contribution.    There are also many cases where a party to a  transaction  makes contributions that are  not unique (e.g. use of non-unique business processes or non-unique market knowledge).    In such cases, it may be possible to apply the traditional transaction method or TNMM.
50. There are a number of weaknesses peculiar to the TNMM, which can be compounded by its inappropriate application.    Amongst these weaknesses is  the  fact  that  the  net  profit  indicator  of  a  company  can  be  influenced  by  a range of factors that either have no effect or a different effect on gross margins or  the  actual  price  of  a  transaction.    This  makes  comparing  the  tested  party with  another  person  very  difficult  if  that  person  is  not  affected  by  the  same factors.    For  instance,  the  supposedly  comparable  person  may  have  been managed and run very badly, while the tested party may have been run very well.    It may be useful to take into account a range of results when using the TNMM.    A range of results may mitigate unquantifiable differences between the tested party and independent persons carrying out comparable transactions.

## Intra-group Service

## Service arrangement

1. Intra-group service arrangements encompass a wide array of services including administrative, technical, financial and commercial services. Basically,  the  Commissioner  accepts  the  principles  defined  by  the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (the  TPG)  surrounding  the  charging  for  intra-group  services. According  to  the  guidelines,  there  are  two  main  issues  when  analyzing intra-group services:
2. (a) determining whether intra-group services have been rendered; and
3. (b) determining an arm's length charge.
2. Paragraph  7.6  of  the  TPG  sets  out  the  main  condition  when considering whether a service has been provided:
5. '… whether an independent enterprise in comparable circumstances would have been willing to pay for the activity if performed for it by an  independent  enterprise  or  would  have  performed  the  activity in-house  for itself. If the activity is not one  for  which  the independent  enterprise  would  have  been  willing  to  pay  or  perform for  itself,  the  activity  ordinarily  should  not  be  considered  as  an intra-group service under the arm's length principle. '
3. The TPG further requires the intra-group service entity providing the service  to  determine  which  services  relate  to  shareholder  activities,  which services benefit specific group members, and which services benefit the group as a whole.
4. The costs of shareholder activities are not to be recharged unless they are performed on behalf of the parent by a group company in which case they should  be  recharged  to  the  parent.    These  are  activities  performed  for  the benefit  of  the  parent  company  in  its  role  as  shareholder  and  do  not  directly benefit the subsidiaries.    What is a shareholder activity is a matter of fact, but should include:
8. (a) meetings of the parent company's shareholders;
9. (b) issuing of shares in the parent company;
10. (c) costs of the supervisory board;
11. (d) maintaining the share register;
12. (e) activities  to  satisfy  statutory  reporting  requirements  of  the parent company;
13. (f) an audit of the parent company.
5. If a parent company provides services for a subsidiary that duplicate what the subsidiary  already  performs,  or  are  otherwise  unnecessary,  then  the services should not be compensated.

## Example 3.1

To satisfy its own investors and legal requirements, Parent Corporation-HK audited the financial statements and records of its wholly  owned  subsidiary  Corporation-F  resident  in  Jurisdiction  F. The audit duplicated an audit Corporation-F performed on its own under its own domestic laws.

Since  the  audit  was  performed  by  Parent  Corporation-HK  as  a steward for its own investments rather than benefiting Corporation-F. Parent Corporation-HK should bear the cost of the audit.

## Deduction of expenditure paid for intra-group service

6. An expenditure made under an intra-group service arrangement and calculated using a particular mark-up could be deductible under section 16 but the  question  of  whether  the  expenditure  made  under  the  intra-group  service arrangement is deductible depends on what the expenditure was calculated to achieve from a practical and business point of view, which is a question of fact.
7. An expenditure incurred in obtaining the supply of goods or services from  another  associated  person  under  a  contract  will  be  characterized  by reference  to  the  contractual  benefits  passing  to  the  person  under  the  contract and  the  way  those  benefits  relate  to  the  person's  profit  earning  activities  or business.
8. Where the  benefits  conferred  by  a  service  arrangement  provide  an objective commercial explanation for the whole of the expenditure made under the service arrangement, then the service arrangement will suffice to characterize the expenditure  as  an  outgoing  or  expense  incurred  in  the production of chargeable profits.
9. Where  the  benefits  passing  to  the  associated  person  under  an intra-group  service  arrangement  do  not  provide  an  objective  commercial explanation  for  the  whole  of  the  expenditure,  the  service  arrangement  alone, without more, will not suffice to characterize the expenditure.    In that case a broader  examination  of  all  of  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  expenditure will be required to determine what the expenditure was for.    Depending on the circumstances  of  the  particular  case,  this  may  include  an  examination  of  the relationship between the person and the service entity, the manner in which the person  and  the  service  entity  have  dealt  with  each  other  and  the  taxpayer's purpose, motive or intention in incurring the expenditure.
10. A  service  arrangement  may  not  suffice  to  provide  an  objective commercial explanation for the whole of the expenditure if:
6. (a) the  service  fees  and  charges  are  disproportionate  or  grossly excessive  in  relation  to  the  benefits  conferred  by  the  service arrangement;

- (b) the  service  fees  and  charges  guarantee  the  service  entity  a certain profit outcome without reasonable commercial explanation; or
- (c) the  service  fees  and  charges  generate  profits  in  the  service entity  without  any  clear  evidence  that  the  service  entity  has added any value or performed any substantive functions.    For example, this  might  occur  where  there  is  no  clear  separation between the service entity's business activities and those of the taxpayer.

## Amount of intra-group service charge

11. In  determining  whether  the  amount  of  the  charge  is  in  accordance with the arm's length principle, both the basis of charging and an appropriate margin must be determined.    The TPG suggests two main methods: the direct charge method and the indirect charge method.
12. A direct charge is one levied by a particular affiliate for a particular service,  whilst  an  indirect  charge  is  raised  through  other  means,  usually allocation  keys.    A  direct  charge  has  the  advantage  of  providing  greater transparency and provides further documentary evidence as to the validity of the charges.    The amount to be recharged can be ascertained from time sheets, charges to an account or job code, etc.
13. An  indirect  charge  is  made  where  for  some  reason,  such  as  the administrative  burden  involved,  the  costs  incurred  on  behalf  of  any  one associate cannot reliably be tracked.    The result is that all costs incurred for whomever are collected together and then shared out among the beneficiaries. The making of an indirect charge normally involve a degree of estimation and approximation.    Allocations are usually made by means of keys.
14. For example, charges could be calculated on the basis of head count (for HR costs), turnover (for marketing costs), number of computer terminals in use (for IT support), etc.    According to the OECD guidelines, the allocation method must be consistent with what a comparable independent person would have been prepared to accept.

15. Toll  manufacturing  is  an  example  of  an  activity  that  involves intra-group  services.    In  such  a  case  the  production  corporation  may  get extensive  instruction  about  what  to  produce,  in  what  quantity  and  of  what quality.    The production corporation bears low risks and may be assured that its entire output will be purchased, assuming product quality requirements are met. Under the circumstances, the production corporation could be considered  as  performing  a  service  and  the  cost  plus  method  could  be appropriate.

16. An  intra-group  service  entity  providing  services  to  its  associated persons  has  to  ensure  that  the  services  are  identified,  a  charge  is  made,  the charge is at arm's length and that adequate documentation is kept.    Charging an  arm's  length  price  rather  than  all  relevant  costs  will  be  more  satisfactory where the provision of service is a principal activity of the associated person, where the profit element is significant, or where direct charging is possible as a basis from which to determine the arm's length price.    In other words, a profit element should be included where the service entity is engaged in the trade or business  of  rendering  or  providing  similar  services  to  unrelated  parties  or where the service provided is one of its principal activities.

## Trading Stock

## The market value principle

1. It  is  a  well-accepted  principle  that  tax  computation  needs  to  be adjusted to reflect the market value of an asset with respect to which a change of  intention  occurs  (i.e.  the  market  value  principle):  see Sharkey  v  Wernher [1956] AC 58 and Simmons v IRC [1980] 1 WLR 1196.    This principle also applies where a trading stock is appropriated for non-trade purpose or acquired/ disposed of other than in the course of trade.
2. In Hong Kong, the market value principle has all along been applied in determining profits or loss from appropriation of trading stock for profits tax purposes.    The  principle  has  been  applied  by  the  Board  of  Review  and  the courts  in  a  number  of  cases.    The  decision  of  the  Court  of  Final  Appeal  in Church  Body  of  the  Hong  Kong  Sheng  Kung  Hui  &amp;  Anor  v  CIR (2016)  19 HKCFAR 54 is a recent example.
3. Section 15BA has codified the market value principle as reflected in Hong Kong's jurisprudence and the long standing tax treatments for trading of assets.    Section 15BA requires adjustments to taxable profits or allowable loss to reflect:
4. (a) any appropriation from or into trading asset; or
5. (b) any  acquisition  or  disposal  of  trading  asset  other  than  in  the course of trade at market value.
4. In  case  of  a  change  of  intention  towards  an  asset,  section  15BA follows  the  case  law  to  require  the  application  of  the  market  value  principle when the  change  occurs.    This  is  because  when  a  capital  asset  is  converted into trading stock, the market value at the time of change needs to be brought into account for computing any balancing adjustment on capital allowance, and as the cost for determining the profits or loss upon disposal.    Likewise, when

trading stock is appropriated as capital asset, it is necessary to account for the market value upon appropriation so that any change (including diminution) in valuation  of  trading  stock  can  be  recognized  and  the  adjusted  value  can  be adopted for computing capital allowance afterwards.

5. The situations to which section 15BA applies may be distinguished from that in Nice Cheer Investment Ltd v CIR (2013) 16 HKCFAR 813.    In the Nice  Cheer case,  the  issue  in  dispute  is  whether  the  gains  resulting  from revaluation  of  trading  securities  held  at  the  end  of  the  accounting  period  as required by fair value  accounting should be included in the tax computation. The case does not involve any change of intention of the asset concerned, and the Court of Final Appeal held that such revaluation gains are not chargeable to profits tax.    Section 15BA only deals with change of intention towards assets and acquisition or disposal of assets other than in the course of trade.    It has no  application  where  there  is  neither  change  of  intention  nor  non-trade acquisition or appropriation.    In other words, any gains arising from year-end revaluation of a landed property (classified as investment property) will remain not taxable in accordance with the Nice Cheer case.

## Relationship between sections 15BA and 15C(a)

6. In valuation of trading stock on cessation of business, section 15C(a) provides that where trading stock is sold or transferred for valuable consideration  to  a  person  who  carries  on  or  intends  to  carry  on  a  trade  or business in Hong Kong so that the cost will be deductible when the purchaser's trade or business profits are computed, the actual consideration for the transfer can be brought into the vendor's closing accounts.
7. Section  15BA  is  intended  to  codify  the  market  value  principle explained above and is not intended to affect the application of section 15C(a).

## Example 4.1

Corporation-HK1 is a property developer in Hong Kong.    For the purpose of redevelopment in Site X, Corporation-HK1 set up special purpose  companies,  Corporation-HK2  and  Corporation-HK3  (i.e. acquiring companies) and Corporation-HK4 (i.e. developer company).    Corporation-HK1  purchased old property units in Site

X  through  Corporation-HK2  and  Corporation-HK3.    After  all  the old property units have been acquired,  Corporation-HK2  and Corporation-HK3 ceased their business and transferred the property units into Corpoation-HK4 for the purposes of development.

Corporation-HK2 and Corporation-HK3 can continue to transfer the property units at the cost of acquisition to Corporation-HK4, and will not be regarded as deriving any gain from the transfers by virtue of section  15C(a).    Section  15BA  will  not  be  invoked  to  bring  the market  value  of  the  property  units  into  the  tax  computations  of Corporation-HK2 and Corporation-HK3.

## Relationship between sections 15BA, 15C and 50AAF

8. Section  50AAF(8)  provides  that  section  50AAF(1)  to  (6)  will  not apply in relation to a provision made or imposed in relation to any trading stock if section 15C applies in relation to the trading stock.    Section 15BA(6) also provides that section 15BA(4) does not apply to a disposal and section 15BA(5) does not apply to an acquisition of any trading stock if section 15C applies to the trading stock.

## Intangibles

## OECD transfer pricing guidelines

1. Chapter VI of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (the TPG) provides guidance specifically tailored to determine arm's length provisions for transactions that involve the use or transfer of intangibles under Article 9 (i.e. associated enterprises) of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (the  MTC).    The  guidance  aims  to  address  base  erosion  and  profit shifting  (BEPS)  issues  resulting  from  the  transfer  of  intangibles  among members  of  a  multinational  enterprise  (MNE)  group.    In  gist,  MNE  group members  should  be  compensated  based  on  the  value  they  create  through functions  performed,  assets  used  and  risks  assumed  in  the  development, enhancement, maintenance, protection and exploitation (DEMPE) of intangibles.
2. The  guidance  was  developed  under  Action  8  of  the  OECD/  G20 BEPS  Project  to  prevent  BEPS  by  transferring  intangibles  among  group members by:
3. (a) adopting a broad and clearly delineated definition of intangibles;
4. (b) ensuring  that  profits  associated  with  the  transfer  and  use  of intangibles  are  appropriately  allocated  in  accordance  with value creation; and
5. (c) developing  transfer  pricing rules or  special  measures  for transfers of hard-to-value intangibles (HTVI).
3. Chapter VI of the TPG places the guidance on intangibles within the wider context of the guidance on accurately delineating the transaction and the analysis of risks contained in Chapter I, which is relevant in dealing with the difference between anticipated and actual returns to intangibles.
4. The framework for analyzing risks contained in Chapter I of the TPG depends on  a  very  specific  and  meaningful  control  requirement,  which  takes into account both the capability to perform the relevant functions and assume risks  in  relation  to  intangibles,  together  with  the  actual  performance  and assumption of such functions and risks.    If an associated person contractually assuming  a  specific  risk  does  not  exercise  control  over  that  risk  nor  has  the financial capacity to assume the risk, then the framework contained in Chapter I  determines  that  the  risk  will  be  allocated  to  another  member  of  the  MNE group that does exercise such control and has the financial capacity to assume the risk.    This control requirement is used in Chapter VI to determine which parties  assume  risks  in  relation  to  intangibles,  but  also  for  assessing  which member  of  the  MNE  group  in  fact  controls  the  performance  of  outsourced functions in relation to the DEMPE of the intangible.
5. The  guidance  refers  to  the  treatment  of  the  return  to  funding contained in Chapter I, and ensures that funding of DEMPE of an intangible by an entity that does not perform any of the important functions in relation to the intangible and does not exercise control over the financial risk will generate no more than a risk-free return.
6. In relation to arm's length pricing when valuation is highly uncertain at  the  time  of  the  transaction,  the  guidance  recognizes  that  third  parties  may adopt different approaches for taking account of uncertainties that are relevant for  the  value  of  an  intangible,  including  to  conclude  a  contract  based  on contingent payments dependent on the actual results achieved.    The guidance also  takes  into  account  that,  because  of  information  asymmetries,  it  proves difficult  to  evaluate  the  reliability  of  the  information  on  which  the  taxpayer priced  the  transaction,  especially  in  relation  to  intangibles  with  a  highly uncertain  value  at  the  time  of  the  transfer.    To  address  these  challenges,  an approach  to  pricing  HTVI  has  been  developed  which  allows  the  taxpayer  to demonstrate that its pricing is based on a thorough transfer pricing analysis and leads to an arm's length outcome, while the approach at the same time protects the tax administrations from the negative effects of information asymmetry.    It does so by ensuring that tax administrations can consider ex post outcomes as presumptive evidence about the appropriateness of the ex ante pricing arrangements,  and  the  taxpayer  cannot  demonstrate  that  the  uncertainty  has been appropriately taken into account in the pricing methodology adopted.

7. In  summary,  the  guidance  contained  in  Chapter  VI  of  the  TPG ensures that:
2. (a) legal  ownership  of  intangibles  by  an  associated  person  alone does  not  determine  ultimate  and  complete  entitlement  to returns from the exploitation of intangibles;
3. (b) associated persons performing important value creating functions related to the DEMPE of the intangibles can expect appropriate remuneration;
4. (c) an associated person assuming risk in relation to the DEMPE of the intangibles must exercise control over the risks and have the financial capacity to assume the risks;
5. (d) entitlement of any member of the MNE group to profit or loss relating to differences between actual and expected profits will depend  on  which  entity  or  entities  assume(s)  the  risks  that caused these differences and whether the entity or entities are performing the important functions in relation to the DEMPE of  the  intangibles  or  contributing  to  the  control  over  the economically significant risks and it is determined that arm's length remuneration of these functions would include a profit sharing element;
6. (e) an  associated  person  providing  funding  and  assuming  the related financial risks but not performing any other functions relating to the intangible could generally only expect a risk-adjusted return on its funding; and
7. (f) if  the  associated  person  providing  funding  does  not  exercise control  over  the  financial  risks  associated  with  the  funding, then it is entitled to no more than a risk-free return.

## OECD Guidance on Hard-to-Value Intangibles

8. The guidance contained in the Guidance for Tax Administrations on the Application of the Approach to Hard-to-Value Intangibles aims at reaching

a  common understanding and practice on how to apply adjustments resulting from the application of the approach applicable to HTVI.

9. The guidance improves consistency and reduces the risk of economic double taxation by:
2. (a) presenting the principles that should underlie the application of the HTVI approach by tax administrations;
3. (b) providing a number of examples clarifying the application of the HTVI approach in different scenarios; and
4. (c) addressing the interaction between the HTVI approach and the access to the mutual agreement procedure under the applicable tax treaty.

The guidance on the application of the HTVI approach has been incorporated into the TPG as an annex to Chapter VI.    In general, the Commissioner will follow the guidance.

## Details of the OECD guidance

## Intangibles

10. 'Intangible'  means  something  which  is  not  a  physical  asset  or  a financial  asset,  which  is  capable  of  being  owned  or  controlled  for  use  in commercial activities, and whose use or transfer would be compensated had it occurred in a transaction between independent parties in comparable circumstances.    This includes various intellectual properties (such as patents, know-how and trade secrets, trademarks, trade names and brands), rights under contracts and government licences, goodwill and ongoing concern value etc.

## Intangible ownership

11. For  transfer  pricing  purposes,  legal  ownership  of  intangibles,  by itself, does not confer any right ultimately to retain returns derived by the MNE group  from  exploiting  the  intangible,  even  though  such  returns  may  initially accrue to the legal owner as a result of its legal or contractual right to exploit

the  intangible.    The  return  ultimately  retained  by  or  attributed  to  the  legal owner depends upon the functions it performs, the assets it uses, and the risks it assumes,  and  upon  the  contributions  made  by  other  MNE  group  members through their functions performed, assets used and risks assumed.

## Use of assets

12. Group  members  that  use  assets  in  the  DEMPE  of  an  intangible should  receive  appropriate  compensation  for  doing  so.    Such  assets  may include,  without  limitation,  intangibles  used  in  research,  development  or marketing  (e.g.  know-how,  customer  relationship,  etc.),  physical  assets,  or funding.    One member of an MNE group may fund some or all of the DEMPE of an intangible, while one or more other members perform all of the relevant functions.

## Assumption of risks

13. Particular  types  of  risk  that  may  have  importance  in  a  functional analysis relating to transactions  involving intangibles include:  risk  relating to development  of  intangibles;  risk  of  product  obsolescence;  infringement  risk; risk relating to products and services based on the intangible and exploitation risk.

## Analyzing controlled transactions

14. In  analyzing  transactions  involving  intangibles  between  associated persons, the following steps are required:
2. (a) identify  the  intangibles  used  or  transferred  in  the  transaction with specificity;
3. (b) identify the full contractual arrangements for determining the legal ownership of intangibles, the contractual rights, obligation and assumption of risks;
4. (c) identify  the  parties  performing  the  DEMPE  functions  of  the intangibles,  using  assets  and  managing  risks  relating  to  the functions by means of functional analysis;

- (d) confirm  the  consistency  between  the  terms  of  the  relevant contractual  arrangements  and  the  conduct  of  the  parties,  and determine  whether  the  party  assume  and  control  the  risks relating to the DEMPE functions of the intangibles;
- (e) delineate  the  actual  controlled  transactions  relating  to  the DEMPE functions of the intangibles; and
- (f) determine  arm's  length  prices  for  the  transactions  consistent with  each  party's  contributions  of  function  performed,  assets used and risks assumed.

## Determining arm's length prices

15. Members  of  MNE  group  performing  the  DEMPE  functions,  using assets  and  assuming  risks  that  are  expected  to  contribute  to  the  value  of  the intangibles  should  be  compensated  for  their  contributions  according  to  the arm's length principle, transfer pricing methods and comparability analysis set out  in  Chapters  I  to  III  of  the  TPG.    In  identifying  arm's  length  prices  for transactions  among  MNE  group  members,  it  is  necessary  to  determine  by means  of  functional  analysis  the  contributions  of  members  relating  to  the creation  of  intangible  value.    It  is  also  important  to  consider  comparability factors that may contribute to the creation of value or the generation of return derived by the MNE group from the exploitation of intangibles.

## Applying the HTVI approach

16. Following the OECD guidance, the Department may make appropriate adjustments, including adjustments  that reflect an alternative pricing structure that differs from that adopted by the taxpayer but reflects one which would have been made by independent persons in comparable circumstances to take account of the valuation uncertainty in the pricing of the transaction (e.g. milestone payments, running royalties with or without adjustable  elements,  price  adjustment  clauses  or  a  combination  of  these characteristics).

## Section 15F: sums derived from intellectual properties by non-Hong Kong resident associates

17. Section 15F seeks to give effect to the guidance in Chapter VI of the TPG in relation to intellectual properties.    The key of the guidance is to ensure that profits associated with the transfer and use of intangibles are appropriately allocated among member of a MNE group on the basis of their contribution to value creation.
18. The provisions in section 15F, which aligns taxation of income from intellectual  property  with  value  creation  contributions  in  Hong  Kong,  are consistent with the relevant requirements in the TPG.    The main provisions of section 15F are as follows:
3. (a) section 15F(1) refers to the situation where a person has made value creation contributions in relation to an intellectual property through performing the functions of, providing assets in and assuming risks relating to the DEMPE functions of the intellectual property;
4. (b) section 15F(2) caters for a situation where a person has made value contributions in Hong Kong in relation to any intellectual property but a sum accrued to, or is received by or for  the  benefit  of,  a  non-Hong  Kong  resident  associate  in respect of the exhibition or use of or a right to exhibit or use (whether in or outside Hong Kong) the intellectual property; or the imparting or undertaking to impart knowledge directly or indirectly connected with the use (whether in or outside Hong Kong) of the intellectual property;
5. (c) section  15F(3)  treats  that  part  of  the  sum  attributable  to  the person's value creation contributions in Hong Kong as Hong Kong sourced trading receipt and charges the person to profits tax in respect of the attributable sum;
6. (d) section  15F(4)  provides  that  the  non-Hong  Kong  resident associate is not to be chargeable to profits tax in respect of the attributable sum.

19. For  the  purpose  of  section  15F,  the  term  'intellectual  property'  is defined  to  include  cinematograph  or  television  film  or  tape,  any  sound recording, advertising material connected with such film, tape or recording; or patent, design, trade mark, copyright material, layout-design (topography) of an integrated  circuit,  performer's  right,  plant  variety  right,  secret  process  or formula, or other property or right of a similar nature.
20. According to the TPG, legal ownership of intangibles, by itself, does not  confer  any  right  to  retain  returns  derived  by  the  MNE  group  from exploiting  the  intangible,  even  though  such  returns  may  accrue  to  the  legal owner as a result of its legal or contractual right to exploit the intangible.    For example, in the case of an internally developed intangible, if the legal owner performs  no  relevant  functions,  uses  no  relevant  assets,  and  assumes  no relevant risks, but acts solely as a title holding entity, the legal owner will not ultimately be entitled to any portion of the return derived by the MNE group from the exploitation of the intangible other than arm's length compensation, if any, for holding title.
21. The  effect  of  section  15F  is  that  a  person  who  has  contributed  in Hong Kong to the DEMPE (the relevant functions) of an intellectual property is to be taxed on such part of the income derived from the intellectual property as is attributable to that  person's  contribution  in  carrying out the relevant functions even if the income accrues to the person's overseas associate (i.e. the legal owner of the intellectual property).
22. To address the concern about possible double taxation, the Assessor will make sure that a person will not be subject to double taxation in respect of the same income from an intellectual property.    The non-Hong Kong resident associated person will not be chargeable to profits tax in respect of the relevant sum to the extent that section 15F applies.

## Example 5.1

Associated  Corporation-HK  was  responsible  for  carrying  out  the functions relating to the DEMPE of an intellectual property in Hong Kong, but the legal ownership of the intellectual property was taken up  by  Associated  Corporation-F  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F  which was  a  low-tax  jurisdiction.    While  Associated  Corporation-F  did

not perform any of the relevant functions in relation to the intellectual  property,  it  earned  the  royalty  income  derived  from  the intellectual property, paying a limited amount of tax in Jurisdiction-F. On the other hand, Associated Corporation-HK was not remunerated with a reasonable return on the relevant functions performed.

Associated Corporation-HK would be assessed under section 15F in respect of the royalty income derived from the intellectual property to the extent of the DEMPE functions it performed in Hong Kong.

## Example 5.2

Associated Corporation-HK sold a self-developed intellectual property  to  Associated  Corporation-F  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F  at an  arm's  length  price.    Royalties  were  received  by  Associated Corporation-F for use of the intellectual property from others.

In the absence of any tax avoidance motive, if the transfer of rights and obligations was accepted by the Commissioner as having been completed  at  the  time  of  the  sale  on  an  arm's  length  basis,  the subsequent  benefit  derived  from  the  intellectual  property  after  the sale should be attributable to Associated Corporation-F.    However, if Associated Corporation-HK continued to perform  DEMPE functions in relation to this intellectual property in Hong Kong after the transfer,  royalties  accrued  to  Associated  Corporation-F  but attributable  to  those  DEMPE  functions  performed  by  Associated Corporation-HK  in  Hong  Kong  would  be  regarded  as  a  trading receipt  arising  in  or  derived  from  Hong  Kong  in  accordance  with section 15F.      If the facts disclosed that the transfer was or formed part  of  a  transaction  designed  to  avoid  tax,  the  anti-avoidance provisions could  also  be  applied  to  counter  the  tax  benefits  arising from such a transaction.

## Commencement date

23. Section 15F applies in relation to a year of assessment beginning on or after 1 April 2019.
