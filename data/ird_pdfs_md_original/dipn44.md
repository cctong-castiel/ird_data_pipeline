## INTRODUCTION

On 11 February 1998, representatives of the Mainland of China ('the Mainland') and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ('Hong Kong') signed a Memorandum that detailed an 'Arrangement between the Mainland of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double  Taxation  on  Income'  ('the  Limited  Arrangement').    The  Limited Arrangement covers mainly business profits of an enterprise operating through a  permanent establishment, shipping, air or land transport income, as well as income from personal services. Some two years later,  on  2  February  2000, the Mainland and Hong Kong signed the 'Air Services Arrangement between the  Mainland  of  China  and  the  Hong  Kong  Special  Administrative  Region' ('the Air Services Arrangement').

2. However,  with  China's  subsequent  accession  to  the  World  Trade Organisation  and  the  increasingly  close  economic  ties  between  the  Mainland and Hong Kong, both the Mainland and Hong Kong considered it necessary to expand  the  Limited  Arrangement  into  a  comprehensive  arrangement  for  the avoidance  of  double  taxation,  i.e.  one  on  a  par  with  international  standards. Accordingly,  on  21  August  2006,  the  Mainland  and  Hong  Kong  signed  an 'Arrangement  between  the  Mainland  of  China  and  the  Hong  Kong  Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income'('the Comprehensive Arrangement'),  to  eliminate  any  situation  of  double  taxation that  might  otherwise  be  faced  by  a  Mainland  or  Hong  Kong  investor  in  the conduct  of  cross-border  economic  activities. In  the  lead  up  to  the  signing, differences in the interpretation of some of the provisions of the Comprehensive Arrangement were identified by both Sides during the course of  negotiations. However,  neither  the  Mainland  nor  Hong  Kong  had  any desire to engage in prolonged discussions that could hinder the early implementation of the  Comprehensive Arrangement.    Hence,  the  differences were put aside for further deliberation in the post implementation stage. Both Sides then resumed discussions and consensus was reached on the interpretation  and  implementation  of  the  outstanding  issues. The  Mainland and Hong Kong exchanged letters ('the exchange letters') and formally signed the 'Second Protocol to the Arrangement between the Mainland of China and the  Hong  Kong  Special  Administrative  Region  for  the  Avoidance  of  Double Taxation  and  the  Prevention  of  Fiscal  Evasion  with  respect  to  Taxes  on

Income'('the Second Protocol') on 11 September 2007 and 30 January 2008 respectively.

## ARRANGEMENT FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION

3. For the purpose of giving effect to the Comprehensive Arrangement, an Order ('Specification of Arrangements (the Mainland of China) (Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on  Income)  Order')  was  made  by  the  Chief  Executive  in  Council  on  27 October 2006, under section 49 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112) ('the Ordinance'). The Order was published in the Gazette as Legal Notice 234  of  2006. For  the  purpose  of  giving  effect  to  the  Second  Protocol,  an Order ('Specification of Arrangements (the Mainland of China) (Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income)  (Second  Protocol)  Order')  was  made  by  the  Chief  Executive  in Council on 15 April 2008. The Order was published in the Gazette as Legal Notice 89 of 2008.
4. The  purpose  of  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement  is  to  allocate  the right to tax between the two Sides on a reasonable basis so as to avoid double taxation  of  the  same  item  of  income  in  both  Sides. The  provisions  of  the Comprehensive Arrangement have been made by reference to those contained in the Model Tax Conventions of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and  Development  (the  'OECD')  and  the  United  Nations.    Appropriate modifications have been made to cope with the particular requirements of the Mainland  and  Hong  Kong.    In  the  interpretation  and  application  of  the provisions  of  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement,  both  Sides  will  refer  to  the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969), the Commentaries on the relevant Articles of the Model Tax Conventions of the OECD and the United Nations,  as  well  as  to  their  respective  principles  of  interpretation  of  taxation law.

## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPREHENSIVE ARRANGEMENT AND THE ORDINANCE

5. The Comprehensive Arrangement has been implemented in accordance with section 49 of the Ordinance and accordingly has legal effect. The  Comprehensive  Arrangement  and  the  Ordinance  (including  subsidiary legislation)  are  interrelated  and  complement  each  other. For  matters  falling within  its  scope,  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement  performs  the  function  of allocating the right to tax between the two Sides. When the right to tax has been  allocated,  both  Sides  will  continue  to  refer  to  their  respective  domestic taxation legislation to resolve problems of tax administration and enforcement, such as in deciding whether certain income should be subject to tax, and in the computation of assessable income and tax payable.
6. In  handling  problems  arising  from  any  inconsistency  between  the Comprehensive Arrangement and the Ordinance, priority will be accorded to the  Comprehensive  Arrangement  to  ensure  compliance  with  its  provisions. Hong  Kong  adopts  the  'preferential  treatment'  principle,  i.e.  where  the Comprehensive  Arrangement  and  the  Ordinance  contain  different  provisions relating to the same matter, preference will be given to the provisions that are most beneficial to the taxpayers. For example, if a Mainland resident renders employment  services  in  Hong  Kong  but  does  not  meet  the  exemption conditions  stipulated  in  Article  14  (e.g.  his  remuneration  is  paid  by  a  Hong Kong employer), he will still be exempt from tax under the Ordinance if his visit to Hong Kong in the year of assessment concerned does not exceed a total of 60 days.
7. The Comprehensive Arrangement should not affect existing concessional practices in Hong Kong. Take for example the case of a Hong Kong manufacturer who concludes a contract processing arrangement with a Mainland  entity.    In  accordance  with  paragraphs  13  to  19  of  Departmental Interpretation  and  Practice  Notes  No.  21  (Revised  1998),  50%  of  his  profits may be regarded as profits arising outside Hong Kong and not chargeable to profits tax in Hong Kong. This method of apportioning profits that arise both inside and outside Hong Kong on a 50:50 basis remains applicable. According  to  the  provisions  of  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement,  the  Hong Kong manufacturer could be regarded as having a permanent establishment in the Mainland and is therefore liable to tax there. However, it is noted that it is

not  the  present  intention  of  the  Mainland  to  change  the  way  it  taxes  profits derived from this type of operation.    Nevertheless, the possibility that in future profits attributable to the permanent establishment may be taxed in accordance with the Comprehensive Arrangement cannot be ruled out.

## EFFECTIVE DATES AND APPLICABLE TEXT

8. The Comprehensive Arrangement entered into force on 8 December 2006. In  the  Mainland,  the  provisions  of  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement shall apply to income derived in taxable years beginning on or after 1 January 2007; and in Hong Kong, in years of assessment beginning on or after 1 April 2007. The exchange letters became effective on 11 September 2007 that was the  date  of  signature  and  the  Second  Protocol  became  effective  on  11  June 2008.
9. A  Hong  Kong  enterprise  may  adopt  the  end  date  of  a  year  of assessment  as  its  accounting  date,  i.e.  31  March,  or  any  other  date  falling within that year of assessment. The 'basis period' for the enterprise will be the year ending on the accounting date that falls within that year of assessment. The basis period for the year of assessment 2007/08 may therefore commence as early as 2 April 2006 (i.e. the period from 2 April 2006 to 1 April 2007 as the basis period for the year of assessment 2007/08).    Income derived during that  basis  period  will  be  dealt  with  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the Comprehensive Arrangement.
10. In  Hong Kong, since the policy of bilingual legislation is in place, both the English and the Chinese texts of the Comprehensive Arrangement are legally  binding. It  stands  to  reason,  however,  since  the  Comprehensive Arrangement  is  written  in  the  Chinese  language  only,  that  any  negotiation between the Mainland and Hong  Kong  on  the implementation of the Comprehensive  Arrangement  would  be  conducted  with  reference  to  the Chinese text.

11. The  stated  purpose  of  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement  is  for  the avoidance of double taxation in both Sides.    The Comprehensive Arrangement only  applies  to  persons  who  are  residents  of  One  Side  or  both  Sides. The terms 'resident of the Mainland' and 'resident of Hong Kong' are defined in paragraph 1 of Article 4.

## Article 2 TAXES COVERED

12. In contrast to the Limited Arrangement, the Comprehensive Arrangement  adds  property  tax  as  one  of  the  taxes  of  Hong  Kong  under  its coverage. More particularly, the existing taxes covered by the Comprehensive Arrangement are profits tax, salaries tax and property tax, whether or not the tax  is  charged  under  personal  assessment,  in  Hong  Kong;  and  individual income tax, foreign investment enterprises income tax and foreign enterprises income tax in the Mainland. According to Article 1 of the Second Protocol, in the  Mainland  the  existing  taxes  covered  by  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement starting  from  2008  are  individual  income  tax  and  enterprise  income  tax. Other taxes do not come within the scope of the Comprehensive Arrangement (except that business tax is included in the Mainland for the purposes of Article 8 of the Comprehensive Arrangement, see paragraph 67 below).
13. The  Comprehensive  Arrangement  applies  to  all  income  that  is subject  to  the  abovementioned  taxes,  including  taxes  on  gains  from  the alienation of movable and immovable property and taxes on capital appreciation. As such, receipts of capital nature come within the scope of the Comprehensive Arrangement. However, it is left to the domestic law of each Side to decide whether receipts of capital nature should be taxed.
14. The Comprehensive Arrangement will also apply to any identical or substantially  similar  taxes  that  are  imposed  after  the  date  of  signature  of  the Comprehensive Arrangement in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes as well as any other taxes falling within Article 2 which may be imposed in future.

## Article 3       GENERAL DEFINITIONS

15. To  facilitate  the  accurate  interpretation  and  implementation  of  the Comprehensive  Arrangement  by  both  Sides,  definitions  of  some  of  its  key terms have been included in Article 3.
16. The  term  'person'  has  been  defined  widely  in  the  Comprehensive Arrangement to include an individual, a company, a trust, a partnership and any other body of persons.
17. The term 'enterprise' applies to the carrying on of business activities of  any  form. The term 'business' includes the performance of professional services and other activities of an independent character. The terms 'enterprise of One Side' and 'enterprise of the Other Side' mean respectively 'an enterprise carried on by a resident of One Side', and 'an enterprise carried on by a resident of the Other Side'. An enterprise carried on by a resident includes an enterprise carried on by a resident company, a resident individual, a resident partnership, or a resident body of persons.
18. Paragraph 3 of Article 3 expressly states that as regards the application  of  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement  by  One  Side  (e.g.  tax  is imposed in  accordance  with  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement),  any  term  not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning which  it  has  at  the  time  of  the  application  under  the  laws  of  that  Side concerning the relevant taxes.

## Article 4 RESIDENT

19. In  view  of  the  differences  between  the  taxation  systems  in  the Mainland and Hong Kong, both Sides define the term 'resident of One Side' differently.

20. The  Mainland  basically  follows  the  Model  Tax  Convention  of  the OECD with its definition of the term 'resident of the Mainland' 1 . Since Hong Kong  adopts  a  territoriality  concept  of  taxation,  tax  is  only  imposed  upon income  derived  from  Hong  Kong.    No  one  is  liable  to  tax  in  Hong  Kong merely because of his resident status.    As such, Hong Kong is not in a position to adopt the definition provided in the OECD Model Tax Convention.    Instead, a  detailed  definition  of  'resident  of  Hong  Kong'  has  been  included  in  the Comprehensive Arrangement to enable taxpayers to ascertain whether they are entitled to the benefits of the Comprehensive Arrangement.    It should be noted, however,  that  the  definition  of  'resident  of  Hong  Kong'( 香港居民 )  in  the Comprehensive Arrangement is different from the meaning given to 'a resident person'( 居港者 ) in section 20AB of the Ordinance.    With regard to the latter, the Ordinance makes it clear that the meaning applies only to the interpretation of provisions relating to offshore funds.

## (I) Resident individual

21. In Hong Kong, a resident individual means:
- (1) an individual who ordinarily resides in Hong Kong;
- (2) an individual who stays in Hong Kong for more than 180 days during the relevant year of assessment or for more than 300 days in two consecutive years of assessment (one of which is the relevant year of assessment).
22. It  is  generally  considered  that  an  individual  'ordinarily  resides'  in Hong Kong if he has a permanent home in Hong Kong where he or his family lives. Other relevant factors include the duration of his stay in Hong Kong, whether he has a permanent place of residence in Hong Kong, whether he owns any  property  overseas  for  residential  purposes,  and  whether  he  is  primarily resident in Hong Kong or overseas.

According to Article 4(1) of the Comprehensive Arrangement and the amendment in Article 2 of the Second Protocol, in the Mainland 'resident of One Side' refers to any person who, under the laws  of  the  Mainland,  is  liable  to  tax  therein by reason of his/its  domicile,  residence,  place  of establishment, place of effective management or any other criterion of a similar nature. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in the Mainland in respect of income from sources in the Mainland. 1

23. In  calculating  the  180  or  300  days  of  stay  in  Hong  Kong,  an individual will be considered to be a Hong Kong resident if he stays in Hong Kong for a period or a number of periods amounting to more than 180 days in the relevant year of assessment, or for a period or periods amounting to more than  300  days  in  two  consecutive  years  of  assessment  (one  of  which  is  the relevant  year  of  assessment). However,  where  the  individual  concerned  is also a permanent resident of a third State and makes investment or carries on business in the Mainland, it is known that the Mainland will apply any treaty signed  between  China  and  the  State  of  which  that  individual  is  a  permanent resident. If there is no such treaty, the Mainland would consider to apply its relevant domestic laws.
24. Where,  under  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement,  an  individual  is  a resident  of  both  Sides,  his  status  will  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the order of priority set out in paragraph 2 of Article 4:
- (1) he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Side in which he  has  a  permanent  home  available  to  him;  if  he  has  a permanent home available to him in both Sides, he shall be deemed  to  be  a  resident  only  of  the  Side  with  which  his personal  and  economic  relations  are  closer  ('centre  of  vital interests');
- (2) if the Side in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be  determined,  or  if  he  does  not  have  a  permanent  home available  to  him  in  either  Side,  he  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a resident only of the Side in which he has an habitual abode;
- (3) if he has an habitual abode in both Sides or in neither of them, the competent authorities of both Sides shall resolve the issue by mutual agreement.
25. If  an  individual  who  is  a  resident  of  both  Sides,  but  deemed  in accordance with the abovementioned provisions to be a resident of Hong Kong, the tax authorities will treat him as a resident of Hong Kong when applying the provisions of the Comprehensive Arrangement. The term 'permanent home' in  paragraphs  22  and  24  above  refers  to  a  home  owned  or  possessed  by  an individual  that  is  permanent  in  nature. In  other  words,  this  home  must  be

retained  for  permanent  use  as  opposed  to  being  for  temporary  stays. If  the individual has a permanent home in both Sides concurrently, it is necessary to ascertain with which of the two Sides his personal and economic relations are closer. Regard will be had to his family and social relations; his occupations; his political, cultural and other activities; his place of business; and the place from  which  he  administers  his  property,  etc.    The  circumstances  must  be examined as a whole, but it is nevertheless obvious that considerations based on the personal acts of the individual must receive special attention.

## (II) Resident company

26. Where a company is incorporated in Hong Kong, or if incorporated outside Hong Kong is normally managed or controlled in Hong Kong, it will be considered to be a resident of Hong Kong under paragraph 1(2)(iii) of Article 4. A company incorporated in Hong Kong includes a company that is incorporated  as  a  legal  entity  in  accordance  with  the  Companies  Ordinance (Cap. 32) of Hong Kong.

27. The concept of 'normally managed or controlled in Hong Kong', as compared to that of 'central management and control' established in common law, has a broader meaning as it does not require that both management and control be exercised in Hong Kong. 'Management', in this context, refers to management of daily business operations, or implementation of the decisions made by top management, etc. 'Control', on the other hand, refers to control of the whole business at the top level, including formulating the central policy of  the  business,  making  strategic  policies  of  the  company,  choosing  business financing,  evaluating  business  performance,  etc.    The  board  of  directors usually exercises 'control'. In other words, if the business of the company is normally managed or controlled in Hong Kong, including the management of its  daily business operations, or the implementation of the decisions made by top  management,  or  the  making  of  top-level  policies,  in  Hong  Kong,  the company will be considered to be a resident of Hong Kong. The 'management'  or  'control'  of  a  company  may,  of  course,  be  conducted  in more than one place. However, so long as a company is normally managed or controlled in Hong Kong, it will be considered to be a resident of Hong Kong. If the Hong Kong branch of an overseas bank is managed in Hong Kong, the bank will be regarded as a resident of Hong Kong.    The Mainland, however, takes the view that in deciding whether an overseas bank is 'normally managed

or controlled in Hong Kong'; one should consider the management or control of the bank instead of that of the branch in Hong Kong only.    Hong Kong will continue to discuss with the Mainland on this point with a view to reaching a consensus.

28. While  the  term  'normally  managed  or  controlled'  has  a  broader meaning  than  that  of  'central  management  and  control',  in  principle,  a company will only be a resident of the place in which it actually exercises its business  operations  or  control. The  conclusion  is  wholly  one  of  fact. Regard will be had to factors such as the nature of business operated by the company,  mode  of  operation,  whether  it  has  a  permanent  office  or  employs staff  in  Hong Kong, and whether Hong Kong is the place where its board of directors meets to formulate policy.
29. Where  by  reason  of  the  definitions  adopted  by  both  Sides,  a company is a resident of both Sides, its resident status will be determined in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 4, that is, the company shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Side in which its place of effective management is situated.
30. The term 'place of effective management' refers to the place where key management and strategic decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the company's business are in substance made. Under normal circumstances, it  is  the  place  where  the  most  senior  persons  of  a  company  formulate  the direction  and  work  plans  of  the  company. A  company  can  have  only  one place of effective management at any one time.

## (III) Resident persons other than individuals and companies

31. It  is  stated  in  paragraph  1(2)(iv)  of  Article  4  that  any  other  person constituted under the laws of Hong Kong, or if constituted outside Hong Kong, being normally managed or controlled in Hong Kong, will be considered to be a  resident  of  Hong  Kong. In  Hong  Kong,  partnerships  are  the  mode  most likely to be encountered. In determining whether a trust, partnership or any other  body of persons is normally managed or controlled in Hong Kong, the criteria  are  the  same  as  those  adopted  in  determining  the  resident  status  of  a company.

## Certification of resident status

32. In applying the Comprehensive Arrangement, the tax authority of the Mainland  may  require  an  individual,  a  company,  or  a  body  of  persons  to produce  a  certificate  from  the  Hong  Kong  Inland  Revenue  Department certifying that the person is a 'resident' of Hong Kong.    This would generally only be required where there is a possibility that the person is a resident of both Sides,  or  there  is  a  need  to  verify  the  resident  status  of  the  person.    The relevant application forms and procedures are published on the Inland Revenue Department website ( www.ird.gov.hk ).
33. Upon receipt of an application, the Inland Revenue Department will examine the information supplied by the person, and if it is sufficient, issue a Certificate of Hong Kong Resident Status for the purposes of the Comprehensive  Arrangement  and  the  processing  time  normally  requires  21 working days. Where the evidence available is insufficient,  the  Department will request the applicant to supply the additional information required.
34. In  general,  for  a  company  that is  incorporated  in  Hong  Kong,  a Certified  Extract  of  Information  on  the  Business  Register  or  a  copy  of  the Certificate  of  Incorporation  of  the  company  is  sufficient  evidence.    An application for a Certified Extract of Information on the Business Register may be made online or in person.
35. On the other hand, where the Inland Revenue Department is unable to  ascertain  that  a  person  is  a  resident  of  the  Mainland  from  the  available information,  it  will  issue  a  letter  referring  the  person  to  the  Mainland  tax authorities  to  issue  a  certificate  of  resident  status  for  him. If  the  person  is unable to produce proof of his status, he will not be entitled to the benefits of the Comprehensive Arrangement.

## Article 5 PERMANENTESTABLISHMENT

## The concept of a permanent establishment

36. Three  criteria,  namely,  space  (a  fixed  place  of  business),  time (continuous or aggregate periods), and function (activities of a preparatory or

auxiliary character), are used to ascertain whether the activities of an enterprise of One  Side constitute a permanent establishment in the Other Side. Paragraph 1 of Article 5 generally explains that a permanent establishment is a fixed place of business through which the business activities of the enterprise are carried on.    There is no qualification on the scale or the form of the place of  business. A  permanent  establishment  will  normally  have  the  following features:

- (1) It must be a place of business. This may include a house, a site, equipment or facilities (such as machinery and equipment), a warehouse, and a stall used for carrying on the business  of  the  enterprise,  whether  owned  or  rented  by  the enterprise.
- (2) It  must be a fixed place of business with a certain degree of permanence.    The  temporary  interruption  or  suspension  of business activities conducted at a fixed place of business will not affect the existence of a permanent establishment.
- (3) The  enterprise  must  carry  on  the  whole  or  a  part  of  its business through this fixed place of business.
37. Paragraph 2 of Article 5 provides that the term 'permanent establishment' includes especially 'a place of management; a branch; an office; a factory; a workshop; a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources'. It is clear  from  the  words  'includes especially' that the paragraph does not preclude the determination of any other place of business as a permanent establishment in accordance with the general definition  of  the  term. It  should  be  noted  that  the  'place  of  management' mentioned in the list refers to a place of work or an office where some of the supervisory activities for an enterprise may be exercised. This is in contrast to the  criteria  in  Article  4,  i.e.  the  'normally  managed  or  controlled  in  Hong Kong' criterion used for determining whether a person is a Hong Kong resident; the 'head office' criterion used for determining whether a person is a resident of  the  Mainland  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  the  Second  Protocol;  and  the 'place of effective management' criterion used for resolving the issue of dual residence of both Sides. Paragraph 7 of Article 5 is also pertinent, providing that  the  fact  that  a  company  which  is  a  resident  of  One  Side  controls  or  is

controlled by a company which is a resident of the Other Side, or which carries on business in that  Other  Side,  will  not  of  itself  constitute  either  company  a permanent establishment of the other.

## A building site, a construction, assembly or installation project

38. The term 'permanent establishment' also includes 'a building site, a construction,  assembly  or  installation  project  or supervisory  activities in connection therewith, but only if such site, project or activities last more than 6 months'. The  Ordinance  imposes  tax  on  income  derived  from  contracting work carried out in Hong Kong in accordance with the territoriality principle. The duration of the work is not a relevant factor. However, pursuant to the Comprehensive Arrangement, chargeability of profits in respect of contracting work  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong  by  an  enterprise  of  the  Mainland  will  be governed by the duration of the work. An enterprise of the Mainland will be deemed  to  have  a  permanent  establishment  in  Hong  Kong  only  if  the contracting  work  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong  lasts  more  than  six  months. Profits attributed to that permanent establishment will be subject to tax in Hong Kong  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Article  7  (Business  Profits)  (see paragraphs 55 to 66 below). Profits in respect of contracting work of a shorter duration will not be subject to tax in Hong Kong. Similarly, an enterprise of Hong Kong will not be regarded as having a permanent establishment in the Mainland if contracting work carried out in the Mainland does not last more than six months and accordingly will not be subject to tax there.

39. The period for which a project is carried out is counted from the date the contractor commences work (including any preparatory activities) up until the date on which the work is totally completed and handed over to the user. If  the  period  covers  two  years,  the  period  is  counted  on  a  continuous  basis straddling over the years in question. In  a  case  where  two  or  more sub-projects  are  contracted  for  by  a  person  at  the  same  site  or  for  the  same project,  the  period  is  counted  from  the  date  of  commencement  of  the  first sub-project to the date of completion of the last sub-project of that person. In other  words,  the  respective  sub-projects  would  not  be  counted  separately. 'Two  or  more  sub-projects  contracted  for  at  the  same  site  or  for  the  same project' refers to sub-projects that would form a coherent whole commercially and geographically.    Where sub-projects are situated at different localities and are contracted for in relation to different projects, the respective periods would

be counted separately. In such a case a permanent establishment would not be considered to exist in relation to a particular sub-project if it does not last more than 6 months. A project that does not last more than 6 months would not be regarded as a permanent establishment even if another project of the enterprise constitutes a permanent establishment.

40. Where, after the commencement of work, a project is suspended (but not  terminated  or  ended)  pending,  for  example,  the  arrival  of  equipment  and materials or because of bad weather, and the persons, equipment and facilities as well as materials involved have not been completely moved out, the duration of  the  project  will,  in  such  a  case,  be  counted  continuously  without  any deduction for the days on which the project is suspended.
41. If the enterprise subcontracts part of a project to a subcontractor who commences work earlier than the contractor, then in accordance with paragraph 39 above, the duration of the entire project would be counted from the date the subcontractor  commences  work  up  to  the  date  on  which  the  work  is  totally completed and handed over to the user. This method of counting the project period does not affect the separate and independent calculation of the duration of  continuous  work  by  the  subcontractor.    Where  a  subcontractor  is  an enterprise  of  the  Mainland,  its  subcontracted  work  in  Hong  Kong  will  not constitute a permanent establishment if it does not last more than six months. In  such  a  case,  exemption  from  profits  tax  in  Hong  Kong  would  be  granted under  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement  to  the  subcontractor.    On  the  other hand, if the subcontractor is a resident of Hong Kong operating in the Mainland, exemption  from  tax  in  the  Mainland  would  likewise  be  granted  under  the Comprehensive Arrangement.

## Provision of services by an enterprise

42. A permanent establishment also includes 'the furnishing of services, including consultancy services, by an enterprise of One Side in the Other Side, directly or through employees or other personnel engaged by the enterprise, but only if such services continue (for the same or a connected project) for a period or periods aggregating more than 6 months within any 12-month period'. The scope of consultancy services includes:

- (1) improvement  of  existing  production  facilities  and  products, selection of technical know-how, or enhancement of supervisory and management skills, etc.;
- (2) feasibility  studies  of  investment  projects  and  selection  of design plans.

43. The  counting  of  'a  period  or  periods  aggregating  more  than  6 months within any 12-month period' may commence with any month during the  course  of  a  service  contract. Where services have been furnished by an enterprise directly or through employees or other personnel in the Other Side for  a  continuous  or  cumulative  period  of  more  than  6  months  within  any 12-month  period,  the  enterprise  will  be  considered  to  have  a  permanent establishment in the Other Side. Profits attributed to that permanent establishment will be subject to tax in the Other Side in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 (Business Profits) (see paragraphs 55 to 66 below). In the determination of whether a Mainland enterprise furnishing services should be regarded as having a permanent establishment in Hong Kong, the criterion is whether services are furnished by the enterprise directly (e.g. a sole-proprietor) or  through  employees  or  other  personnel  in  Hong  Kong  for  a  continuous  or cumulative  period  of  more  than  6  months  (within  any  12-month  period). There is no definition of the term 'month' in the Comprehensive Arrangement. The Commentary  of  the United Nations Model  has not given further explanations of the relevant provision and has not specified clearly how the 6 months are to be counted. Hence the Mainland and Hong Kong have adopted different counting methods. The Mainland considers that since only 'month' is  provided as a counting unit under the Comprehensive Arrangement, she is entitled  not  to  consider  the  number  of  days  in  its  implementation.    The Mainland adopts the following method of counting the months: the Mainland will  take  the  period  from  the  month  in  which  an  employee  of  a  Hong  Kong enterprise arrived in the Mainland for furnishing services up until the month in which the  project  was  completed  and  the  employee  left  the  Mainland  as  the relevant period. If during this relevant period, no service was provided by the employee in the Mainland for a period of 30 consecutive days, 1 month can be deducted. If it results in more than 6 months by using this counting method, the Hong Kong enterprise will be considered to have a permanent establishment  in  the  Mainland.    For  a  project  that  lasts  for  more  than  12 months,  any  12-month  period  commencing  from  the  month  the  employee

arriving in the Mainland or ending in the month leaving the Mainland during the  course  of  the  project  shall  be  adopted  for  the  purposes  of  applying  the counting  method.    In  Hong  Kong,  the  term  'month'  is  defined  in  the Interpretation  and  General  Clauses  Ordinance  (Cap.  1)  as  'calendar  month'. In  its  ordinary  meaning,  month  (calendar  month)  means  a  period  of  time between the same dates in successive calendar months; a period of around 30 days  (365  days  divided  by  12);  a  period  of  28  days  or  a  period  of  4  weeks. For the purposes of paragraph 3(2) of Article 5, Hong Kong considers that the term  'month'  to  be  a  period  of  30  days.  In  counting  whether  a  Mainland enterprise  has  furnished  services  in  Hong  Kong  'for  a  period  or  periods aggregating more than 6 months within any 12-month period', Hong Kong will add together each time period that services have been provided in Hong Kong by the  Mainland enterprise  directly  or  through  its  employees  (irrespective  of the length of the time period) within any 12-month period. If the cumulative number of days during the time period or time periods during which services have been provided in Hong Kong within that 12-month period exceeds 180 days, Hong Kong would consider that the Mainland enterprise has a permanent establishment  in  Hong  Kong. With  effect  from  11  June  2008,  the  term  '6 months'  was  repealed  and  substituted  by  '183  days'  under  Article  3  of  the Second  Protocol. In other words, if within any 12-month  period  the cumulative number of days during which services have been provided by an enterprise of One Side in the Other Side exceeds 183 days, that enterprise will be regarded as having a permanent establishment in the Other Side. For the transitional  arrangement,  Hong  Kong  agreed  with  the  Mainland  that  the  new '183 days' rule will only apply to those services which commenced after, and for which the employees rendering such services arrived at Hong Kong after, the  effective  date  of  the  Second  Protocol. For those enterprises which have commenced to provide services in Hong Kong prior to the effective date of the Second  Protocol,  the  original '6 months'  rule  will still be adopted  in determining whether they have a permanent establishment in Hong Kong.

Whilst  the  method  of  counting  the  '183  days'  was  not  stated  in  the  Second Protocol,  both  Sides  will  in  practice  use  the  'days  of  physical  presence' method. The  day  when  one  is  in  the  Other  Side,  and  the  day  of  arrival  or departure,  irrespective  of  the  duration  and  the  purpose  of  the  stay,  will  be counted as one day. This is because it is difficult if not impossible for the tax authority  to  ascertain,  and  for  the  taxpayers  to  prove,  whether  services  were rendered on any particular day of presence in the jurisdictions concerned.

## The place where preparatory or auxiliary activities are conducted

44. In defining a permanent establishment, the Comprehensive Arrangement  excludes  a  fixed  place  of  business  whose  activities,  for  the enterprise, are purely of a preparatory or auxiliary character. This is because such activities,  even  if  carried  on  through  a  fixed  place  of  business,  are  of  a preparatory  or  auxiliary  character  and  do  not  themselves  directly  generate profits.
45. Paragraph 4 of Article 5 lists  various  activities  of  a  preparatory  or auxiliary character that may  be carried out for the enterprise without constituting a permanent establishment.    They include:
- (1) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;
- (2) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery;
- (3) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to  the  enterprise  solely  for  the  purpose  of  processing  by another enterprise;
- (4) the  maintenance  of  a  fixed  place  of  business  solely  for  the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise, or of collecting information, for the enterprise;
- (5) the  maintenance  of  a  fixed  place  of  business  solely  for  the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character;
- (6) the  maintenance  of  a  fixed  place  of  business  solely  for  any combination of the activities mentioned in subparagraphs (1) to  (5)  above,  provided  that  the  overall  activity  of  the  fixed place  of  business  resulting  from  this  combination  is  of  a preparatory or auxiliary character.

46. The  purpose  of  paragraph  4  of Article  5  is  to  clarify  what  are accepted  as  genuine  'representative  offices'  and  not  regarded  as  permanent establishments  subject  to  tax.    However,  attention  should  be  drawn  to  the following:
- (1) the activities should be for the enterprise itself;
- (2) the activities should not directly generate profits; and
- (3) the  function  of  the  place  of  business  should  only  be  of  a supportive nature. If  the  place  of  business  conducts certain supervisory management  functions for the enterprise or manages certain business operations, its activities would not be regarded as being of the required character.    In this event, the  place  of  business  would  be  regarded  as  a  place  of management  and  would  therefore  constitute  a  permanent establishment.

Where the activities carried out in the Other Side by a representative office go beyond the exceptions set out in paragraph 4 of Article 5, the representative office would be regarded as a permanent establishment.    Profits attributed to that permanent establishment would be taxed in the Other Side in accordance with  the  provisions  of  Article  7  (Business  Profits)  (see  paragraphs  55  to  66 below).

## Business agent

47. Paragraph 5 of Article  5  of  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement expressly  points  out  that  a  dependent  agent  (i.e.  an  agent  acting  under  the control  and  leadership  of  an  enterprise  of  One  Side),  who  regularly  acts  on behalf of that enterprise in the Other Side and has, and habitually exercises, an authority  to  conclude  contracts  in  the  name  of  that  enterprise,  that  enterprise will be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the Other Side. In Hong Kong, if a dependent agent is not a final signatory to a contract but participates in detailed negotiations and formulates the contract provisions on behalf of the relevant Mainland enterprise, that Mainland enterprise will still be deemed to have  a  permanent  establishment  in  Hong  Kong. Paragraph  6  of  Article  5 states that an enterprise of One Side will not be deemed to have a permanent

establishment in the Other Side if its activities in that Other Side are conducted through  an  independent  agent  who  is  acting  in  the  ordinary  course  of  its business. However, when the activities of such an agent are wholly or almost wholly performed on behalf of that enterprise, he would not be regarded as an independent agent. The scope of his duties and responsibilities and whether he  has  the  right  to  conclude  contracts  on  behalf  of  the  enterprise  would determine whether or not that enterprise has a permanent establishment in that Other Side.

## Article 6 INCOME FROM IMMOVABLE PROPERTY

48. 'Income from immovable property' means the income derived from the use of immovable property without transfer of ownership. Income derived from alienation of immovable property will be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 (Capital Gains).
49. It  is  specifically  provided  in  paragraph  1  of  Article  6  that  income derived by a resident of One Side from immovable property (including income from agriculture  or  forestry)  situated  in  the  Other  Side  may  be  taxed  in  that Other Side.
50. According  to  the  elaboration  in  paragraph  3  of  Article  6,  income derived from immovable property may be income derived from the direct use of  immovable property by the owner, such as running a farm or carrying on animal husbandry, or income derived from letting or use in any other form of immovable property.
51. To avoid possible disputes over differences in interpretation, the term 'immovable property' is given the meaning which it has under the laws of the Side in which the property in question is situated. In Hong Kong, under the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 1), 'immovable property' means:
- (1) land, whether covered by water or not;
- (2) any estate, right, interest or easement in or over any land; and

- (3) things  attached  to  land  or  permanently  fastened  to  anything attached to land.
52. Apart from defining the meaning of immovable property according to the respective laws of each Side, it is specifically provided in paragraph 2 of Article 6 that certain assets and rights must always be regarded as immovable property. These  assets  and  rights  include  property  accessory  to  immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, and rights to which the provisions of general laws in respect of real estate apply. However, ships and aircraft shall never be regarded as immovable property.
53. The term 'property accessory to immovable property' does not mean a simple storage in or in connection with immovable property, but refers to a component part of an essential function of the immovable property, such as an air-conditioning system or elevator of a building.
54. Paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article 6 also apply to income derived by an enterprise  from  immovable  property. According  to  the  rules  set  out  above, income derived by an enterprise of One Side from immovable property situated in the Other Side may be taxed in that Other Side, regardless of whether it has a permanent establishment in that Other Side, whether the immovable property is part of that permanent establishment, or whether the income is derived through that permanent establishment.

## Article 7 BUSINESS PROFITS

## Allocation of taxing rights

55. Business  profits  refer  to  profits  derived  by  an  enterprise  from  its business  activities.    Under  the  provisions  of  paragraph  1  of  Article  7,  the profits of an enterprise of One Side shall be taxable only in that Side (i.e. the Other Side has no right to tax) unless the enterprise carries on business in the Other Side through a permanent establishment situated therein, in which case its  profits  may  be  taxed  in  that  Other  Side,  but  only  so  much  of  them  as  is attributable to that permanent establishment.

## Computation of business profits

56. The  Comprehensive  Arrangement  does  not  expressly  specify  the method  for  computing  business  profits,  but  instead  sets  out  some  principles which must be followed. Both Sides may compute profits in accordance with their  own  relevant  domestic  law,  provided  that  such  principles  are  followed. In Hong Kong, assessable profits are based on profits computed by enterprises in accordance with the prevailing generally accepted principles of commercial accounting as adjusted in conformity with the provisions of the Ordinance.
57. The principles stipulated in the Comprehensive Arrangement are set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 7. Paragraph 2 stipulates that a permanent establishment  will  be  considered  as  a  distinct  and  separate  enterprise,  while paragraph 3 contains provisions in relation to the deduction of expenses and the treatment of income.
58. Where a permanent establishment situated in the Other Side carries on business with the head office or other offices of the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment, it should do so in accordance with the arm's length principle as between two entirely independent enterprises engaged in the same or similar activities. There will in each Side be attributed to that permanent establishment  the  profits  which  it  might  be  expected  to  make  under  such conditions. For information concerning transfer pricing and the arm's length principle,  see  the  relevant  Departmental  Interpretation  and  Practice  Notes issued by the Inland Revenue Department.
59. In computing the profits of a permanent establishment, there will be allowed as deductions expenses (wherever incurred) that are incurred for the purposes  of  producing  the  relevant  profits,  including  executive  and  general administrative  expenses  so  incurred  (including  a  reasonable  share  of  the administrative expenses of the head office). Relevant expenses which can be clearly attributed to that permanent establishment can be deducted. Otherwise, an allocation of the relevant expenses should be made. The allocation can be based  on  the  proportion  of  the  business  turnover  or  gross  profit  of  the permanent establishment to that of the enterprise. The resultant expenses will be considered as the expenses actually incurred by the permanent establishment, though possibly not the amount actually paid by it.

60. A permanent establishment and its head office are one and the same legal entity. Therefore, a permanent establishment should not pay any amount to  the  head  office  for  its  investments  or  services. Paragraph  3  of  Article  7 specifically sets out three categories of amounts which will not be deducted in determining the profits of a permanent establishment, whether they are paid to the  head  office  of  the  enterprise  or  any  of  its  other  offices  (other  than reimbursement of actual expenses):
- (1) by  way  of  royalties,  remuneration,  fees  or  any  other  similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights; or
- (2) by way of commission for specific services performed or for management; or
- (3) by way of interest on moneys lent to the permanent establishment, except in the case of a banking enterprise, i.e. relevant interest is deductible in such a case.
61. Likewise,  the  above  provisions  will  also  apply  to  the  income  of  a permanent  establishment,  i.e.  the  amounts  falling  within  the  above  three categories  (other  than  reimbursement  of  actual  expenses)  charged  by  the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices would not be included in determining its profits, except that in the case of  a  banking  enterprise  the  relevant  interest  income  would  be  included  in determining the profits of the permanent establishment.

## Other methods of computing profits

62. If the financial statements prepared by an enterprise can give a true view of the state of affairs of the permanent establishment, they should be used to determine the profits attributed to that permanent establishment.    However, insofar  as  it  has  been  customary  in  One  Side  to  determine  the  profits  to  be attributed to a permanent establishment by apportioning the total profits of the enterprise to its various units or by any other methods provided for in the laws of  the  Side  concerned,  the  enterprise  may  continue  using  that  method. However, the  result  of  using  such  a  method  must  be  in  accordance  with  the principles contained in Article 7.

63. For banks and other persons whose head offices are situated outside Hong Kong, Rules 3 and 5 of the Inland Revenue Rules provide methods for determining  the  profits  of  their  branches  and  permanent  establishments 2 in Hong  Kong.    Those  methods  are,  however,  only  applicable  where  the financial  statements  of  the  branches  and  permanent  establishments  in  Hong Kong do not disclose their true profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong.
- (1) Under Rule 3, the same proportion of the total profits of the bank as the assets of the Hong Kong branch bear to the total assets  of  the  bank  would  be  treated  as  profits  of  the  Hong Kong  branch. For  the  purposes  of  determining  the  total profits  of  the  bank,  similar  adjustments  for  tax  purposes would  be  made  in  the  accounts  of  the  bank  as  would  have been necessary had the whole of those profits been liable to tax  under  the  Ordinance. If  the  assessor  is  of  the  opinion that  the  above  method  would  be  inappropriate,  he  may estimate the amount of the profits of the Hong Kong branch.
- (2) Under Rule 5, the same proportion of the total profits of the enterprise  as  the  turnover  in  Hong  Kong  bears  to  the  total turnover  of  the  enterprise  would  be  treated  as  profits  of  the permanent establishment in Hong Kong. For the purposes of determining the total profits of the enterprise, similar adjustments for tax purposes would be made in the accounts of the enterprise as would have been necessary had the whole of those profits been liable to tax under the Ordinance. If the assessor  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  above  method  would  be inappropriate,  he  may  compute  the  amount  of  the  profits derived from Hong Kong on a fair percentage of the turnover in Hong Kong.

## Other principles

64. Paragraph 5 of Article 7 of the Comprehensive Arrangement stipulates that no profits will be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the

'Permanent establishment' for the purposes of Rule 5 is defined to mean a 'branch, management or  other  place  of  business,  but does  not  include  an  agency  unless  the  agent has,  and  habitually exercises, a general authority to negotiate and conclude contracts on behalf of his principal or has a stock of merchandise from which he regularly fills orders on his behalf'. 2

mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. This is because purchasing activities do not directly generate profits in the overall business activities. In fact, it is very difficult to compute the  part  of  the  total  business  profits  that  is  attributable  to  such  purchasing activities.

65. The profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment must be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason  for  a  change. More  particularly,  the  method  should  not  be  changed merely because some other method would produce more favourable results.
66. 'Business  profits'  may  include,  apart  from  profits  derived  from business  activities,  income  such  as  that  from  immovable  property,  dividends and interest. The taxation of these categories of income is governed by other Articles  of  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement. To  clarify  the  application  of Article  7  in  relation  to  other  Articles,  paragraph  7  of  Article  7  provides  that where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles  of  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement,  then  the  provisions  of  those Articles will not be affected by the provisions of Article 7. It should be noted, however,  that  some  Articles  contain  provisions  stating  that  the  provisions  of Article 7 shall apply if the relevant property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment. Those provisions are paragraph 4 of Article 10, paragraph 5 of Article 11, paragraph 4 of Article 12, and paragraph 2 of Article 20.

## Article 8 SHIPPING, AIR AND LAND TRANSPORT

67. Article 8 provides that revenue and profits derived by an enterprise of One Side (i.e. an enterprise of the Mainland or an enterprise of Hong Kong) from the operation of ships, aircraft or land transport vehicles in shipping, air and land transport businesses (except when the ship, aircraft or land transport vehicle is  operated  solely  between  places  in  the  Other  Side)  shall  be  exempt from  tax  in  the  Other  Side. The  taxes  exempted  in  the  Mainland  include enterprise income tax and business tax. Enterprise income tax is calculated by reference to profits whereas business tax is calculated by reference to revenue. Accordingly, the Article specifically includes revenue and profits in the scope of the exemption. Revenue and profits refer to revenue and profits derived by

an  enterprise  from  cross-border  shipping,  air  and  land  transport  businesses. Revenue  and  profits  of  an  enterprise  derived  from  services  provided  in  the Other Side (other than those from cross-border shipping, air and land transport) will not be exempt in that Other Side if such services are provided through a permanent establishment situated in that Other Side. This Article also applies to revenue and profits derived from participation in a partnership business, joint venture business or international business agency.

## Shipping transport

68. Under Article 8, profits derived by a Hong Kong shipping enterprise from its shipping business will be taxed in Hong Kong alone. In this regard, the exercise of the taxing rights is subject to the provisions of section 23B of the Ordinance. For example, where an enterprise is deemed to be carrying on a business in Hong Kong as an owner of ships, 'relevant sums' (as defined in section 23B(12)) does not include any sums derived from any relevant carriage shipped  aboard  a  'registered  ship'  (as  defined  in  section  23B(12))  at  any location  within  the  waters  of  Hong  Kong  and  proceeding  to  sea  therefrom. The ratio of the relevant sums to the total shipping revenue is used to apportion the worldwide shipping profits of the Hong Kong ship-owner and calculate the assessable shipping profits derived from Hong Kong. Accordingly any sums from relevant carriage shipped aboard a registered ship at any location within the  waters  of  Hong  Kong  and  proceeding  to  sea  therefrom  by  a  Hong  Kong shipping enterprise will continue to be exempt from tax in Hong Kong.

## Air transport

69. Likewise,  profits  derived  by  a  Hong  Kong  air  transport  enterprise from its air transport business will be taxed in Hong Kong alone. According to section 23C of the Ordinance, 'relevant sums' (as defined in section 23C (5)) includes any sums derived from any relevant carriage shipped in Hong Kong and any relevant charter hire. The proportion of the relevant sums to the total revenue is used to apportion worldwide aircraft profits and calculate assessable aircraft profits derived from Hong Kong. By virtue of section 23C(2A), sums from relevant carriage and charter hire from the Mainland derived by a Hong Kong air transport enterprise, that are exempt from tax in the Mainland under the Comprehensive Arrangement, are included as relevant sums in calculating profits chargeable to profits tax in Hong Kong.

## Land transport

70. Article 8 is  regarded  as  having  application  to  a  Hong  Kong enterprise  that  carries  on  a  business  of  land  transport.    A  land  transport business  is  subject  to  tax  under  section  14  of  the  Ordinance. That  is,  any person who carries on a land transport business in Hong Kong is chargeable to tax on the profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong.
71. According to Article 8, a Hong Kong land transport enterprise will only  be  subject  to  tax  in  Hong  Kong  and  will  be  exempt  from  enterprise income tax and business tax in the Mainland. Similarly, revenue earned by a Mainland  land  transport  enterprise  from  Hong  Kong  uplifts  to  the  Mainland will be exempt from profits tax in Hong Kong.
72. A  cross-border  land  transport  business  between  the  Mainland  and Hong Kong usually takes the form of a cooperative enterprise. Typically the Hong Kong participant would make his investment in the form of vehicles and capital. The Mainland participant would be responsible for obtaining permits and  licences,  tax  compliance  and  other  management  services.    The  Hong Kong participant would be responsible for Hong Kong uplifts and the Mainland participant for uplifts in the  Mainland.    Occasionally,  the  Hong  Kong participant  could  enter  into  a  contract  with  the  customer  for  the  return  trip. This kind of cooperative enterprise is regarded as a joint business of cross-border  transport operated  by  residents of both  Sides. It follows, pursuant  to  paragraph  2  of  Article  8,  that  the  respective  shares  of  profits derived by each participant from the joint business operation would be exempt from  tax  by  the  Other  Side  and  would  be  taxed  in  the  Side  of  which  the participant is a resident in accordance with its taxation laws.

## Article 9 ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES

73. For the purpose of relieving its total tax burden, a cross-border group may,  by  means  of  altering  the  pricing  or  business  charges  (i.e.,  the  transfer pricing method), attempt to transfer the profits derived by an enterprise of the group from cross-border business activities to an associated enterprise. Article  9  provides  that  taxation  authorities  may  make  adjustments  to  profits where transactions between associated enterprises have not been entered into on an arm's length basis.

## Adjusting the profits of an enterprise of One Side

74. Paragraph 1 of Article 9 provides that in the following two different situations, if the commercial or financial relations between the two enterprises are  different  from  those  between  independent  enterprises,  any  profits  which would have accrued to one of the enterprises but have not done so by reason of those relations, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed as such. The two situations are:
- (1) an enterprise of One Side participates directly or indirectly in the  management,  control  or  capital  of  an  enterprise  of  the Other Side; or
- (2) the  same  person  participates  directly  or  indirectly  in  the management, control or capital of an enterprise of One Side and an enterprise of the Other Side.

## Making an appropriate adjustment to the profits of an enterprise of the Other Side

75. Under the provisions  of  paragraph  1  of  Article  9,  where  One  Side includes in the profits of an enterprise of that Side profits of an enterprise that have  been  charged  to  tax  in  the  Other  Side,  the  Other  Side  shall  make  an appropriate  adjustment  to  the  amount  of  the  tax  charged  on  those  profits  in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.
76. Insofar as Hong Kong is concerned, 'appropriate adjustment' means where the Inland Revenue Department agrees fully with the calculation of the Mainland, the Hong Kong enterprise can get an adjustment of the full amount; where the Department agrees with an amount less than that worked out by the Mainland,  the  Hong  Kong  enterprise  can  get  an  adjustment  of  that  smaller amount; where the Department disagrees with the Mainland on the adjustment, no adjustment will be made. The competent authorities of both Sides will, if necessary, consult each other in determining such adjustment.
77. The Hong Kong enterprise can present its case to the Inland Revenue Department  under  Article  23  (Mutual  Agreement  Procedure)  if  its  taxation treatment  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Comprehensive

Arrangement. The  competent  authorities  of  both  Sides  would  endeavour  to resolve  the  case  by  mutual  agreement.    However,  such  a  case  must  be presented  within  3  years  from  the  first  notification  of  the  action  resulting  in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Comprehensive Arrangement.

78. As  the  issue  of  transfer  pricing  arising  from  the  provisions  on 'associated enterprises' is complicated,  the  Inland  Revenue  Department intends  to  publish  a  Departmental  Interpretation  and  Practice  Note  on  the subject. The Note will provide information and guidance on the time limit for claims,  factors to be  taken  into  consideration  in  relation  to  appropriate adjustments, the tax adjustment methods, etc.

## INCOME  FROM  INVESTMENT  -  DIVIDENDS,  INTEREST  AND ROYALTIES

79. Income  derived  from investment  activities  is  indirect  or  passive income, and is different from profits from business activities. The taxation of such  income  (including  dividends,  interest  and  royalties)  is  governed  by specific Articles of the Comprehensive Arrangement.
80. Under the Comprehensive Arrangement, the key principle in relation to  business  profits  is  that  an  enterprise  of  One  Side  will  not  be  taxed  in  the Other Side unless it carries on business in that Other Side through a permanent establishment situated therein. On the other hand, if the enterprise does carry on  business  in  the  latter  manner,  the  profits  attributable  to  that  permanent establishment  may  be  taxed  in  that  Other  Side.    However,  for  investment income, the Side where the income arises has the taxing rights even if there is no permanent establishment situated therein.
81. Although the Side of the source of investment income has the taxing rights, this does not mean that the Side of which the recipient is a resident has no  taxing  rights. In  other  words,  both  the  Side  of  source  and  the  Side  of residence are given the right to tax the same item of investment income (the Side of residence is required to give double taxation relief to its residents for any income doubly taxed, see paragraphs 128 to 140 below). It is specifically stipulated  in  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement  that

the investment income should be taxed in the Side of source according to its laws. Thus, where the domestic laws of the Side of source provide tax relief or  special  tax  treatment,  the  Comprehensive Arrangement does not affect the application of such laws. In addition, the relevant provisions of the Comprehensive Arrangement set limits on the tax rates that the Side of source may  impose. More  particularly, notwithstanding  the provisions of  any domestic  laws  of  the  Side  of  source,  the  tax  imposed  on  investment  income derived by a resident of the Other Side ('beneficial owner' that satisfies the following  conditions)  should  not  exceed  the  amount  provided  for  in  the Comprehensive Arrangement.

82. The Side of source will only limit its right to tax if a condition is met: the beneficial owner of the investment income must be a resident of the Other Side. 'Beneficial owner' may be an individual, a company or a trust, and is the  person  who  actually  receives  the  benefit  and  fully  controls  the  income. For example, if the investment income is received by a unit trust, the beneficial owner is the unit trust itself, and is not the individual beneficiary of the unit trust. Where the recipient of the investment income does not actually receive the  economic  benefit  of  the  income  concerned,  but  only  collects  it  in  the capacity of an agent or a nominee and will subsequently transfer the income to the  actual  owner  in  accordance  with  a  contract  or  law,  such  an  agent  or  a nominee  will  not  be  deemed  to  be  the  beneficial  owner  of  the  income. In other words, even though an agent or a nominee is a resident of the Other Side, the Side of source need not apply the tax limitation if the beneficial owner is not a resident of the Other Side.
83. On the other hand, as long as the 'beneficial owner' is a resident of the  Other  Side,  the  limitation  of  tax  on  the  income  in  the  Side  of  source remains applicable, regardless of whether the agent or nominee is a resident of the Other Side at the time of the receipt of the relevant income.

## Article 10 DIVIDENDS

84. Paragraph 1 of Article 10 provides that dividends paid by a company which is a resident of One Side to a resident of the Other Side, may be taxed in that Other Side, that is, the Side of residence has the right to tax the dividends. The meaning of the term 'pay' is not limited to actual payment but will include

the fulfillment of the obligation to put funds at the disposal of the shareholder in the manner required by contract or by custom.

85. Paragraph 2 of Article 10 provides that such dividends may also be taxed in the Side of which the company paying the dividends is a resident (i.e. the Side of source) and according to the laws of that Side. The tax so charged, in 2 tiers, shall not exceed:
- (1) where the beneficial owner is a company directly owning at least  25%  of  the  capital  of  the  company  which  pays  the dividends, 5% of the gross amount of the dividends;
- (2) in any other case, 10% of the gross amount of the dividends.
86. As dividends are not chargeable to tax in Hong Kong, the limitation of tax rates has no practical application in Hong Kong.    It is also stipulated in paragraph 2 of Article 10 that the limitation of tax rates on dividends will not affect  the  taxation  of  the  company  in  respect  of  the  profits  out  of  which  the dividends are paid.
87. Paragraph  3  of  Article  10  defines  the  term  'dividends'  to  mean 'income  from  shares  or  other  rights,  not  being  debt-claims,  participating  in profits' and 'income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares under the laws of the Side of which the  company  making  the  distribution  is  a  resident'.    The  first  part  of  the meaning  makes  it  clear  that  the  relevant  income  must  be  derived  from shareholding rather than debt-claims. The second part links the definition to the laws of the Side of which the company paying the dividends is a resident.
88. The  provisions  of  Article  7  (Business  Profits)  shall  apply  if  the beneficial  owner  of  the  dividends,  being  a  resident  of  One  Side,  carries  on business  in  the  Other  Side  (of  which  the  company  paying  the  dividends  is  a resident) through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the shareholding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with that permanent establishment.
89. In  respect  of  the  taxation  on  dividends,  paragraph  5  of  Article  10 further provides that dividends paid by, or undistributed profits of, a company

which is a resident of One Side may not be taxed by the Other Side even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist of profits or income arising in  that  Other  Side. For  example,  where  a  Hong  Kong  resident  company carries on business through a permanent establishment situated in the Mainland and makes profits, the relevant profits may be taxed in the Mainland under the provisions  of  Article  7  (Business  Profits). When  the  Hong  Kong  resident company pays dividends out of its profits, the Mainland may not impose any tax on the dividends, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of the Mainland, or insofar as the shareholding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in the Mainland.

## Article 11 INTEREST

90. The taxation principles laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 11 are the same as those in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 10. What differs is that the  source  of  interest  is  'the  Side  in  which  the  interest  arises'. Under  the provisions of paragraph 6 of Article 11, interest will be deemed to arise in a Side when the payer is the Government of that Side, a local authority thereof or a resident of that Side. However, where the person paying the interest has in a Side a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which  the  interest  is  paid  was  incurred,  and  such  interest  is  borne  by  that permanent establishment, then such interest will be deemed to arise in the Side in which the permanent establishment is situated. In other words, the source of interest is the Side in which the payer who effectively bears the interest is situated.
91. The limitations of tax rates in the Side in which the interest arises are in 2 tiers as follows:
- (1) the tax charged will not exceed 7% of the gross amount of the interest, except in the following situation;
- (2) interest  is  exempt  from  tax  in  the  Side  of  source  if  it  is received  by  the  Government  of  the  Other  Side  or  any  other institutions mutually recognized by the competent authorities of both Sides. (Currently, the institutions mutually

recognized by the competent authorities of both Sides are: in the  case  of  the  Mainland,  China  Development  Bank,  The Export-Import Bank of China and Agricultural Development Bank of China, and with effect from 11 September 2007 the National Council for Social Security Fund and China Export &amp;  Credit  Insurance  Corporation;  and  in  the  case  of  Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.)

92. The term 'interest', as defined in paragraph 4 of Article 11, means 'income  from  debt-claims  of  every  kind,  whether  or  not  it  is  secured  by mortgage  or  whether  or  not  it  carries  a  right  to  participate  in  the  debtor's profits'  (i.e.  interest  is  limited  to  income  derived  from  debt-claims).    In addition, 'income from bonds, debentures and Government securities, including premiums  and  prizes attaching to such bonds, debentures or securities'  are  interest  within  the  meaning  of  the  definition.    Generally speaking,  the  difference  between  the  amount  paid  to  and  received  from  an issuing  institution  by  a  subscriber  is  the  interest  on  debentures.    Penalty charges for late payment will not be regarded as interest.
93. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Article 11 will not apply if  the  beneficial  owner  of  the  interest,  being  the  Government  of  One  Side,  a local  authority  thereof  or  a  resident  of  that  Side,  carries  on  business  in  the Other  Side  in  which  the  interest  arises  through  a  permanent  establishment situated  therein  and  the  debt-claim  in  respect  of  which  the  interest  is  paid  is effectively connected with that permanent establishment. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 (Business Profits) will apply.
94. In a situation of the kind provided for in paragraph 7 of Article 11, the provisions of Article 11 will have limited application. Such a situation is one where, by reason of a special relation between the payer and the beneficial owner  of  the  interest  or  between  both  of  them  and  some  other  person,  the amount of interest paid exceeds, for whatever reasons, the amount which would have  been  agreed  upon  in  the  absence  of  such  relation.  In  such  a  case,  the provisions  of  Article  11  will  apply  only  to  the  last-mentioned  amount. The excess part of the payments will remain taxable according to the laws of each Side, but due regard will still be had to the other provisions of the Comprehensive Arrangement.

95. As  Hong  Kong  only  taxes  interest  arising  in  Hong  Kong  from business carried on in Hong Kong, the limitation of tax rates does not have any practical application in Hong Kong.

## Article 12 ROYALTIES

96. The  provisions  of  Article  12  and  the  criteria  for  determining  the locality  of  the  source  are  the  same  as  those  for  Article  11. Regarding  the limitation  of  the  tax  rate,  it  is  7%  of  the  gross  amount  of  the  royalties  in  all cases.

97. The definition of 'royalties' as provided for in paragraph 3 of Article 12 is wide enough to cover the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), (ba) and (d) of section 15(1) of the Ordinance.
98. Where  a  resident  of  the  Mainland  receives  royalties  which  are deemed to be chargeable to tax under paragraphs (a), (b) and (ba) of section 15(1) of the Ordinance, the Mainland resident is taxed at the following rates by virtue of section 21A (1)(b):
- (1) corporations - at a tax rate of 17.5% (the tax rate for the year 2007/08 is 17.5%) on 30% of the gross amount, i.e. 5.25% of the gross amount;
- (2) persons other than corporations - at a tax rate of 16% (the tax rate for the year 2007/08 is 16%) on 30% of the gross amount, i.e. 4.8% of the gross amount.

Since the Comprehensive Arrangement has entered into force, as the applicable tax rate is 7% which is higher than the rates mentioned above, royalties arising in  Hong  Kong  and  paid  to  a  resident  of  the  Mainland  will  be  taxed  at  the effective  rate  (i.e.  5.25%  or  4.8%)  instead  of  the  rate  as  provided  for  in  the Comprehensive  Arrangement. However, if  royalties  arising  in  Hong  Kong and  paid  to  a  resident  of  the  Mainland  are  part  of  a  scheme  directed  at exploiting section 21A of the Ordinance, the Comprehensive Arrangement will not  prejudice  the  right  of  Hong  Kong  to  apply  its  laws  and  measures concerning tax avoidance (see paragraph 158 below).

99. Where  a  resident  of  the  Mainland  receives  royalties  which  are deemed to be chargeable to tax under section 15(1)(d) of the Ordinance (for example, hire charges for the use of or the right to use industrial, commercial and scientific equipment in Hong Kong), such a resident will be taxed subject to the provisions of the Comprehensive Arrangement as follows:

## Example 1

Company A,  a  resident  of  the  Mainland,  derives  from  Hong  Kong royalties of $900,000 during the year from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008. After  deduction  of  allowable  expenses  and  depreciation allowances  in  respect  of  the  relevant  equipment,  the  amount  of assessable  profits  of  Company  A is  $500,000  and  the  tax  payable thereon is $87,500 (i.e. 9.7% of the gross amount), calculated at the rate of 17.5% (the tax rate for the year 2007/08 is 17.5%).

As the tax rate provided for in the Comprehensive Arrangement is 7% of the gross amount of royalties (i.e. $900,000 x 7%), the tax payable by Company A will be reduced to $63,000.

## Example 2

Same as Example 1 except that the amount of assessable profits of Company A is $300,000 and the tax payable thereon is $52,500 (i.e. 5.8% of the gross amount), calculated at the rate of 17.5% (the tax rate for the year 2007/08 is 17.5%).

As the tax rate provided for in the Comprehensive Arrangement is 7%  of  the  gross  amount  of  royalties,  the  tax  payable  remains  as $52,500, unaffected by the Comprehensive Arrangement.

100. The provisions of Article 12 will not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being the Government of One Side, a local authority thereof or a resident  of  that  Side,  carries  on  business  in  the  Other  Side  in  which  the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with that permanent establishment. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 (Business Profits) will apply. In other words, if the  abovementioned

Mainland  residents  have  a  permanent  establishment  situated  in  Hong  Kong, and the right in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with that permanent establishment, the royalties concerned will be included in the computation of the profits of that permanent establishment. The profits of that permanent establishment will be taxed in accordance with the provisions of Article  7  (Business  Profits). The  limitation  of  tax  rate  as  provided  for  in Article 12 would have no application.

## Article 13 CAPITAL GAINS

101. Article 13 allocates the right of tax on the gains from the alienation of property. It should be noted that Article 13 does not distinguish as to the nature of the capital gains. Accordingly, 'capital gains' may include gains of a capital nature and gains of a revenue nature (speculative gains).
102. Paragraph 1 of Article 13 deals with gains derived by a resident of One Side from the alienation of immovable property situated in the Other Side. Paragraph  2  of  Article  13  deals  with  gains  derived  from  the  alienation  of movable  property  forming  part  of  the  business  property  of  a  permanent establishment which an enterprise of One Side has in the Other Side, including gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment.    Both paragraphs allow the Other Side to impose tax. This is consistent with the principle on the  allocation  of  taxing  rights  as  provided  for  in  Article  6  (Income  from Immovable  Property)  and  Article  7  (Business  Profits). The  term  'movable property' means  all property other than immovable  property, including intangible assets such as goodwill.
103. Gains  derived  by  an  enterprise  of  One  Side  from  the  alienation  of ships  or  aircraft  or  land  transport  vehicles  operated  in  shipping,  air  and  land transport or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships, aircraft or  land  transport  vehicles,  shall  be  taxable  only  in  that  Side  under  the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article 13. This is consistent with the principle on the allocation of taxing rights as provided for in Article 8 (Shipping, Air and Land Transport).
104. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 13 deal with gains derived from the alienation of shares in a company.

105. Under  the  provisions  of  paragraph  4  of  Article  13,  gains  derived from the alienation of shares in a company the assets of which are comprised, directly or indirectly, mainly of immovable property situated in One Side may be  taxed  in  that  Side. Both  Sides,  pursuant  to  paragraph  2  of  the  Protocol, take 50% as the benchmark in determining whether the assets of a company are comprised 'mainly' of immovable property. Where the value of immovable property is not less than 50% of the value of the total assets of a company, the assets of that company will be deemed to be comprised mainly of immovable property. In  calculating  the  value  of  the  total  assets  of  a  company,  debts  of that  company  (including  liabilities  secured  by  mortgages  on  the  relevant immovable property) must not be deducted. Both Sides hold different views as to the relevant point in time for deciding whether the value of immovable property equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the total assets of the company. Hong Kong holds the view that it means the time of the alienation of shares, whereas  the  Mainland  holds  the  view  that  it  means  any  time  in  the  period during  which  the  alienator  held  any  shares  in  the  company.    The  State Administration of Taxation has discussion with the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department and then concluded the  Second  Protocol. Both  Sides  agreed  to set a time frame of '3 years' for the purposes of deciding whether the value of immovable property equaled or exceeded 50% of the value of the total assets. Though  the  State  Administration  of  Taxation  has  not  adopted  Hong  Kong's interpretation,  the  specification  of  a  time  frame  has  already  provided  more certainty in the interpretation of this provision. Hong Kong would continue to discuss with the Mainland on this issue.

106. Before  the Second  Protocol  became  effective,  Hong  Kong  will calculate the value of assets on the basis of market value as at the time of the alienation  of  the  shares  concerned;  whereas  the  Mainland  will  calculate  the value on the basis of historical cost. In general, Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department  will  accept  the  last  available  audited  financial  statements  of  the company  whose  shares  are alienated, supplemented  by  its  management accounts up to the date of alienation of the shares (the latter may be unaudited), for the purposes of calculating the value of assets.    In the Mainland, the value of  assets  is  calculated  at  present  on  the  basis  of  historical  cost. The  State Administration  of  Taxation  has,  however,  agreed  that  notwithstanding  the different bases adopted by the two Sides for their respective calculations, where the calculation satisfies the taxing conditions and tax is imposed in both Sides, the Side of residence should give credit to its resident for income doubly taxed.

For  the  alienation  of  shares  on  or  after  11  June  2008  (effective  date  of  the Second Protocol), both Sides will calculate the value of assets by reference to the book value at the end of any of the 3 taxable years prior to the alienation. The  calculation  will  base  on  generally  accepted  accounting  standards  which include normal  depreciation and revaluation provisions. The  following example shows how the new calculation method is applied:

## Example 3

On  1  May  2004,  a  Mainland  resident  Mr.  Wong  bought  shares  in Company  B,  which  closed  its  accounts  annually  on  31  December. Company  B  held  immovable  properties  in  Hong  Kong,  with  the properties representing, as per the accounts at the end of the taxable year, the following percentages of total company assets:

(a) for 2004, 60%;

(b) for 2005, 40%;

(c) for 2006, 40%;

(d) for 2007, 40%.

Mr. Wong sold the shares of Company B on 23 June 2008 and made a profit.

The new rule will apply as the Second Protocol has become effective at the time of alienation, 23 June 2008. The book value at the end of  the  3  taxable  years  prior  to  the  alienation  will  be  used  in determining  whether  the  assets  of  Company  B  are  comprised 'mainly' of immovable  property. According  to the year-end accounts for 2005 to 2007, the immovable properties only accounted for  40%  of  the  total  assets  of  Company  B. Hence,  the  assets  of Company B were not at any time comprised 'mainly' of immovable property. According to paragraph 4 of Article 13 of the Comprehensive Arrangement, Hong Kong does not have the taxing rights on the gains on alienation received by Mr. Wong.

In Hong Kong, the taxable year refers to the period from 1 April to 31 March of the next year. Hence, strictly speaking the Department should  require  Company  B  to  provide  annual  accounts  as  at  31 March for each year from 2005 to 2007.    In general, the Department would adopt a more flexible approach and would accept the relevant

company's accounting year-end accounts (with the exception of tax planning cases).

107. Before the Second Protocol became effective, gains derived from the alienation of 'shares', other than shares referred to in paragraph 4 of Article 13, of  not  less  than  25%  of  the  entire  shareholding  of  a  company  which  is  a resident  of  One  Side  may  be  taxed  in  that  Side  under  the  provisions  of paragraph  5  of  Article  13.    Hong  Kong  interprets  the  word  'shares'  as referring to shares sold at the time of alienation, rather than the total shares in a company held or once held by the alienator. In other words, it is only when shares alienated are not less than 25% of the entire shareholding of a company may gains derived from the alienation be taxed in that Side. It is understood that the Mainland interprets '25%' as referring to 25% or more of the shares in a company once held by the alienator. That is, if shares representing 25% or more of the entire shareholding of a Mainland company were once held by a Hong  Kong  resident,  gains  derived  by  the  Hong  Kong  resident  from  the alienation of all or part of his/its shareholding may be taxed in the Mainland. After  negotiation,  the  State  Administration  of  Taxation  and  the  Hong  Kong Inland Revenue Department reached a consensus that the '25%' applied to the shares held by the alienator. Under the Second Protocol, both Sides agreed to set a time frame of 12 months for the purpose of deciding whether the alienator has 'once held' at least 25% of the shareholding.    However, the alienation of shares  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  the  Second  Protocol  (i.e.  11  June  2008) would not be affected by this new provision. According to Article 5 of the Second Protocol, gains derived by a resident of One Side from the alienation of shares in the capital of a company which is a resident of the Other Side may be taxed  in  that  Other  Side  if,  at  any  time  within  the  12  months  before  the alienation, the recipient of the gains had a participation, directly or indirectly, of not less than 25% of the capital of the company.

## Example 4

On 1 April 2006, a Mainland resident, Mr. Cheung, acquired 35% of the entire shareholding of a Hong Kong company, Company C. Mr.  Cheung  made  a  profit  in  selling  25%  and  10%  shares  of Company C on 1 May 2007 and 23 June 2008 respectively.

Paragraphs 1 to 4 of Article 13 of the Comprehensive Arrangement will not apply. However, Hong Kong has the taxing rights on Mr. Cheung's  gains  received  from  the  alienation  of  25%  shares  of Company C on 1 May 2007 (i.e. before the effective date of the Second Protocol), according to paragraph 5 of Article 13. Even though Hong Kong has the taxing rights, whether the gains would be taxed still depends on other factors, like whether the gains were capital or revenue in nature.

By the time Mr. Cheung sold the 10% shares of Company C on 23 June  2008  the  Second  Protocol  has  come  into  effect.    As  Mr. Cheung only had a participation of less than 25% of the capital of Company C during the 12 months prior to the alienation, his gains from the second sale of shares will not be subject to tax in Hong Kong according to the new rule under paragraph 5.

108. Gains  derived  from the  alienation  of  any  property,  other  than  that referred to in paragraphs 1 to 5 of Article 13, shall be taxable only in the Side of which the alienator is a resident.

## Article 14 INCOME FROM EMPLOYMENT

109. Paragraph  1  of  Article  14  provides  that  salaries,  wages  and  other similar  remuneration  derived  by  a  resident  of  One  Side  in  respect  of  an employment  shall  be  taxable  only  in  that  Side  unless  the  employment  is exercised in the Other Side. If the employment is exercised in the Other Side, such  remuneration  as  is  derived  therefrom  may  be  taxed  in  that  Other  Side. However,  remuneration  derived  by  a  resident  of  One  Side  in  respect  of  an employment exercised in the Other Side will be exempt from tax in that Other Side if all the following three conditions are satisfied:

- (1) the  recipient  is  present  in  the  Other  Side  for  a  period  or periods  not  exceeding  in  the  aggregate  183  days  in  any 12-month period commencing or ending in the taxable period concerned;

- (2) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the Other Side;
- (3) the  remuneration  is  not  borne  by  a  permanent  establishment which the employer has in the Other Side.

In  addition,  it  is  provided  in  paragraph  3  of  Article  14  that  remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship, an aircraft or a land  transport  vehicle  operated  in  shipping,  air  and  land  transport  by  an enterprise of One Side shall be taxable only in that Side.

## 'Present for not exceeding 183 days' exemption condition

110. Under  the  provisions  of  paragraph  2(1)  of  Article  14,  where  an employment is exercised by a resident of One Side in the Other Side, one of the conditions for tax exemption is satisfied only when he is present in the Other Side  for  a  period  or  periods  not  exceeding  in  the  aggregate  183  days  in  any 12-month  period  commencing  or  ending  in  the  taxable  period  concerned. 'Any 12-month period commencing or ending in the taxable period concerned' denotes  two  concepts,  namely,  that  the  number  of  days  of  presence  may straddle over 2 years, i.e. the days of presence can be calculated continuously or  in  the  aggregate  irrespective  of  the  year;  and  that  a  floating  calculation method may be adopted. The 12-month period can commence or end at any day within the taxable period concerned.    The taxable period in the Mainland is the calendar year, whereas the taxable period (i.e. the year of assessment) in Hong Kong is the period from 1 April to 31 March of the next year.

111. Take the year of assessment 2008/09 as an example, the time period that should be taken into account, based on the two concepts mentioned above, is  between  2  April  2007  and  30  March  2010. If  a  Mainland  resident  is  not present in Hong Kong for more than 183 days in any 12-month period in the time  period  identified  above,  he  has  met  the  'present  for  not  exceeding  183 days' exemption condition for the year of assessment 2008/09.    However, if the Mainland resident is present in Hong Kong for more than 183 days in any 12-month period in the time period identified above, remuneration derived by him  in  respect  of  the  employment  exercised  in  Hong  Kong  is  chargeable  to Hong Kong salaries tax for the year of assessment 2008/09.

112. In  the  year  when  Article  14  of  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement became effective (the year 2007 for the Mainland and the year of assessment 2007/08  for  Hong  Kong),  the  Mainland  adopts  1  January  2007  as  the commencement  date  for  the  purposes  of  ascertaining  the  number  of  days  a Hong Kong resident is present in the Mainland; whilst Hong Kong adopts 1 April  2007  as  the  commencement  date  for  the  purposes  of  ascertaining  the number of days a Mainland resident is present in Hong Kong.    In other words, in the first year of Article 14's application, the Mainland regards any 12-month period to be any 12-month period commencing in the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2007; and Hong Kong regards any 12-month period to be any 12-month period commencing in the period from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008.
113. The  'days  of  physical  presence'  method  is  adopted  in  deciding whether a resident is present in the Other Side for a period or periods exceeding 183 days.    Under this method, the day of arrival or departure and each day in the  period  during  which  he  stays  in  the  Other  Side,  however  brief  and  for whatever reasons, will be counted as one day respectively.

## Hong Kong residents working across the Mainland border

114.          If  a  resident  of  Hong Kong provides services both in the Mainland and in Hong Kong, the tax treatment in both Sides is as follows:

## (1) Tax liabilities in Hong Kong

- -the income derived from his Hong Kong employment will be  wholly  assessable  irrespective  of  whether  it  has  been paid by the Hong Kong employer or a Mainland establishment. However, if the Hong Kong resident has paid  individual  income  tax  in  respect  of  the  income attributable to services rendered by him in the Mainland, he may apply for tax exemption for that part of the income under section 8(1A)(c) of the Ordinance, or for a tax credit under the provisions of Article 21 of the Comprehensive Arrangement.    Application may be made on his tax return for the year of assessment concerned, and supported with evidence  of  the  Mainland  tax  payment.    In  general,  tax

exemption provides greater tax relief than that provided by tax credit. A Hong Kong resident who has declared and paid salaries tax on his employment income, and who has subsequently paid individual income tax on all or part of his  employment  income  in  the  Mainland  because  he  has rendered  services  there,  can  apply,  under  section  70A  of the Ordinance, to have his assessment revised in accordance with the provisions of section 8(1A)(c).

- -the income derived from his non-Hong Kong employment will be assessed according to the number of days in Hong Kong  irrespective  of  whether  it  has  been  paid  by  an overseas employer or a Mainland establishment, provided that his visit(s) to Hong Kong exceed 60 days and during which he renders services.

## (2) Tax liabilities in the Mainland

- -If,  under  his  employment,  a  Hong  Kong resident renders services in the Mainland  only (i.e. services are not rendered whilst in Hong Kong), all his income from that employment  will  be  regarded  as  attributable  to  services rendered in the Mainland. Such income  is wholly chargeable  to  Mainland  tax,  irrespective  of  whether  it  is paid by a Mainland establishment or an overseas employer (including a Hong Kong employer) unless he satisfies the three conditions mentioned in paragraph 109 above.
- -If,  under  his  employment,  a  Hong  Kong resident renders services both in the Mainland and in Hong Kong, and his aggregated periods of stay in the Mainland do not exceed 183 days, income paid or borne by the Mainland establishment will be chargeable to individual income tax. Tax will be calculated on the chargeable income and then apportioned  on  time  basis. Income paid by an overseas employer  (including a Hong  Kong  employer)  is  not chargeable.

- -If,  under  his  employment,  a  Hong  Kong  resident  renders services both in the Mainland and in Hong Kong, and his aggregated  periods  of  stay  in  the  Mainland  exceed  183 days, the total income received from the Mainland establishment and the overseas employer (including Hong Kong employer) will be chargeable to individual income tax. Tax will be calculated on the total income and then apportioned on time basis.

## (3) Counting of days of stay for calculating tax liabilities

- -For  tax  computation  purposes,  the  aggregated  periods  of stay in a year of assessment is the aggregate of the days in each period of stay where the number of days is counted under  the  rule  of  the  'days  of  physical  presence'  minus one day.
- -The Mainland and Hong Kong are geographically so close to  each  other  that  a  taxpayer  may  travel  between  the Mainland and Hong Kong on a particular day and provides services  in  both  Sides.    As  such,  it  is  not  appropriate  to apply  the  rule  of  the  'days  of  physical  presence'  minus one day.    However, serious double taxation could occur if both Sides apply the rule of 'days of physical presence'. To address such cases, the State Administration of Taxation and the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department have  reached  consensus.    If  a  taxpayer  travels  between the  Mainland  and  Hong  Kong  on  a  particular  day  and provides  services  in  both  Sides,  he  would  be  counted  as present in the Mainland for half a day and in Hong Kong for  half  a  day.    However,  if  he  only  provides  services either  in  the  Mainland  or  Hong  Kong  on  that  day,  he would be counted as having been present for one day in the Mainland or Hong Kong, as the case may be.

## Article 15 DIRECTORS' FEES

115. Article  15  provides  that  directors'  fees  and  other  similar  payments derived by a resident of One Side in his capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the Other Side may be taxed in that Other Side. In other words, directors' fees received by a resident of either Side in  his  capacity  as  a  director  of  a  company  may  be  taxed  in  the  Side  of which the company is a resident, irrespective of the period of his stay in either Side  or  the  place  where  the  services  are  actually  rendered.    Therefore, directors' fees derived by a Hong Kong resident in his capacity as a director of a  Mainland  company  will  all  be  subject  to  the  individual  income  tax  in  the Mainland. Likewise,  directors'  fees  derived  by  a  Mainland  resident  in  his capacity as a director of a Hong Kong company will all be subject to salaries tax  in  Hong  Kong. 'Directors'  fees  and  other  similar  payments'  include benefits in kind (such as share options, the use of a residence or car, health or life  insurance  coverage  and  club  memberships). 'Directors'  fees  and  other similar payments' do not include wages, salaries and other remunerations paid to  a  director  on  account  of  his  other  functions  with  the  company  (e.g.  as  an employee or consultant). Such wages, salaries and other remunerations will be  dealt  with  in  accordance  with  Article  14  (in  the  case  of  income  from employment) and Article 7 (in the case of business profits).

## Article 16 ARTISTES AND SPORTSPERSONS

116. Paragraph 1 of Article 16 provides that income derived by a resident of One Side as an entertainer, a musician or a sportsperson, from his personal activities as such exercised in the Other Side, may be taxed in that Other Side. A theatre artiste, a musician or a sportsperson who performs in the Other Side may derive substantial amounts of income, yet his stay may only be for a short period  of  time,  usually  not  exceeding  183  days. Therefore,  paragraph  1  of Article 16 provides that the relevant income may be taxed in the Side where his activities are exercised. In addition, paragraph 2 of Article 16 stipulates that income in respect of personal activities exercised by an artiste or a sportsperson may be taxed in the Side in which the activities are exercised, irrespective of whether the income accrues ultimately to the artiste or sportsperson himself or to another person (including a company or any other legal entity). This is to ensure that all income derived by an entertainer or a sportsperson in respect of

his  personal  activities  may  be  taxed  in  the  Side  in  which  the  activities  are exercised.

## Article 17 PENSIONS

117. Regarding pensions and other similar remuneration paid to a resident of  One  Side  in  consideration  of  past  employment,  Article  17  stipulates  a taxation principle that is different from that on which income from employment is taxed. The term 'pensions and other similar remuneration' includes annuities paid  in  respect  of  past  employment,  lump  sum  payments  in  lieu  of  pensions received  at  the  time  of  or  after  leaving  services,  sums  received  by  way  of commutation  of  pensions  and  pensions  received  by  widows  and  orphans. However,  Article  17  does  not  apply  to  a  lump  sum  payment  made  upon cessation  of  an  employment  or  termination  of  a  contract. Such  a  payment falls  within  the  meaning  of  income  from  employment  and  therefore  will  be taxed in accordance with the provisions of Article 14.
118. According to the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 17, pensions received  by  an  individual  shall  be  taxable  only  in  the  Side  of  which  the individual  is  a  resident,  except  that  government  pensions  will  be  taxed  in accordance  with  paragraph  2  of  Article  18.    Paragraph  2  of  Article  17  also stipulates  that  notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraph  1,  pensions  and other  payments  made  under  the  following  pension  schemes  shall  be  taxable only in the Side in which the schemes are implemented:
- (1) a  public  scheme  which  is  part  of  the  social  security  system implemented  by  the  Government  of  One  Side  or  a  local authority thereof;
- (2) an arrangement in which individuals may participate to secure retirement benefits and which is recognized for tax purposes in One Side.
119. According to the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 17, pensions and other similar payments made under a public scheme which is part of the social security system implemented in the Mainland shall be taxable only in the Mainland; whilst pensions and other similar payments made under a

'recognized retirement scheme' in Hong Kong shall be taxable only in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, a 'recognized retirement scheme' means a 'recognized occupational retirement scheme' and a 'mandatory provident fund scheme'.

## Article 18 GOVERNMENT SERVICE

120. According to the principle of Article 18, remuneration and pensions paid by the Government of One Side to an individual (other than an individual who is a resident of the Other Side and renders services in that Other Side) in respect of services rendered to that Government, in the discharge of government functions shall be taxable only in that Side.
121. There  are  three  paragraphs  in  Article  18. Paragraph  1  applies  to remuneration other than pensions. Sub-paragraph (1) states that salaries and wages paid by the Government of One Side or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government or authority, in the  discharge  of  government  functions,  shall  be  taxable  only  in  that  Side. Sub-paragraph (2) applies to cases which are exceptions to those covered by sub-paragraph (1). Sub-paragraph (2) stipulates that salaries and wages paid by the Government of One Side or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government or authority, in the discharge of government functions shall be taxable only in the Other Side if the services are rendered in that Other Side and the individual is a resident of that Other Side who  did  not  become  a  resident  of  that  Other  Side  by  reason  only  of  the rendering of such services. The expression 'a resident of that Other Side who did not become a resident of that Other Side by reason only of the rendering of such services' in sub-paragraph (2) refers to an individual who is originally a resident of that Other Side and does not become the resident of that Other Side only  because  he  is  employed  by  the  Government  of  One  Side  or  a  local authority thereof to render services in that Other Side.
122. For example, the income of a Hong Kong resident employed by the Hong Kong Government to work in its office in Beijing shall be taxable only in Hong Kong. On the other hand, the income of a Mainland resident employed by the Hong Kong Government to work in the Beijing office shall be taxable only in the Mainland. The income of a Mainland resident employed by the Central People's Government to work in the Hong Kong office shall be taxable

only in  the  Mainland. If  a  Hong  Kong  resident  is  employed  by  the  Central People's  Government  to  work  in  the  Hong  Kong  office,  his  income  shall  be taxable only in Hong Kong.

123. Paragraph  2  of  Article  18  applies  to  pensions  and  its  taxation principle is the same as that laid in paragraph 1.    The expression 'or paid out of  funds  created  or  contributed  as  employer'  in  sub-paragraph  (1)  makes  it clear  that  pensions  include  the  pensions  directly  paid  by  the  Government  of One Side or a local authority thereof and the pensions paid out of funds created or contributed as employer by the Government of One Side or a local authority thereof.    Sub-paragraph (2) provides for cases which are exceptions to those covered by sub-paragraph (1), which is the situation covered in sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 1, as stated in the foregoing paragraph 121 above.
124. Paragraph 3 of Article 18 states clearly that paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the services are rendered in connection with a business carried on by the Government of One Side or a local authority thereof. In such cases the ordinary  rules  apply:  Article  14  (Income  from  Employment)  for  salaries  and wages;  Article  15  (Directors'  Fees)  for  directors'  fees  and  other  similar payments;  Article  16  (Artistes  and  Sportspersons)  for  income  derived  by artistes  and  sportspersons;  and  Article  17  (Pensions)  for  pensions  and  other similar remuneration.

## Article 19 STUDENTS

125. Article 19 gives limited tax exemption to students so as to assist and nurture talents as well as to take care of students' living expenses. The Article provides  that  'payments  which  a  student  who  is  or  was  immediately  before visiting One Side a resident of the Other Side and who is present in the One Side  solely  for  the  purpose  of  his  education  receives  for  the  purpose  of  his maintenance and education shall not be taxed in that One Side, provided that such  payments  arise  from  sources  outside  that  One  Side.'    Qualifying payments  include  tuition  fees,  student  grants  and  scholarships  from  sources outside that One Side.

## Article 20 OTHER INCOME

126. Article 20 is written by reference to the United Nations Model. It provides that items of income of a resident of One Side, wherever arising, not dealt with in the Articles of the Comprehensive Arrangement shall be taxable only  in  that  Side. However,  the  abovementioned  income,  if  arising  in  the Other Side, may also be taxed in that Other Side.
127. Article  20  also  provides  that  the  provisions  of  Article  7  (Business Profits) shall apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined  in  paragraph  2  of  Article  6,  if  the  recipient  of  such  income,  being  a resident of One Side, carries on business in the Other Side through a permanent establishment situated therein and a right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.

## Article 21 METHODS FOR ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION

128. Under the Comprehensive Arrangement, both Sides eliminate double taxation by the allowance of a tax credit. In accordance with the provisions of the Comprehensive Arrangement, Mainland tax paid in the Mainland in respect of any item of income derived by a resident of Hong Kong will be allowed as a credit  against  the  Hong  Kong  tax  payable  on  that  income  by  that  resident. However, the amount of tax credit will not exceed the amount of tax payable in respect of that item of income, computed in accordance with the provisions of the Ordinance.
129. In  processing  an  application  for  tax  credit,  One  Side  will  consider whether the relevant tax is imposed by the Other Side under the laws of that Other  Side  (and  such  laws  being  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the Comprehensive Arrangement). A tax credit will be granted only if the answer is in the affirmative.
130. The  Comprehensive  Arrangement  provides  that  the  method  for elimination  of  double  taxation  adopted  in  Hong  Kong  will  be  subject  to  the provisions  of  the  Ordinance  relating  to  the  allowance  of  a  deduction  and  a credit. Section 50 of the Ordinance provides for the allowance of a tax credit in  respect  of  arrangements  having  effect  under  section  49.    This  section

provides  the  basis  for  the  granting  of  a  tax  credit  in  relation  to  an  item  of income stipulated in the Comprehensive Arrangement and in respect of which tax  has  been  paid  in  the  Mainland.    Only  tax  paid  in  the  Mainland  can  be allowed as a credit under the Comprehensive Arrangement against Hong Kong tax.  In  accordance  with  section  50(2),  an  applicant  for  a  tax  credit  must  be resident in Hong Kong during the year of assessment in which the income is earned. However,  if  income  derived  by  a  Hong  Kong  resident  from  the Mainland does not arise in Hong Kong, it will not be chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.    The tax paid in the Mainland in respect of that item of income cannot be allowed as a credit because the question of double taxation does not arise. In the case of a Hong Kong manufacturer whose profits are apportioned on a 50:50 basis, only half of the profits will be taxed in Hong Kong.    The other half  is  regarded  as  having  been  derived  from  the  Mainland  and  is  thus  not chargeable  to  tax  in  Hong  Kong.    Under  such  circumstances,  where  tax  has been paid in the Mainland in respect of half or less than half of the profits, such tax  will  not  be  allowed  as  a  credit  against  the  Hong  Kong  tax  payable.    If more  than  one  half  of  the  profits  are  regarded  by  the  Mainland  as  profits derived therefrom according to the Comprehensive Arrangement, then the tax paid in the Mainland in respect of such profits, in excess of one half of the total profits, will be allowed as a credit against the tax payable in Hong Kong.

131. According to the abovementioned tax credit method, the tax credit in respect  of  tax  paid  in  the  Mainland  allowable  for  set  off  in  Hong  Kong  is computed  in  accordance  with  sections  50(3)  and  50(5)  of  the  Ordinance  as follows:

## Example 5

(Note 2) The formula of the credit limit is based on sections 50(3) and 50(5) of the Ordinance.    If the tax payable by a taxpayer is computed at flat rate, the following simplified formula can be used to compute the credit limit:

| Tax credit limit Taxable for tax paid in the = from the Mainland Mainland   |                                              | Tax payable in Hong Kong x Total assessable income   |

132. In  the  case  of  an  individual  taxpayer  whose  tax  is  computed  at progressive tax rates, the tax credit is computed as follows:

## Example 6

| Net income after tax from the Mainland              | 110,000 |

The effective tax rate in Hong Kong and the tax credit are computed as follows:

134. The computation of tax credit for royalties received by Hong Kong residents:

## Example 8

Hong Kong resident Company D prepares its accounts annually for the  year  ending  31  December.    For  the  year  ended  31  December 2007, Company D receives royalties of $90,000 from the Mainland and the tax withheld in the Mainland is $6,300 (i.e. $90,000 x 7%). Such  royalties  are  income  arising  in  Hong  Kong.    The  amount  of expenses  allowable  for  deduction  under  the  Ordinance  (excluding the tax withheld) is $70,000.    Company D does not have any other income or expenses during the relevant year.

(Note 1) In accordance with section 50(5), tax paid in the Mainland which is not  allowed  as  a  tax  credit,  i.e.  $3,394  ($6,300  -  $2,906),  can  be allowed as a deduction as shown in the detailed computation below:

(Note 2) The formula of the credit limit is based on sections 50(3) and 50(5) of the Ordinance.    As the tax payable by Company D is computed at flat rate, the following simplified formula can be used to compute the credit limit:

| Tax credit limit for tax paid in the   |    | Taxable income    | Tax payable in Hong Kong   |
|----------------------------------------|----|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Mainland                               | =  | from the Mainland | Total assessable income    |

| in the Mainland                                 | = $20,000 | x  | $20,000 |        |
|                                                 | = $3,500  |    |         |        |

## Example 9

Following  Example  8,  assume  Company  D,  in  addition  to  the royalties  from  the  Mainland,  receives  royalties  of  $80,000  from Thailand and the tax withheld in Thailand is $8,000 (i.e. $80,000 x 10%).    Company D incurs expenses of $20,000 (excluding the tax withheld  in  the  Thailand)  in  the  production  of  royalties  from Thailand and such expenses are allowable for deduction under the Ordinance.    Company D does not have other income or expenses during the relevant year.

Since the Comprehensive Arrangement applies to years of assessment beginning  on  or  after  1  April  2007  in  Hong  Kong,  the  tax  withheld  in  the Mainland in respect of the royalties received by Hong Kong resident Company

D from 1 January 2007 to 31 March 2007 will be allowed as a credit against its Hong Kong tax payable, see paragraph 9 above.

135. Section 50(4) of the Ordinance provides that the total tax credit to be allowed to a Hong Kong resident for a year of assessment in respect of foreign tax paid shall not exceed the total tax payable in Hong Kong for that year of assessment. Therefore,  if  a  Hong  Kong  resident  suffers  a  loss  in  a  year  of assessment  and  does  not  pay  any  Hong  Kong  tax  (i.e.  tax  credit  allowed  is zero), the tax paid by him in the Mainland will not be allowed as a credit.
136. Under  section  50(5),  the  amount  of  tax  paid  in  the  Mainland  is included  in  computing  profits  or  income  subject  to  tax  in  Hong  Kong. However, due to the differences in tax rates between the Mainland and Hong Kong, the tax paid in the Mainland may exceed the amount of the credit limit. In such circumstances, the excess is allowed as a deduction. Any tax paid in the  Mainland  that  is  not  allowed  as  a  credit  is  not  available  to  be  carried forward to subsequent years of assessment.
137. A claim for a tax credit is required, in accordance with section 50(9) of the Ordinance, to be made within 2 years after the end of the relevant year of assessment. The claim can be submitted with the tax return for the relevant year  of  assessment  or  made  separately  in  writing.    Any  dispute  over  the allowance of a tax credit is to be dealt with in accordance with the objection and appeal provisions of the Ordinance.
138. Under  the  provisions  of  section  50(10)  of  the  Ordinance,  a  Hong Kong  resident  who  considers  that  the  tax  credit  allowed  for  a  year  of assessment is excessive or insufficient because of a subsequent adjustment to the amount of tax payable by either Side can make a claim within 2 years from the time when the assessment, adjustment or other determination by either Side has been made. The period for lodging the claim will not be limited by the time for raising an assessment or for lodgement of any other claim under the Ordinance.    The  relevant  assessment,  adjustment  or  determination  must  be material in determining whether and to what extent a tax credit is allowable. It should be noted that those provisions do not apply to any new claim for a tax credit,  as  the  application  for  such  claim  should  be  made  in  accordance  with section 50(9).

139. Paragraph 3 of Article 21 provides that where dividends received by a resident company of One Side which controls not less than 10% of the shares of a resident company of the Other Side, the credit that the resident company of that  One  Side  is  entitled  to  will  include  the  tax  paid  by  the  company  which pays  the  dividends  in  respect  of  the  profits  from  which  such  dividends  are derived. As dividends are not chargeable to tax in Hong Kong, this provision will have no practical application to Hong Kong resident companies.
140. Before a tax credit is allowed, it will need to be established to the satisfaction of the Inland Revenue Department that the tax has been paid by the person in the Mainland. The person will need to submit the tax computation issued  by  the  tax  authority  of  the  Mainland  (showing  details  of  the  relevant income and tax paid thereon) together with documentary evidence to the effect that the tax has been paid and is not subject to any further adjustment.

## Article 22 NON-DISCRIMINATION

141. Paragraph 1 of Article 22 establishes the principle that, for purposes of  taxation,  discrimination  based  on  the  actual  situs  of  an  enterprise  is forbidden. This paragraph provides that the taxation on a  permanent establishment which an enterprise of One Side has in the Other Side shall not be  less  favourably  levied  in  that  Other  Side  than  the  taxation  levied  on enterprises of that Other Side carrying on the same activities.
142. Paragraph 2 of Article 22 aims at eliminating discrimination on the grounds  of  the  resident  status  of  the  persons  receiving  payments.    This paragraph provides that interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of One Side to a resident of the Other Side shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of that One Side, except under specified circumstances.
143. Paragraph 3 of Article 22 forbids One Side to give less favourable treatment  to  enterprises  of  that  Side  where  the  capital  of  the  enterprise  is wholly  or  partly  owned  or  controlled,  directly  or  indirectly,  by  one  or  more residents of the Other Side. This paragraph provides that enterprises of One Side shall not, by reason of their capital being owned or controlled by residents

of  the  Other  Side,  be  subjected  in  the  One  Side  to  any  taxation  or  any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the One Side are or may be subjected.

## Article 23 MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE

144. The  Comprehensive  Arrangement  is  a  bilateral  arrangement  made between  the  State  Administration  of  Taxation  and  the  Hong  Kong  Inland Revenue Department after consultation which allocates the right to tax between the two jurisdictions. It sets out mainly matters of principle. In the course of applying the Comprehensive Arrangement, it is possible that problems relating to the specific interpretation of the provisions and uncertainties may arise and need to be addressed. For this reason, Article 23 provides that the competent authorities of both Sides shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties  or  doubts  arising  as  to  the  interpretation  or  application  of  the Comprehensive Arrangement, and may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Comprehensive Arrangement. For  the  purposes  of  reaching  an  agreement,  representatives  of  the  competent authorities  of  both  Sides  may  meet  and  exchange  their  opinions  verbally. Consultation in respect of the Comprehensive Arrangement shall be dealt with centrally  between  the  State  Administration  of  Taxation  and  the  Hong  Kong Inland  Revenue  Department,  and  not  be  conducted  separately  between  the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department and different local taxation authorities of the Mainland.
145. Paragraph 1 of Article 23 states clearly that where a person considers that  the  actions  of  One  Side  or  both  Sides  result  or  will  result  for  him  in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Comprehensive Arrangement, he may present his case to the competent authority of the Side of which he is a resident. The case must be presented within 3 years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Comprehensive Arrangement.
146. The competent authority receiving the claim shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified, and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory  solution,  to  resolve  the  case  by  mutual  agreement  with  the

competent authority of the Other Side, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement.    Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the respective domestic laws of both Sides.

147. Hong  Kong  residents  presenting  to  the  Commissioner  of  Inland Revenue a case which satisfies the requirements set out in paragraph 145 above, should also provide all information relevant to the case (e.g. details of activities that give rise to taxation carried out in the Mainland or in Hong Kong, details of negotiations with the competent authority of the Mainland including copies of  documents,  letters,  notices  of  assessment  and  demand  notes),  so  that  the Inland  Revenue  Department  may  examine  the  case  and  consult  with  the competent authority of the Mainland.

## Article 24 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION

148. In line with international practice, the Comprehensive Arrangement contains provisions on the exchange of information.    Paragraph 1 of Article 24 states  that  the  competent  authorities  of  both  Sides  shall  exchange  such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of the Comprehensive Arrangement or of the domestic laws of both Sides concerning taxes covered by the Comprehensive Arrangement. Paragraph 1 also makes it clear  that  the  exchange  of  information  is  not  restricted  by  Article  1  (Persons Covered), i.e. information relating to persons who are not residents of One Side or both Sides may be exchanged, provided that the exchange of information is for purposes compatible with this Article.
149. In order to ensure that information relating to taxpayers will not be misused,  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement  provides  that  any  information received by One Side from the Other Side shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that Side. In other words,  both  the  Mainland  and  Hong  Kong  shall  keep  information  obtained from the other party confidential and such information shall be disclosed only to  persons  or  authorities  concerned  with  the  assessment  or  collection  of,  the enforcement  or  prosecution  in  respect  of,  or  the  determination  of  appeals  in relation  to,  the  taxes  covered  by  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement.    Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes.    They

may  disclose  the  information  in  public  court  proceedings  or  in  judicial decisions,  including,  in case  of  Hong  Kong,  the  decisions  of  the  Board  of Review.    Both  Sides  also  specify  in  the  Protocol  to  the  Comprehensive Arrangement that information may not be disclosed to any other jurisdiction without  the  consent  of  the  Side  which  furnished  the  information  in  the  first place.

150. Information received by the Mainland from the competent authority of Hong Kong will not be used by the Mainland to impose taxes which are not taxes covered by the Comprehensive Arrangement, such as custom duties and value-added taxes.
151. Paragraph  2  of  Article  24  specifies  that  in no  case  shall the provisions  of  paragraph  1  in  relation  to  the  exchange  of  information  be construed so as to impose on One Side the obligation to carry out administrative  measures  at  variance  with  the  laws  and  the  administrative practice of either Side; to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of either Side; or to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy.
152. The power conferred on the Inland Revenue Department by virtue of the  provisions  of  the  Ordinance  in  relation  to  the  seeking  of  information  is restricted to cases where any matter relating to any liability or obligation of any person under the Ordinance is at issue.
153. Currently the Department would, in general, not provide automatic exchange  of  information,  such  as  supply  of  bank  interest  information  on  a periodic basis. Nor would the Department spontaneously provide information which it supposes to be of interest to the Mainland. The Department will only supply information upon  specific requests received from  the  competent authority of the Mainland in justifiable cases, and only where such requests are in  compliance  with  the  conditions  as  laid  down  in  the  Comprehensive Arrangement. These general rules will also be adopted by the Mainland. It is understood that the means of seeking information available under the internal taxation procedures should be exhausted in the first place before any request for information would be made to the Other Side.

154. Article  24  provides  that  the  exchange  of  information  shall  be conducted  by  the  competent  authorities  of  both  Sides.    Paragraph  1(8)  of Article 3 of the  Comprehensive  Arrangement  provides  that  'competent authority'  means,  in  the  case  of  the  Mainland,  the  State  Administration  of Taxation or its authorized representatives; and in the case of Hong Kong, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his authorized representative.    Therefore, all  requests  for  exchange  of  information  should  be  put  forward  by  the  State Administration  of  Taxation  (unless  the  State  Administration  of  Taxation  has authorized  a  representative).    The  Hong  Kong  Inland  Revenue  Department will  not  exchange  information  with  unauthorized  local  tax  authorities  of  the Mainland.
155. Section 49(5) of the Ordinance stipulates that 'where any arrangements have effect by virtue of this section, the obligation as to secrecy imposed by section 4 shall not prevent the disclosure to any authorized officer of the government with which the arrangements are made of such information as is required to be disclosed under the arrangements'. In addition, according to  paragraph  (c)  of  section  58(1)  of  the  Personal  Data  (Privacy)  Ordinance (Chapter 486), disclosure of relevant information to the competent authority of the  Mainland  by  the  Commissioner  of  Inland  Revenue  or  his  authorized representative for the purposes of implementing the Comprehensive Arrangement  does  not  violate  the  information  protection  principles  of  the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance.
156. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has obtained legal advice on the  Exchange  of  Information  Article  of  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement. Provided that the Inland Revenue Department complies with the rules as laid down  in  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement  when  carrying  out  the  relevant provisions, there would  be  no  contravention of the Basic Law  or  the International  Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political  Rights. Hong Kong's existing legislation (including the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance) does not provide that the Inland Revenue Department should inform the taxpayer concerned if it has  passed  on  information  relating  to  him  to  the  competent  authority  of  the Mainland. Accordingly, the  Department  would  not  provide  taxpayers  with details of any such exchanges.
157. Information  exchange  is  carried  out  only  after  the  Comprehensive Arrangement  is  in  force. Where  information  that  existed  prior  to  the  entry

into force of the Comprehensive Arrangement is exchanged, such information should  not  be  used  in  the  assessment  or  collection  of,  the  enforcement  or prosecution  in  respect  of,  or  the  determination  of  appeals  in  relation  to,  the taxes for the following years:

- (1) In the Mainland: any taxable years before 1 January 2007;
- (2) In Hong Kong: any years of assessment before 1 April 2007.

## Article 25 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

158. Article 25 states clearly that nothing in the Comprehensive Arrangement shall prejudice the right of either Side to apply its domestic laws and measures to prevent tax avoidance. 'To prevent tax avoidance' shall be construed as including the prevention of the abusive use of the Comprehensive Arrangement. In the case of Hong Kong, the laws and measures concerning tax avoidance include sections 5B, 9(1A), 9A, 15(1)(j), 15(1)(k), 15(1)(l), 16(2), 16(2A), 16(2B), 16(2C), 16(2D), 16(2E), 16(2F), 16E(2A), 16E(2B), 18D(2A), 20, 20AE, 21A(1)(a), 22B, 38B, 39E, 61, 61A and 61B of the Ordinance.

## Article 26 ENTRY INTO FORCE

159. In  Hong  Kong,  the  provisions  of  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement shall apply to income derived in the years of assessment beginning on or after 1 April 2007; and in the Mainland, in the taxable years beginning on or after 1 January  2007. The  relevant  provisions  of  the  Air  Services  Arrangement (paragraph 6 of Article 11) signed between the Mainland and Hong Kong and the Limited Arrangement (see paragraph 1 above) shall cease to have effect on the  date  on  which  the  Comprehensive  Arrangement  applies  to  the  relevant types of tax. The provisions of the Comprehensive Arrangement shall apply in  the  Shenzhen  Bay  Port  Hong  Kong  Port  Area  from  its  commencement  of operation on 1 July 2007.

## Article 27 TERMINATION

160. The Comprehensive Arrangement shall remain in force indefinitely, but  One  Side  may  give  the  Other  Side  written  notice  of  termination  on  or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of a period of 5 years from  the  date  of its entry into force. In such  event,  the Comprehensive Arrangement shall cease to have effect from:
- (1) in  the  Mainland:  the  taxable  year  beginning  on  or  after  1 January in the calendar year next following the year in which the notice is given;
- (2) in Hong Kong: the year of assessment beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following the year in which the notice is given.

## CONCLUSION

161. The Comprehensive Arrangement is intended to effectively resolve problems  of  double  taxation  faced  by  residents  of  the  Mainland  and  Hong Kong and to promote commercial and trading activities between the two Sides. The  explanations  concerning  Mainland  taxation  treatment  mentioned  in  this Note (in the Chinese version) have been vetted by the International Taxation Department of the State Administration of Taxation. This would contribute to the effective implementation of the Comprehensive Arrangement.
