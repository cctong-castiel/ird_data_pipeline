## INTRODUCTION

Hong  Kong  has entered into a number of Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) with other tax jurisdictions. One of the main purposes of such  agreements  is  the  avoidance  of  double  taxation.    This  Departmental Interpretation and Practice Note sets out the Department's views and practices on  granting  relief  from  double  taxation  due  to  a  transfer  pricing  or  profit reallocation adjustment under a DTA.

## Types of international double taxation

2. Generally, two types of international double taxation are recognised in the context of DTAs:
2. (a) economic double taxation; and
3. (b) juridical double taxation.
3. Economic  double  taxation  arises  where  two  enterprises  resident  in different states are assessed to tax on the same profit or income, without relief provided by either state  for  tax  imposed  by  the  other.    This  double  taxation may arise as a consequence of non-arm's length transactions. The profits of one  enterprise  are  adjusted  upwards  increasing  the  tax  charged  on  that enterprise  in  one  state  (i.e.  a  primary  transfer  pricing  adjustment),  without  a corresponding  downward  adjustment  to  the  tax  payable  of  the  associated enterprise in the other state.
4. Juridical double taxation occurs where an enterprise is charged to tax on the same profit or income in two different states (e.g. a single legal entity having  a  head  office  in  its  state  of  residence  has  set  up  a  permanent establishment  in  another  state),  without  either  state  providing  relief  for  tax imposed by the other. This double taxation may arise where the profits that are taken to have arisen from the enterprise's operations in a state are adjusted upwards  to  increase  the  tax  payable  in  that  state  (i.e.  a  primary  profit reallocation adjustment) without a corresponding downward adjustment to the enterprise's profits from its operations in the other state.
5. In  each  of  the  DTAs  of  the  Hong  Kong  SAR,  the  Associated Enterprises  Article,  which  is  modeled  on  Article  9  of  the  OECD  Model  Tax Convention  on  Income  and  on  Capital  (the  OECD  Model),  provides  for primary  transfer  pricing  adjustments  by  a  DTA  state.    The  Associated Enterprises  Article  also  provides  a  mechanism  for  relief  from  the  resultant economic double taxation to be given by the other DTA state.
6. The  Business  Profits  Article  and  the  Methods  for  Elimination  of Double  Taxation  Article,  which  are  modeled  on  Article  7  and  Article  23 respectively of the OECD Model, in each of the DTAs of the Hong Kong SAR provide  for  both  primary  profit  reallocation  adjustments  and  relief  from  the resultant juridical double taxation.
7. Each  of  the  DTAs  of  the  Hong  Kong  SAR  contains  a  Mutual Agreement Procedure Article, which is  modeled on Article 25 of the OECD Model, that provides, inter alia, for the resolution of cases where a taxpayer is faced  with  international  double  taxation. In  that  article,  double  taxation  is usually regarded as 'taxation not in accordance' with the DTA.    The Mutual Agreement Procedure Article enables the competent authorities, which in the case  of  the  Hong  Kong  SAR  is  the  Commissioner  of  Inland  Revenue  (the Commissioner),  to  consult  with  each  other  with  a  view  to  resolving  double taxation though it does not compel agreement. Paragraph 37 of the Commentary  on  Article  25  of  the  OECD  Model,  which  is  relevant  to interpreting the Mutual Agreement Procedure Article, states:
9. 'Paragraph 2 (of Article 25) no doubt entails a duty to negotiate; but as  far  as  reaching  mutual  agreement  through  the  procedure  is concerned, the competent authorities are under a duty merely to use their best endeavours and not to achieve a result ...'

## Where no double tax agreement exists

8. Where either the Commissioner or the tax administration of another state makes a transfer pricing or profit reallocation adjustment and no relevant DTA exists, no bilateral procedures are in place. Accordingly, the question of any relief from the resultant double taxation does not arise.

## Transfer pricing adjustment by a non-DTA state

9. Where  economic  double  taxation  arises  from  a  transfer  pricing adjustment made by the tax administration of a non-DTA state to increase the taxable income of an associated enterprise, there are no provisions under the Inland Revenue Ordinance (the IRO) permitting:
2. (a) the profit  which  has  been  derived  by  the  Hong  Kong enterprise 1 to be treated as not derived; or
3. (b) a deduction to be allowed to the Hong Kong enterprise where no expenditure has been incurred.
10. In  these  circumstances,  the  foreign  tax  paid  is  a  liability  of  the associated  enterprise  in  the  other  state. The  adjustment  does  not  affect  the profits of the Hong Kong enterprise, and therefore no adjustment can be made to the profits of the Hong Kong enterprise.
11. Where juridical  double  taxation  arises  for  a  Hong  Kong  enterprise that is subject to a profit reallocation adjustment made by a non-DTA state, the profit  which  has  been  subject  to  double  taxation  will  not  be  excluded  from taxation in Hong Kong because the profit has been properly assessed to profits tax as Hong Kong sourced profits. Neither can relief by way of a tax credit be provided under section 50 of the IRO in the absence of a DTA.
12. The permanent establishment of a non-resident enterprise is subject to profits tax in Hong Kong on profits sourced in Hong Kong and expenses are not deductible if they are attributable to profits that are sourced outside Hong Kong. Any relief from double taxation can only be provided by the non-DTA state.
13. Where the Assessor finds a Hong Kong enterprise or the permanent establishment  of  a  non-resident  enterprise  has  been  assessed  at  less  than  the proper amount because transfer prices are not structured at arm's length, he can raise  an  additional  assessment  under  section  60  of  the  IRO. The  basis  on

In  a  DTA  entered  into  by  the  Hong Kong  SAR,  a  'Hong  Kong  enterprise'  typically  means  an enterprise  carried  on  by  a  resident of Hong  Kong.    The  term  'Hong Kong resident'  is  also categorically defined in the relevant DTA, depending on whether it is an individual, a corporation or other legally constituted person. 1

which  transfer  pricing  adjustments  are  to  be  made  is  explained  in  another Departmental Interpretation and Practice Note.

## ECONOMIC DOUBLE TAXATION

## Transfer pricing adjustment by a DTA state

14. Where the Commissioner agrees with a DTA state that the transfer pricing adjustment by it is correct both in principle and amount, the relevant assessment of the Hong Kong enterprise will be revised in accordance with the relief provision in the Associated Enterprises Article of the DTA and section 79 of  the  IRO  to  refund  the  excess  tax  paid  or  to  reduce  the  tax  that  would otherwise be payable on the assessable profits of the Hong Kong enterprise.
15. Regarding a transfer  pricing  adjustment  to  an  associated  enterprise made by the tax administration of a DTA state, the claim for an 'appropriate adjustment  to  the  amount  of  tax  charged'  must  be  made  by  the  Hong  Kong enterprise under section 79 of the IRO within 6 years of the end of the relevant year of assessment.
16. The Commissioner is only obligated to provide relief from economic double taxation if the primary transfer pricing adjustment is made  in accordance with the relevant DTA (i.e. by the application of the arm's length principle). Paragraph 6 of the Commentary on Article 9 of the OECD Model makes it clear that this is  the  result  intended. Paragraph 4.35 of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations states:

'Corresponding  adjustments  are  not  mandatory,  mirroring  the  rule that  tax  administrations  are  not  required  to  reach  agreement  under the mutual agreement procedure. Under paragraph 2 of Article 9, a tax  administration  should  make  a  corresponding  adjustment  only insofar as it considers the primary adjustment to be justified both in principle and in amount.'

## Example 1

Company  F  is  resident  in  Country  F,  a  DTA  state,  and  provided goods for no consideration to its wholly owned subsidiary, Company HK,  a  company  resident  in  Hong  Kong.    Country  F  subjected Company F to tax audit and increased the profits of Company F by $100,000  on  the  basis  that  if  Company  F  and  Company  HK  had transacted with each other on an arm's length basis, Company HK would have paid Company F $100,000 for the goods.

The resultant economic double taxation may be relieved by:

- (a) the  Commissioner  agreeing  that  $100,000  reflects  an  arm's length  price  and  reduces  the  tax  payable  by  Company  HK accordingly (i.e. reduce $16,500 of tax if the profits tax rate is 16.5 per cent); or
- (b) the tax administration of Country F being convinced that its adjustment is incorrect and accordingly reduces the additional tax  payable  by  Company  F  (e.g.  through  domestic  review, objection or appeal processes in Country F); or
- (c) the reaching of agreement between both competent authorities under the Mutual Agreement Procedure Article of the relevant DTA.
17. Relief for economic double taxation arising from a transfer pricing adjustment can only be provided under the combined effect of the DTA and section 79 of the IRO. Section 50 of the IRO deals with profits derived by Hong Kong enterprises and addresses juridical double taxation by providing tax credits for tax imposed by the other DTA state (see paragraphs 36 to 51 below).
18. The  following  examples  illustrate  how  appropriate  adjustments  are made:

## Example 2

Company  HK  resident in Hong  Kong  purchased goods from Company F resident  in  a  DTA  state  and  paid  $200,000  for  goods that had an arm's length price of $300,000. After the tax administration in Country F had made an upward transfer pricing adjustment,  Company  F  paid  an  extra  $50,000  income  tax  in Country F where the tax rate was 50 per cent.

Company HK's assessable profits would have been $100,000 less if it  had  paid  the  arm's  length  price.    The  appropriate  adjustment would be a $16,500 reduction in the profits tax payable of Company HK if the profits tax rate is 16.5 per cent.

## Example 3

Company HK resident in Hong Kong supplied goods to Company F resident in Country  F, a DTA  state, for  $400,000. The  tax administration of Country F determined that the arm's length price should  be  $200,000.    The  taxable  profits  of  Company  F  were increased  by  $200,000  because  Company  F  would  not  have  been entitled to deduct this amount if it had transacted on an arm's length basis with Company HK. Company F paid an extra $100,000 tax in Country F where the tax rate was 50 per cent.

The assessable profits of Company HK would have been $200,000 less  if  it  had  supplied  the  goods  for  arm's  length  price.    The appropriate adjustment would be a $33,000 reduction in the profits tax  payable  of  Company  HK  if  the  Hong  Kong  profits  tax  rate  is 16.5 per cent.

## Example 4

Company F resident in the Mainland, a DTA jurisdiction, provided a licence over a patent to Company HK resident in Hong Kong at an annual royalty rate of $50,000. The patent has not been owned at any time by any person carrying on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong (i.e. section 21A(a) of the IRO does not apply). The

Mainland tax authorities made a primary transfer pricing adjustment  to  increase  the  royalty  by  $100,000  because  the  arm' s length amount would equal $150,000.    The Commissioner agrees to such  an  upward  adjustment  as  being  correct  in  principle  and amount.

The Commissioner would make an appropriate downward adjustment of $100,000 under Article 9(2) to reduce Company HK's profits, and increase the royalty  received  by  Company  F  by $100,000. Under Article 12 of the DTA with the Mainland and the IRO, any royalty arising from Hong Kong is subject to a withholding tax rate of 7 or 4.95 per cent (i.e. 16.5 per cent of 30 per cent under section 21A of the IRO, assuming the profits tax rate to be 16.5 per cent),  whichever  is  the  lower. The lower rate  of  4.95  per  cent  is therefore applicable to the royalty received by Company  F. Company  F's  liability  to  withholding  tax  under  section  20B  and Article 12 would have been $7,425 (i.e. 4.95 per cent of $150,000) if the transaction  had  been  structured  on  an  arm's  length  basis. Company F's  additional  tax  liability  would  be  $4,950  (i.e.  $7,425 less $2,475 paid earlier on $50,000). Company HK is required to deduct  and  forward  that  additional  amount  to  the  Commissioner under section 20B.

19. If  a  DTA  does  not  contain  a  provision  specifically  directed  at  the relief  of  economic  double  taxation,  the  Commissioner  does  not  consider  that there is an obligation to provide relief from economic double taxation.

## Appropriate adjustment of tax charged

20. The DTAs of the Hong Kong SAR are to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion. The language of the DTAs permits a relief from actual double taxation in respect of 'tax charged' or 'tax paid' in a DTA state.
21. The  Associated  Enterprises Article requires that tax has  been charged  on  the  same  profits  by  the  two  DTA  states  before  an  appropriate adjustment  can  be  considered. The  expressions  'taxes  accordingly'  and 'charged to tax' used in the context of the article clearly envisage liabilities to tax to be actually in existence or arising in both tax jurisdictions in respect of the adjusted profit.

22. This  means  actual  double  taxation  does  not  arise  while  one  of  the associated enterprises is, or both are, in a loss position. Double taxation will arise at a later stage when the enterprise concerned returns to profit and relief may be provided at that time. The provision of relief will depend on the facts of each case.

## Example 5

Company F is resident in Country F, a DTA state, and it transferred goods  for  no  consideration  to  Company  HK,  a  wholly  owned subsidiary company resident in Hong Kong. Country F subjected Company F to tax audit and increased its profits by $100,000 on the basis that if Company F and Company HK had transacted with each other  on  an  arm's  length  basis,  Company  HK  would  have  paid $100,000 for the goods. Company F had a loss of $300,000 prior to the transfer pricing adjustment. Company F returned a profit of $300,000  for  the  next  year,  offset  by  loss  of  $200,000  brought forward and paid income tax on $100,000.

The  transfer  pricing  adjustment  resulted  in  a  reduction  of  the  loss carried  forward  by  Company  F  from  $300,000  to  $200,000.    No relief could be made to Company HK in the first year. A relief of $16,500  could  be  provided  to  Company  HK  in  the  second  year, being tax on $100,000 if the tax rate is 16.5 per cent, by making an appropriate adjustment.    Equally, if the Hong Kong enterprise had been  in  a  loss  position,  an  appropriate  adjustment  could  not  have been  made  until  it  returns  to  a  profit  position  in  a  later  year. In such a case, the claim under section 79 for an appropriate adjustment should be made within 6 years of the end of the year of assessment in which it returns to a profit position.

## Retrospective adjustment

23. Hong Kong enterprises should not seek to relieve economic double taxation  by  claiming  deductions  under  section  16  for  subsequent  payments purporting  to  represent  a  retrospective  adjustment  to  transactions  previously undertaken with an associated enterprise in another state.

24. The  payments  did  not  represent  outgoings  and  expenses  incurred under section 16 in the production of profits chargeable to profits tax and are therefore not tax deductible. Nor can the retrospective adjustment be accepted as error or omission in terms of section 70A.
25. Relief  from  or  resolution  of  economic  double  taxation  must  be sought by presentation of the case to the Commissioner under section 79 and/or under the Mutual Agreement Procedure Article of the relevant DTA.

## Deemed dividend

26. The Commissioner will not accept a sum as a non-taxable dividend even if the tax administration of a DTA state treats the profits shifted to a Hong Kong enterprise to be a 'deemed dividend'. These circumstances arise where that  tax  administration  considers  that  profits  have  been  transferred  to  an associated enterprise resident in Hong Kong and deems for its tax purposes the increased consideration to be a 'dividend' paid by the foreign enterprise to the Hong Kong enterprise.
27. The  exemption  under  section  26(a)  of  the  IRO  only  applies  to dividends for the purposes of the domestic law.    This means that an exemption cannot be claimed for profits received by a Hong Kong enterprise which is a 'deemed dividend' under the law of another state but not under the laws of the Hong Kong SAR.
28. The nature of the sum accrued to the Hong Kong enterprise would remain unchanged. A trading receipt will continue to be assessed as a trading receipt under the IRO though it is deemed by the tax administration of a DTA state as dividend paid to the Hong Kong enterprise.

## Transfer pricing adjustment by the Commissioner

29. If  the  Commissioner  makes  a  transfer  pricing  upward  adjustment under the Associated Enterprises Article and/or the provisions of the IRO, it is up  to  the  associated  enterprise  of  the  DTA  state  to  seek  relief  from  the  tax administration  of  that  state  in  respect  of  the  adjustment  made  on  the  Hong Kong enterprise. The Commissioner will be ready to demonstrate on request to  the  competent  authority  of  the  DTA  state  that  the  adjustment  made  is  in accordance with the DTA.

30. The  mechanism  to  be  used  in  a  DTA  state  to  relieve  economic double taxation is a matter for the tax administration of that state.

## Losses

31. The Commissioner's view on relief from economic double taxation where one of the associated enterprises is, or both are, in a loss position is set out  in  paragraphs  20  to  22  above. A  DTA  state  may  arrive  at  a  different interpretation of a relevant DTA or may have provisions in their domestic laws that  enable  a  different  approach  to  be  taken  (e.g.  restoring  income  and deductions to what they would have been had the transactions been undertaken on an arm's length basis in the first place).

## Exchange of information

32. To enable a DTA state to give effect to its relevant DTA obligations and  general  domestic  law  provisions,  the  Commissioner  will,  on  request, exchange information about any transfer pricing adjustment with the competent authority of a DTA state. This exchange will be made under the Exchange of Information Article of the relevant DTA.

## Withholding taxes

33. The  basis  upon  which  the  tax  administration  of  a  DTA  state  will calculate the appropriate amount of tax relief from withholding taxes and the mechanisms  for  the  provision  of  relief  from  economic  double  taxation  in equivalent circumstances are matters for determination by that administration.
34. Where withholding taxes have been paid (e.g. where royalty is paid to a Hong Kong enterprise giving rise to a liability and payment of withholding tax  by  the  Hong  Kong  enterprise  in  the  source  state),  a  tax  credit  would  be available  under  section  50  for  the  foreign  withholding  tax  paid  if  the  same profit is subject to profits tax in the Hong Kong SAR.
35. If the Commissioner makes an adjustment pursuant to the IRO and/ or the relevant DTA to increase the quantum of the royalty or income deemed to have been received by the Hong Kong enterprise, the basis upon which the tax administration of a DTA state will compute the appropriate amount of tax

relief  and  the  mechanisms  for  the  provision  of  relief  from  economic  double taxation are matters for determination by that tax administration and subject to the provisions of the relevant DTA.

## JURIDICAL DOUBLE TAXATION

## Profit reallocation by a DTA state

36. Profits  of  a  Hong  Kong  enterprise  properly  assessed  under  section 14  as  profits  arising  in  or  derived  from  Hong  Kong  might  be  regarded  by another  DTA  state  as  profits  sourced  within  its  jurisdiction  under  the  DTA. Juridical double taxation suffered by a Hong Kong enterprise arising from the application of the domestic tax law of the source DTA state can be relieved by way of a tax credit under section 50 of the IRO for the foreign tax paid. Any claim for allowance by way of tax credit must be made not later than 2 years after the end of the relevant year of assessment.
37. The DTAs of the Hong Kong SAR permit the DTA state in which a Hong Kong enterprise carries on business through a permanent establishment to tax the profits 'attributable to the permanent establishment'.    These profits are often deemed to be profits from sources in that state under foreign domestic law.
38. Where a DTA state exercises the right to tax the profits of the Hong Kong enterprise in accordance with the Business Profits Article, the Commissioner will provide relief from the resultant double taxation if the same profits  have  been  subject  to  profits  tax  in  the  Hong  Kong  SAR.    The obligation  to  provide  relief  is  contained  in  the  Methods  for  Elimination  of Double Taxation Article.
39. The Business Profits Article also requires a DTA state to apply the same principle in attributing  profits  to  a  permanent  establishment  (i.e.  'there shall  in  each  Contracting  State  be  attributed  to  that  permanent  establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise ...').    The mutual application of this principle ensures:

- (a) the  appropriate  exercise  of  the  source  state's  taxing  rights; and
- (b) the provision of appropriate relief by the residence state.
40. The Mutual Agreement Procedure Article in the DTAs of the Hong Kong  SAR  can  be  used  to  facilitate  agreement  where  DTA  states  differ  on profit allocations under the Business Profits Article (i.e. where a Hong Kong enterprise  considers  that  it  has  been  taxed  not  in  accordance  with  a  relevant DTA),  though  the  Mutual  Agreement  Procedure  Article  does  not  compel agreement.

## Adjustment by foreign tax administration

41. The tax administration of a DTA state may make a profit reallocation adjustment to:
2. (a) a  Hong  Kong  enterprise  carrying  on  business  through  a permanent establishment in the DTA state; or
3. (b) an enterprise resident in the DTA state carrying on business through a permanent establishment in Hong Kong.
42. The DTA state may in relation to a Hong Kong enterprise:
5. (a) make a profit reallocation adjustment upon a factual finding that a permanent establishment of the enterprise existed or did not exist in that state, where the enterprise previously maintained a different opinion; or
6. (b) adjust the amount of profits considered to be attributable to a permanent establishment of the enterprise in that state.

The Commissioner will provide relief from juridical double taxation only to the extent that the Commissioner agrees both in principle and in amount with the profit reallocation adjustment made by the DTA state.

## Example 6

Company  HK  is  a  Hong  Kong  enterprise  subject  to  profits  tax  in Hong  Kong. It  carries  on  business  in  Country  F,  a  DTA  state, through  a  permanent  establishment.    Company  HK  lodged  tax returns in both Hong Kong and Country F, returning a profit for tax purposes  of  $10  million  in  Hong  Kong,  of  which  $3  million  was attributable  to  the  permanent  establishment  in  Country  F  and  $7 million was profit sourced in Hong Kong under Hong Kong tax laws. The  tax  administration  of  Country  F  subsequently  audited  the  tax return of the permanent establishment, and determined that non-arm's length transactions between the Hong Kong head office and the permanent establishment had resulted in an understatement of  the  profits  attributable  to  the permanent establishment.  Country F's  tax  administration  concluded  that  the  profits  of  the  permanent establishment should have been $4 million and deemed those profits to  have  been  derived  in  Country  F.    Country  F  accordingly reallocated an additional $1 million of Company HK's profits to the permanent establishment, making a total of $4 million attributable to it and imposed additional tax on Company HK.

The resultant juridical double taxation may be relieved by:

- (a) the  Commissioner agreeing that the profit attributable to the permanent  establishment  in  Country  F  should  have  been  $4 million  and  allowing  a  tax  credit  for  the  additional  foreign taxes paid; or
- (b) the  tax  administration  of  Country  F  being  convinced that its adjustment is incorrect and accordingly reduces the additional tax payable (e.g. through domestic review, objection or appeal processes in Country F); or
- (c) the reaching of agreement between both competent authorities (e.g.  under  the  Mutual  Agreement  Procedure  Article  of  the relevant DTA).

43. The  provisions  that  give  effect  to  the  obligation  to  provide  relief from  juridical  double  taxation  under  the  Methods  for  Elimination  of  Double Taxation Article in DTAs are contained in section 50 of the IRO.
44. Under section 50, an entitlement to a tax credit for foreign tax arises where:
3. (a) the  assessable  profits  of  a  Hong  Kong  enterprise  includes profits subject to income taxation in a DTA state; and
4. (b) the Hong Kong enterprise has foreign tax paid or payable in respect of the same profits, being tax for which it was liable.
45. Where a DTA state has imposed tax in contravention of the DTA, the  Commissioner is not under any obligation to provide a tax credit for the additional foreign tax paid under section 50.
46. Juridical double taxation may occur where a non-resident enterprise that carries on a business through a permanent establishment in Hong Kong is subject to an adjustment by a foreign tax administration.

## Example 7

Company F is resident in Country F, a DTA state, and lodged tax returns in both Hong Kong and Country F and declared profits for tax purposes of $10 million of which $2 million was attributable to the permanent establishment in Hong Kong.    The tax administration of  Country  F  subjected  Company  F  to  audit  and  determined  that non-arm's length dealings between the head office in Country F and the  permanent  establishment  in  Hong  Kong  had  resulted  in  an overstatement of the profits attributable to the permanent establishment. The profits of the permanent establishment in Hong Kong were accordingly reduced to $1 million. Assuming Country F has a tax credit system it would then disallow credits for Hong Kong profits  tax  paid  on  $1  million,  or  if  it  had  an  exemption  system, Country F would reduce the amount of Company F's exempt income to $1 million.

The resultant juridical double taxation may be relieved by:

- (a) the Commissioner agreeing that the profits of the permanent establishment should have been $1 million and reducing the tax payable of the permanent establishment by $165,000 if the profits tax rate is 16.5 per cent; or
- (b) the  tax  administration  of  Country F being convinced that its adjustment is incorrect and accordingly reduces the additional tax  payable  by  Company  F  (e.g.  through  domestic  review, objection or appeal processes in Country F); or
- (c) an agreement is reached between both competent authorities (e.g. under  the  Mutual  Agreement  Procedure  Article  of  the relevant DTA).
47. An adjustment will be made to relieve juridical double taxation only if the Commissioner regards the reallocated profits as properly not attributable to the permanent establishment in Hong Kong. A refund will be made to the non-resident  enterprise  by  revising  the  relevant  assessment  made  under  the Business Profits Article and section 79. A claim under section 79 of the IRO must be made within 6 years of the end of the relevant year of assessment.

## Adjustment by the Commissioner

48. The  Commissioner  may  make  a  profit  reallocation adjustment pursuant to the IRO and/or the relevant DTA to either:
2. (a) a Hong Kong enterprise with a permanent establishment in a DTA state; or
3. (b) a  non-resident  enterprise  with  a  permanent  establishment  in Hong Kong.
49. Where the profit reallocation adjustment is made by the Commissioner, the Commissioner will on request demonstrate to the competent authority of the DTA state that the adjustment is in accordance with the DTA

so that relief from any resultant double taxation will be provided by the DTA state.

50. Juridical double taxation may arise where the Commissioner reduces the amount of profits of a Hong Kong enterprise attributable to its carrying on of business through a permanent establishment in the DTA state.

## Example 8

Company  HK  is  resident  in  Hong  Kong  and  carries  on  business through  a  permanent  establishment  in  Country  F,  a  DTA  state. Company HK lodged tax returns in both Hong Kong and Country F, declaring profits for Hong Kong profits tax purposes of $10 million, of  which  $3  million  was  considered  attributable  to  the  permanent establishment  in  Country  F. Country  F  assessed  to  income  tax Company HK on the $3 million. The Commissioner audited the tax return of Company HK and determined that the profits attributable to the permanent establishment were overstated because of non-arm's length transactions between the Hong Kong head office and  the  permanent  establishment.    The  Commissioner  concluded that the profits attributable to the permanent establishment should be $2  million  instead  of  $3  million. The  Commissioner  accordingly made  a  profit  reallocation  adjustment  reducing  Company  HK's offshore profits derived from Country F from $3 million to $2 million. This resulted in an additional assessment with an assessable profit of $1 million.

The resultant juridical double taxation may be relieved by:

- (a) the tax administration of Country F agreeing with the Commissioner's reallocation and reducing its taxes accordingly; or
- (b) domestic objection or appeal processes in Hong Kong finding the Commissioner's adjustment to be incorrect; or

- (c) the reaching of an agreement between both competent authorities (e.g. under  the  Mutual  Agreement  Procedure Article of the relevant DTA).
51. Juridical double taxation may arise where the Commissioner increases the amount of profits considered as being attributable to the business carried on by a non-resident enterprise through a permanent establishment in Hong Kong.

## Example 9

Company F is a company resident in Country F which is a DTA state. It  carries  on  business  through  a  permanent  establishment  in  Hong Kong. Company  F  declared  profits  of  $12  million,  of  which  $2 million  were  considered  as  being  attributable  to  the  permanent establishment  in  Hong  Kong. Company F returned an assessable profit of $2 million for Hong Kong profits tax purposes. The laws of  Country  F  might  either  provide  for  an  exemption  of  the  profits attributable to the permanent establishment in Hong Kong or tax the worldwide  profits  of  Company  F  with  a  credit  given  for  the  Hong Kong profits tax paid. The Commissioner audited the tax return of Company  F  and  determined  that  the  profits  attributable  to  the permanent establishment in Hong Kong were understated because of non-arm's length transactions between the head office and the Hong Kong  permanent  establishment.  The  Commissioner  concluded  that the profits attributable to the permanent establishment in Hong Kong should  be  $5  million  instead  of  $2  million.    The  Commissioner accordingly made  a profit reallocation adjustment, increasing Company F's Hong Kong assessable profits from $2 million to $5 million. This resulted in an additional assessment with an assessable profit of $3 million.

The resultant juridical double taxation may be relieved by:

- (a) the tax administration of Country F agreeing with the Commissioner's reallocation and reducing its taxes accordingly (e.g. by way of a credit for Hong Kong profits tax paid or an exemption for profits attributable to the permanent establishment in Hong Kong); or

- (b) domestic objection or appeal processes in Hong Kong finding the Commissioner's adjustment to be incorrect; or
- (c) the reaching of an agreement between both competent authorities (e.g. under  the  Mutual  Agreement  Procedure Article of the relevant DTA).

## TAXATION NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DTA

## The Mutual Agreement Procedure

52. The Mutual Agreement Procedure Article in the DTAs of the Hong Kong SAR enables a taxpayer to initiate the procedure where it is considered that  the  actions  of  the  competent  authority  of  one  or  both  of  the  states concerned result or will result in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of a DTA.
53. Taxation  not  in  accordance  with  a  DTA  can  arise  in  various situations, including transfer pricing and profit reallocation adjustments. This Departmental Interpretation and Practice Note only addresses the operation of the Mutual Agreement Procedure Article in the context of transfer pricing or profit reallocation adjustments.
54. There are two stages to the Mutual Agreement Procedure.    The first stage involves the taxpayer and the competent authority of its residence state. The second stage involves the endeavours of the competent authorities of both states to resolve the case.
55. The first stage has three elements:
5. (a) the  presentation  of  a  case  by  the  taxpayer  to  the  competent authority of its residence state;
6. (b) consideration  by  the  competent  authority  whether  the  case presented is justified; and

- (c) consideration by the competent authority whether it is able to arrive at a satisfactory solution itself.
56. If  the  case  cannot  be  resolved  at  the  first  stage,  the  competent authority  has  an  obligation  to  endeavour  to  resolve  the  case  by  mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other DTA state.

## Stage 1 -Presentation of case

57. The Mutual Agreement Procedure Article of the DTAs of the Hong Kong  SAR  provides  for  the  taxpayer  to  present  its  case  to  the  competent authority of the DTA state of which it is a resident. The address of the Hong Kong SAR competent authority for presenting a case is:
58. When presenting  a  case  to  the  Commissioner,  the  taxpayer  should include the following information:
3. (a) the basis upon which the opinion is formed that the actions of the  Commissioner and/or the DTA state result or will result for  that  taxpayer  in  taxation  not  in  accordance  with  the relevant DTA;
4. (b) full  details  of  the  relevant  transactions and the parties to the transactions as well as the actions relied upon; including the identification  of  the  DTA  state  involved,  how  the  actions affect  the  tax  liability  of  the  taxpayer  and  the  associated foreign enterprise where  relevant,  and  particulars of the taxation that does not accord with the relevant DTA; and
5. (c) how the taxpayer would like the problem resolved, including provisions of the domestic tax law and the DTA applicable to the resolution of the case.

59. Where  a  non-resident  taxpayer  presents  a  case  to  the  competent authority  of  its  resident  DTA  state  in  anticipation  of  the  Hong  Kong  SAR providing relief from double taxation, a copy of the case presented should be provided at the same time to the Commissioner. The provision of a copy at this time may:
2. (a) assist  in  the  resolution  of  the  case  in  the  quickest  possible time by enabling the Commissioner to undertake a preliminary review of the case;
3. (b) ensure that the Commissioner and the competent authority of the  other  DTA  state  are  satisfied  that  the  case  has  been presented within the time limits specified in the relevant DTA; and
4. (c) ensure that the requirements for presentation of a case to the competent authority have been satisfied.
60. The Mutual Agreement Procedure Article in the DTAs of the Hong Kong  SAR  permits  a  taxpayer  to  present  a  case  to  the  relevant  competent authority  within  three  years  from  the  first  notification  to  the  taxpayer  of  the actions giving rise to taxation not in accordance with the DTA.
61. For the purpose of applying this time limit, the first notification of actions giving rise to taxation not in accordance with the DTA is usually the relevant notice of assessment or loss computation issued by the Commissioner or  the  equivalent  notification  from  a  DTA  state.    This  view  accords  with paragraph 21 of the Commentary on the Mutual Agreement Procedure Article of  the  OECD  Model,  which  considers  that  the  first  notification  should  be interpreted in the way most favourable to the taxpayer.
62. The  competent  authority  on  being  presented  with  a  case  by  a taxpayer, must consider whether the case is justified (e.g. whether the taxpayer has reasonable grounds upon which to seek competent authority consideration). The action complained of must be directed specifically at the taxpayer.

63. The  Commissioner  could  be  expected  to  consider  a  case  as  being justified where the taxpayer has received notification in writing (e.g. a position paper or a notice of assessment or equivalent notice) from  either the Commissioner or the tax administration of a DTA state of a proposed transfer pricing or profit reallocation adjustment. This notification would need to reflect that  an  examination  or  audit  of  the  taxpayer's  affairs  was  significantly advanced in this regard (i.e. not just a mere possibility), and include details of adjustments, the amount involved and the basis of calculation.
64. Actions that the Commissioner is unlikely to consider sufficient to justify a case include:
3. (a) the mere existence of an audit or an examination of the affairs of the taxpayer or associated non-resident enterprise; or
4. (b) requests  from  the  Commissioner  or  a  DTA  state  for  an exchange of information about the dealings between the Hong Kong enterprise and an associated non-resident enterprise; or
5. (c) discussions between the taxpayer and a DTA state about the amount  and  source  of  profits  considered  attributable  to  the permanent  establishment  under  the  Business  Profits  Article; or
6. (d) discussions between an associated non-resident enterprise and a  DTA  state  concerning  non-arm's  length  dealings  between the taxpayer and the associated non-resident enterprise; or
7. (e) an interpretation of the tax laws by the Commissioner or of a DTA  state  ruling  or  of  policy  of  a  general  nature  that  the taxpayer believes could be applied to it and, if so, may result in taxation not in accordance with the DTA.
65. The issues raised by a ruling or policy of a DTA state will usually be of  general  application  and  will  not  be  related  to  any  particular  taxpayer.    A taxpayer should not base on any such ruling or policy to initiate the procedure. However, such ruling or policy may be useful to resolving any difficulties or doubts  about  the  interpretation  or  application  of  the  DTA  with  the  other

competent authority under the appropriate provision of the Mutual Agreement Procedure  Article. Therefore  taxpayers  may  bring  to  the  attention  of  the Commissioner such ruling or policy.

## Stage 2 - Joint resolution

66. The second stage commences with the competent authority that has been  presented  with  the  case  approaching  the  other  competent  authority. Paragraph 37 of the Commentary on Article 25 of the OECD Model recognises that this stage imposes on the competent authorities a duty to negotiate and to use their best endeavours to resolve a case.

67. Where the primary transfer pricing or profit reallocation adjustment is made by a DTA state, it can be expected that the Commissioner will seek to resolve the case by reaching a mutual understanding as to:
2. (a) the principles embodied in the DTA;
3. (b) the facts of the particular case; and
4. (c) how those principles should be applied to the facts of the case in a way which does not result in unrelieved double taxation.
68. Where  the  primary  adjustment  is  made  by  the  Commissioner,  the Commissioner  will  demonstrate  to  the  other  competent  authority  that  the transfer  pricing  or  profit  reallocation  adjustment  by  the  Commissioner  is  in accordance with the DTA and therefore, it is appropriate that relief from any resultant double tax should be provided by the other DTA state.

## Year of adjustment

69. Where the Commissioner provides relief from double taxation, it will, as a matter of practice, adjust the tax payable for the year of assessment whose basis period corresponds to the period for which the profits have been adjusted or reallocated by the other DTA state.

## Example 10

A  DTA  state  made  an  adjustment  to  increase  the  profits  of  the associated  enterprise  resident  there  in  relation  to  a  particular non-arm's  length  transaction  with  the  Hong  Kong  enterprise  that took  place  in  April  2005,  which  fell  within  its  accounting  period ended 31 March 2006.

Appropriate  relief  will  be  provided  for  the  Hong  Kong  enterprise against profits tax payable for the year of assessment 2005/06.

## Example 11

- A  DTA  state  increased  the  profits  of  the  associated  enterprise resident there by way of a primary adjustment relating to transactions with the Hong Kong enterprise during the year ended 31 December 2005.

Relief  will  be  provided  for  the  Hong  Kong  enterprise  against  tax payable for the year of assessment 2005/06 if the basis period for the Hong Kong enterprise was the year ended 31 December 2005.

70. Where either of the residents is, or both are, in a tax loss position in the year to which the primary adjustment relates, a correlative adjustment may be  made  to  the  profits/income  tax  payable  in  a  subsequent  year.    The Commissioner's practice in relation to the year for which relief is provided will depend  on  the  facts  of  each  case,  as  well  as  the  nature  and  timing  of  the relevant adjustments.
71. Where a DTA state provides relief from double taxation in response to  a  primary  adjustment  made  by  the  Commissioner,  the  method  of  the adjustment and the year to which it relates are matters to be determined by the tax administration of that DTA state.

## Competent authority communications

72. Communications between the competent authorities will usually be through an exchange of position papers.    Information provided by the resident taxpayer will be taken into account in the preparation of the Hong Kong SAR's position papers.
73. Where  a  case  involves  significant  issues  upon  which  agreement cannot  be  reached  through  the  exchange  of  position  papers,  the  competent authorities may meet for negotiations. The taxpayer does not have a right to be present at such negotiations. However, where both competent authorities agree, the taxpayer may personally present its case to the competent authorities jointly. Where the competent authority  of  a  DTA  state  does  not  agree  to  a joint  presentation,  the  taxpayer  will  nevertheless  be  given  an  opportunity  to present its case to the Commissioner.
74. The  Commissioner  will  endeavour  to  ensure  that  communications are undertaken on a timely basis to facilitate resolution of cases as quickly as possible. Taxpayers will be kept informed of the progress by the Commissioner.
75. Exchanges of information between competent authorities are undertaken under the Exchange of Information Article of the relevant DTA and will be subject to the secrecy provisions of that Article.

## Time for resolution of cases

76. Specific provisions in a DTA  dealing with time limits for implementation of competent authority agreement under the Mutual Agreement Procedure  Article  take  precedence  over  the  normal  domestic  law  time  limits that  would  otherwise  apply  to  the  provision  of  relief  from  double  taxation. The DTAs of the Hong Kong SAR invariably include a provision in the Mutual Agreement Procedure Article which states that any agreement reached shall be implemented  notwithstanding  any  time  limits  in  the  domestic  laws  of  the contracting  parties. This  means  that  the  taxpayer  can  rest  assured  that,  by presenting  a  case  to  the  competent  authority  under  the  Mutual  Agreement Procedure  Article,  the  mere  expiration  of  domestic  time  limits  does  not preclude the granting of relief.

## Interaction between mutual agreement procedure and objection rights under the IRO

77. The Mutual Agreement Procedure Article in the DTAs of the Hong Kong  SAR  provides  taxpayers  with  an  avenue  for  review  in  addition  to  the rights:
2. (a) to  object  to  an  assessment  or  a  reassessment  under  section 64(1) of the IRO; and
3. (b) to dispute the amount of a tax credit under section 50(9) of the IRO.
78. The Commissioner will consider concurrently a case presented to her under the Mutual Agreement Procedure Article and an objection lodged by the taxpayer under the provisions of the IRO.
79. Competent authority consideration will cease under a Mutual Agreement Procedure  Article  where  a  decision  to  wholly  allow  an  objection has been made, since there will no longer be taxation that is not in accordance with the DTA.

## Where competent authority agreement is reached

80. An appropriate solution arrived at by both competent authorities may result in the Commissioner either:
2. (a) restoring the taxpayer's original tax position by withdrawing the primary adjustment; or
3. (b) reducing  the  primary  adjustment  with  the  agreement  of  the taxpayer.
81. Where the primary adjustment is reduced with the agreement of the taxpayer,  the  terms  of  the  agreement  will  be  recorded  in  writing  and  the necessary adjustments will be made in accordance with section 64(3) if a valid objection has been lodged in the first instance.    Where the Commissioner fails

to  agree  with  the  taxpayer  as  to  the  amount  of  the  primary  adjustment,  the Commissioner will make a determination under section 64(4).

82. Where  an  assessment  or  additional  assessment  challenged  by  the taxpayer  involves  a  number  of  issues  (e.g.  a  transfer  pricing  adjustment  in relation to an interest free loan and a profit reallocation adjustment between the head office and its foreign branch), a settlement agreement entered into by the taxpayer  with  the  Commissioner  may  be  limited  to  those  issues  resolved mutually by the competent authorities. This means that the taxpayer may still proceed  with  domestic  objection  and  appeal  rights  in  relation  to  the  issues unresolved through the Mutual Agreement Procedure.

## Where taxpayer does not agree with competent authority agreement

83. Where  competent authorities have reached agreement but the taxpayer does not agree with the implementation of the agreement, the taxpayer can continue to seek relief using its domestic objection and appeal rights, if still applicable. The competent authorities generally will not communicate further on the matter.

## Where competent authority agreement has not been reached

84. Where  competent  authorities  have  not  agreed  on  an  appropriate solution  to  the  case  by  the  time  the  Commissioner  determines  an  objection under  section  64(4),  the  taxpayer  has  a  right  to  appeal  to  Board  of  Review under  section  66  if  dissatisfied  with  the  determination.    The  continuation  or otherwise  of  endeavours  by  the  competent  authorities  under  the  Mutual Agreement  Procedure  Article  during  the  objection  and  appeal  stages  will  be considered on a case by case basis.
85. Taxpayers  should  take  into  account  the  possibility  that  endeavours by  the  competent  authorities  may  cease  at  the  objection  and  appeal  stages. Sufficient  time  must  be  made  available  to  the  competent  authorities  to  reach agreement to resolve the case, otherwise a taxpayer may have to rely only on the  applicable  domestic  objection  and  appeal  rights  (or  any  rights  available under the laws of the other DTA state).

86. The Commissioner would take action to give effect to a decision of the  Board  of  Review  or  an  order  of  the  courts  which  is  either  wholly  or partially in the taxpayer's favour. Once a decision of the Board of Review or an  order  of  the  courts  has  been  made,  the  Commissioner  will  abide  by  that decision  or  order.  The  subsequent  endeavours  of  the  Commissioner  as  the competent  authority  under  a  DTA  will  be  limited  to  demonstrating  to  the competent authority of the other DTA state that the transfer pricing or profit reallocation adjustment by the Commissioner is in accordance with the DTA in terms of principle and amount, and that relief should be provided by that DTA state.

## Interaction  between  mutual  agreement  procedure  and  review  rights  in  the other DTA state

87. The  Mutual  Agreement  Procedure  Article  provides  a  process  to resolve  problems  in  addition  to  any  objection,  review  and  appeal  rights  that may be available to a resident taxpayer or its non-resident associated enterprise under the respective laws of both DTA states.
88. The successful exercise of objection, review and appeal rights in the other DTA state may give rise to the result that there is no longer any taxation which  is  contrary  to  the  DTA. Under  these  circumstances,  it  would  be inappropriate for the taxpayer to obtain any correlative relief in the Hong Kong SAR.
89. Depending upon the circumstances of each case, the provision of any correlative adjustment by the Commissioner will be conditional upon either:
4. (a) the resident taxpayer and any non-resident associated enterprise  having  exhausted  or  rescinded  objection,  review and appeal rights in the other DTA state; or
5. (b) the  resident  taxpayer  in  a  transfer  pricing  adjustment  case agreeing to advise the Commissioner should objection, review and appeal rights be exercised by the non-resident associated enterprise in the other DTA state; or

- (c) the resident taxpayer in a profit reallocation case agreeing to advise the Commissioner should objection, review and appeal rights be exercised in the other DTA state.
90. In relation to the situations outlined under (b) or (c) in paragraph 89 above,  the  issue  of  any  revised  assessment  or  the  provision  of  a  credit  for foreign taxes paid will be deferred until such time as the objection, review and appeal rights in the other DTA state have lapsed or are subsequently rescinded or exhausted.

## Payment of tax during mutual agreement procedure

91. In respect of a case which has been presented to the Commissioner, a taxpayer may apply to hold over under section 71 the profits tax payable if a valid objection under section 64 has been lodged. Each request to hold over the payment of tax under objection will be decided on its merits in accordance with Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 6.
