## INTRODUCTION

## Regulatory frameworks on retirement schemes

In recognition of the need to provide retirement benefits to employees,  tax  relief  in  relation  to  the  setting  up  of  and  benefits  withdrawn from retirement schemes was made available to employers and employees as early  as  1955.    The  tax  concessions  and  administration  provisions  in  the Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  (IRO)  evolved  with  the  development  of  more sophisticated  regulatory  frameworks  on  retirement  schemes  in  Hong  Kong. Major changes were made in 1993 following the introduction of the Occupational Retirement Schemes Ordinance (Cap. 426) (ORSO) and in 1998 to pave the way for the implementation of the mandatory provident fund (MPF) system.

2. The  Mandatory  Provident  Fund  Schemes  Ordinance  (Cap.  485) (MPFSO), enacted in 1995, provides for the operations and regulations of the MPF system in Hong Kong.    The MPFSO has been continually amended to refine the administration, operation and enforcement of the MPF system since its full operation in December 2000.    Schedule 3B to the IRO has been amended to  increase  the  maximum  amount of  deduction  allowable  under  sections  16AA and 26G to align with the increase of the maximum level of relevant income for MPF  mandatory  contributions.    The  Mandatory  Provident  Fund  Schemes (Amendment)  Ordinance  2015,  enacted  in  January  2015,  amended  the  IRO, inter alia, to extend the tax exemption to cover withdrawal of accrued benefits by instalments and on the ground of terminal illness.    The Inland Revenue and MPF Schemes Legislation (Tax Deductions  for  Annuity  Premiums  and  MPF Voluntary  Contributions)  (Amendment)  Ordinance  2019,  enacted  in  March 2019, provides tax incentives for MPF scheme members to make tax deductible MPF voluntary contributions (TVC) starting from 1 April 2019.
3. This Departmental Interpretation and Practice Note (DIPN) explains the  principal  features  in  the  IRO  in  so  far  as  they  affect  employers  and employees  in  regard  to  contributions  to  and  withdrawals  from  retirement schemes.    It  was  revised  in  September  2006,  incorporating  the  legislative amendments  on  MPF  contributions  and  other  changes  in  practice.    Having reviewed the tax treatment for defined benefit schemes, and taking into account the  recent  legislative  amendments,  it  is  considered  appropriate  to  revise  this DIPN to bring it up-to-date.

## DIFFERENT RETIREMENT SCHEMES

## Approved retirement schemes

4. Before the commencement of the ORSO in October 1993, there was no  statutory  body  in  Hong  Kong  to  regulate  the  operations  of  retirement schemes  established for the benefits of  employees. At that time, the Commissioner approved retirement schemes that satisfied the conditions set out in the Inland Revenue (Retirement Scheme) Rules as approved retirement (AR) schemes under section 87A (repealed).    Tax relief was granted to AR schemes.

## Recognized occupational retirement schemes

5. After the ORSO came into operation in October 1993, the Registrar of Occupational Retirement Schemes assumed responsibility for the registration  and  regulation  of  retirement  schemes.    Following  the  repeal  of section 87A of the IRO and the Inland Revenue (Retirement Scheme) Rules by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 5) Ordinance 1993 in November 1993, the Commissioner ceased to approve retirement schemes.
6. The  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  (No.  5)  Ordinance  1993  also brought about a number of other changes to the IRO that had an impact on both salaries  tax  and  profits  tax,  reinstating  those  requirements  contained  in  the repealed Inland Revenue  (Retirement  Scheme)  Rules. In the main, it preserved the practical position that had long prevailed under those Rules.

## Mandatory provident fund schemes

7. In  the  MPF  system,  a  mandatory  provident  fund  (MPF)  scheme means a provident fund scheme as defined under section 2(1) of the MPFSO and registered under that ordinance.    Except for the exempt persons stipulated in the MPFSO, the MPF system covers employees and self-employed persons aged between 18 and 65.    Under the MPFSO, employers are required to enrol employees in an MPF scheme.    Every MPF scheme has to be registered with the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA).    Persons exempt from MPF schemes include:

- (a) domestic employees;
- (b) self-employed hawkers;
- (c) people covered by statutory pension or provident fund schemes, such as civil servants and subsidized or grant school teachers;
- (d) members  of  occupational retirement schemes  which are granted MPF exemption certificates;
- (e) people from overseas who enter Hong Kong for employment for not more than 13 months, or who are covered by overseas retirement schemes; and
- (f) employees  of  the  European  Union  Office  of  the  European Commission in Hong Kong.

Details  relating  to  the  operations  of  the  MPF  system  can  be  found  on  the website of the MPFA at www.mpfa.org.hk .

## Recognized retirement schemes

8. Before going into detail about the tax treatments of contributions to and  benefits  received  from  retirement  schemes  under  different  regimes,  it  is necessary to refer to the meaning of various schemes as they appear in the IRO and their significance.
9. The term 'recognized occupational retirement  scheme'  (ROR scheme) is defined to  include those  AR  schemes where the approval has  not been  withdrawn,  schemes  registered  under  the  ORSO  or  exempted  from registration under the ORSO, schemes established by a foreign government or its non-profit making agencies, schemes established under other ordinances, etc. The term 'mandatory provident fund scheme' means a provident fund scheme registered under the MPFSO.
10. The collective term 'recognized retirement scheme' covers an ROR scheme or an MPF scheme, the two types of retirement schemes that may enjoy tax benefits.

11. The  change  from  one  regime  to  the  next  very  often  involved  the winding up of schemes registered under a previous regime and the establishing of a scheme under the following regime.    When ORSO came into operation, schemes previously approved by the Commissioner under section 87A (repealed)  could  be  registered  upon  application  as  an  ROR  scheme.    The Commissioner's  approval  under  section  87A  (repealed)  was  deemed  to  have been withdrawn when a scheme became an ROR scheme or if the scheme was not so registered by 15 October 1993. Similarly, on or before the commencement of the MPF contribution provisions on 1 December 2000, there were options available to employers operating an ROR scheme in changing to schemes under the MPF system.    The options included the following:
2. (a) the  ORSO  scheme  was  converted  to  an  MPF-exempted ORSO scheme (upon application and subject to approval by the  MPFA)  and  either  the  employer  did  not  establish  an MPF scheme or the employer established an MPF scheme to  operate  concurrently  with  the  MPF-exempted  ORSO scheme;
3. (b) the ORSO scheme was retained to provide top-up benefits and the employer  established  an  MPF  scheme  in  which  all employees were enrolled;
4. (c) the ORSO scheme was wound-up and the employer established an MPF scheme.

Different options can have  different taxation implications and  they are elaborated in paragraphs below.

## IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS

## Distinction between 'retirement' and 'termination of service'

12. For the purposes of the exemption provisions of section 8(2)(c) and (cc)  of  the  IRO,  the  terms,  'retirement'  and  'termination  of  service',  are defined in section 8(3).    'Retirement' means:

- (a) a  retirement  from  the  service  of  the  employer  at  some specified age of not less than 45 years; or
- (b) a  retirement  after  some  specified  period  of  service  with  the employer of not less than 10 years; or
- (c) the  attainment  of  the  age  of  60  or  some  specified  age  of retirement, whichever is the later.

'Termination of service' means a termination of employment other than upon retirement, death, incapacity or terminal illness. Withdrawals from recognized  retirement  schemes  on  retirement  and  those  on  termination  of service have different tax implications.

## Contributions to MPF schemes

13. Employers,  employees  and  self-employed  persons  are  required  to make contributions to the MPF schemes they have joined out of or by reference to  the  income  of  the  employees  or  the  self-employed  persons.    In  general, contributions  can  be  classified  into  mandatory  contributions  and  voluntary contributions.    Mandatory  contributions  and  voluntary  contributions  attract different tax treatments.

## Mandatory contributions

14. For  the  purposes  of  the  IRO,  mandatory  contribution  means  the mandatory contribution paid to an MPF scheme in accordance with the MPFSO. It is calculated on the basis of 10% on an employee's relevant income, with the employer  and  the  employee  each  paying  5%.    Contributions  are  generally made on a monthly basis.    The employer's mandatory contributions shall be payable from the first day of employment.    There is a 30-day non-contributory period for an employee who takes up a new employment.    The employee is also not required to make  employee's  mandatory  contributions  for  any incomplete payroll period immediately following the 30-day non-contributory period (if the employee's payroll period is monthly or shorter than monthly) or the  calendar  month  in  which  the  30 th day  of  employment  falls  (if  the employee's payroll period is longer than monthly). The initial

non-contributory period does not apply to employers.    Self-employed persons 1 have  to  contribute  5%  of  their  relevant  income.    They  can  opt  to  make contributions on a monthly or yearly basis.

15. Employees  earning  less  than  the  minimum  level  of  the  relevant income are not required to contribute, but their employers have to contribute 5% of their relevant income.    The mandatory contribution is capped at 5% of the  maximum  relevant  income.    These  maximum  and  minimum  levels  of income also apply to self-employed persons.    The past and current minimum and maximum relevant income levels are set out below:

| Effective date   | Minimum relevant income level   | Maximum relevant income level   | Mandatory contribution capped@5%   |
|------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1 December 2000  | $4,000                          | $20,000                         | $1,000                             |
| 1 February 2003  | $5,000                          | $20,000                         | $1,000                             |
| 1 November 2011  | $6,500                          | $20,000                         | $1,000                             |
| 1 June 2012      | $6,500                          | $25,000                         | $1,250                             |
| 1 November 2013  | $7,100                          | $25,000                         | $1,250                             |
| 1 June 2014      | $7,100                          | $30,000                         | $1,500                             |

16. Before  1  November  2008,  housing  allowance  and  other  housing benefit were excluded from the definition of 'relevant income', under section 2(1) of the MPFSO, for the purposes of calculating the mandatory contributions. Thereafter,  the  term  'relevant  income'  means  any  wages,  salaries,  leave  pay, fee,  commission,  bonus,  gratuity,  perquisite  or  allowance  (including  housing allowance  or  other  housing  benefit),  expressed  in  monetary  terms,  paid  or payable by an employer (directly or indirectly) to that employee in consideration  of  his  employment  under  that  contract,  but  excludes  severance and long service payments under the Employment Ordinance (Cap. 57).    The relevant  income  of  a  self-employed  person  is  basically  his  assessable  profits calculated in accordance with the IRO, as shown in his most recent notice of assessment.

1 In general, sole proprietors and partners in a partnership business are regarded as self-employed persons.

## Voluntary contributions

17. In  addition  to  mandatory  contributions,  employers,  employees  and self-employed persons can make contributions or increase their contributions to an  MPF  scheme  on  a  voluntary  basis  in  accordance  with  section  11  of  the MPFSO.    MPF voluntary contributions, other than TVC, made by employees and self-employed persons are not deductible for tax purposes.

## Tax deductible MPF voluntary contributions

18. With  effect  from  1  April  2019,  deduction  in  respect  of  TVC  paid into  a  TVC  account  during  a  year  of  assessment  is  allowable  under  section 26S(1) to a person chargeable to salaries tax or tax under personal assessment. A TVC account receives TVC made by a TVC account holder, and also holds the  account  holder's  accrued  benefits  derived  from  those  TVC  and  the  TVC transferred to the account from other TVC accounts.
19. A person may open a TVC account in a registered MPF scheme if the  person  holds  a  contribution  account  or  personal  account  in  the  registered scheme; or is a member of an ORSO scheme in respect of which an exemption has  been  granted  under  section  5  of  the  MPFSO.    A  contribution  account primarily receives MPF  contributions attributable to a person's current employment or current self-employment for investment.    A personal account primarily receives accrued benefits attributable to a person's former employment or former self-employment transferred from other MPF accounts, and  also  accrued  benefits  attributable  to  the  person's  current  employment transferred from a contribution account for investment.
20. TVC means tax deductible MPF voluntary contributions that a person pays into a TVC account which holds the person's accrued benefits derived from those contributions and the person's accrued benefits transferred to the account.
21. The total deductions allowable to the person in respect of qualifying annuity premiums and TVC cannot exceed the amount specified in Schedule 3F as  per  Section  26U(1).    See  DIPN  No.  57  on  'Concessionary  Deductions: Section 26N to 26U Annuity Premiums and MPF Voluntary Contributions' for further details.    For the year of assessment 2019/20 and subsequent years, the maximum  deduction  is  specified  at  $60,000  and  it  is  an  aggregate  limit  for qualifying annuity premiums and TVC.

22. Like MPF  mandatory contributions, TVC  is subject to the preservation  requirements,  meaning  that  withdrawal  is  allowed  only  upon retirement  at  the  age  of  65  or  on  statutorily  permissible  grounds  (including early retirement at the age of 60, permanent departure from Hong Kong, total incapacity, terminal illness, small balance and death).

## ASSESSABILITY OF SUMS RECEIVED BY EMPLOYEES

## Amounts attracting salaries tax liability

23. Persons with income arising in or derived from Hong Kong from an office or employment are chargeable to salaries tax.    Definition of the    term 'income from office or employment' is provided in section 9(1).    Other than pensions, which are specifically chargeable under section 8(1)(b), assessability of amounts received by an employee from retirement schemes, whether by way of commutation or otherwise, is as follows:
2. (a) amounts received from a pension or provident fund, scheme or society which is not an ROR scheme or an MPF scheme, as is attributable to the employer's contributions, are chargeable per section 9(1)(aa);
3. (b) where  the  amount  from  an  ROR  scheme  is  received  not because of termination of service, death, incapacity, terminal illness or retirement of the employee, the full amount of the employer's contributions  under  the  scheme  in  respect  of  the employee concerned is chargeable per section 9(1)(ab)(i);
4. (c) where the amount is received from an ROR scheme because of  termination  of  service,  the  amount  of  the  employer's contributions that exceeds the proportionate benefit as calculated  in  accordance  with  section  8(5)  is  chargeable  per section 9(1)(ab)(ii);
5. (d) any payment received by an employee, pursuant to a judgment  given  under  section  57(3)(b)  of  the  ORSO  that  is attributable to his employer's contributions to the occupational retirement scheme  in  respect of  which  the

- judgment  was  given is chargeable per section 9(1)(ac). Section 57(3) of the ORSO allows the Court to determine the amount  of  any  shortfall  in  the  funding  of  a  beneficiary's vested benefits under a scheme and to make an order against the employer for that shortfall;
- (e) so much of the accrued benefit that an employee has received, or is taken to have received, from an MPF scheme otherwise than on the ground of retirement, death, incapacity, terminal illness or termination of service whether in a lump sum or by instalments, as is attributable to his employer's contributions to the scheme, is chargeable per section 9(1)(ad);
- (f) so much of the accrued benefit that an employee has received, or  is  taken  to  have  received,  from  an  MPF  scheme,  as  is attributable  to  his  employer's  voluntary  contributions  to  the scheme which exceeds the proportionate benefit calculated in accordance with section 8(5), is chargeable per section 9(1)(ae).

After the employee's total income for a year of assessment has been ascertained in  accordance  with  the  above,  the  charging  provisions,  section  8(1),  (1A) and/or (1B) will be applied according to the employee's situations.

24. It should be noted that in the case of ROR schemes, liability arises when the amount is received, unless it is received under circumstances where exemptions  are  applicable.    Regarding  accrued  benefits  from  MPF  schemes, liability can arise when the benefit is taken to have been received.    In general, only benefits attributable to the employer's contributions to an ROR scheme or voluntary contributions to an MPF scheme (including investment return arising therefrom)  attract  salaries  tax  liability.    Accrued  benefits  or  sums  (including investment  return),  attributable  to  the  employee's  contributions,  withdrawn from the trust funds are not chargeable to salaries tax.    Such withdrawals may be viewed as withdrawals of the employee's savings.

## Summary of the position

25. To  give symmetry  to  the assessment  provisions, section 8(2) contains  provisions  on  exemption  of  sums  or  accrued  benefits  received  from recognized retirement schemes.    Summary of the position is:

2 The  accrued  benefit  received  under  the  circumstance  is  not  regarded  as  income  in  section 9(1)(ad).

26. In the case of an ROR scheme that has lost its 'recognized' status, only relevant sums paid prior to the loss of that status can be considered for exemption under section 8(2)(c) or (cc).    All payments received subsequent to the revocation of recognition will be considered for assessment under section 9(1)(aa).
27. The  Chief  Executive  in  the  2018  Policy  Address  announced  the abolition of the arrangement for offsetting severance payment or long service payment  with  accrued  benefits  from  the  employer's  mandatory  contributions under the MPF system, and the preparatory work is actively being undertaken. Until the abolition becomes effective, if the employer has not paid the whole of the severance payment or long service payment to an employee as required by the Employment Ordinance, the employee may, by virtue of section 12A(3) and (4) of the MPFSO, require the approved trustee of the MPF scheme to pay him the shortfall out of the accrued benefit attributable to the employer's contribution.    Example 5 below illustrates the situation which involves setting off of severance payment or long service payment against the taxable accrued benefits  received.    Sums  received  by  the  employee  attributable  to  voluntary contributions of the employer are exempt under section 8(2)(cc)(ii), subject to the  proportionate  benefit  rule  and  the  restriction  under  section  8(7)  and  (8). Example  12  below  illustrates  the  application  of  these  sections  and  their relationship  with  section  8(4)  and  (5).    Sums  received  attributable  to  the employer's mandatory contributions are not taxable.

## Proportionate benefit

28. Special  conditions  apply  to  limit  the  amount  of  the  employer's voluntary contribution component of any payment received upon termination of service that  may  be exempted from salaries tax under section 8(2)(c) or (cc). The  maximum  amount  that  is  exempt  from  salaries  tax  is  the  lesser  of  the relevant  amount  received  or  the  proportionate  benefit.    Mathematically,  the proportionate benefit is calculated using the formula set out in section 8(5):

Proportionate benefit    =    Accrued benefit × Completed months of service 120

## Accrued benefit

29. For the purposes of computing the proportionate benefit in section 8(5), accrued benefit is defined in section 8(6) to mean:
2. (a) if  a  person  is  a  member of an ROR scheme, accrued benefit refers  to  the  maximum  benefit  that  the  person  would  have been entitled to receive from the scheme as if the person had retired when his employment was terminated; and
3. (b) if  a  person  is  a  member of an MPF scheme, accrued benefit refers  to  that  benefit  which  is  attributable  to  the  employer's voluntary contribution in respect of the person for his service.
30. Where  an  ROR  scheme  contains  more  than  one  method  for calculating  the  retirement  benefit  that  would  have  been  payable  on  that  date, the option which provides the greatest benefit to the employee is to be used. In  the  case  of  a  defined  contribution  scheme,  the  accrued  benefit  will  be  the sum attributable  to  the  aggregate  contributions  made  by  or  in  respect  of  that person  and  investment  return  arising  therefrom.    In  the  case  of  a  defined benefit scheme, the accrued benefit must be calculated in accordance with the method  recommended  by  the  actuaries  of  the  scheme.    Actuaries  are  not required  to  obtain  the  Commissioner's  approval  for  the  calculation  method recommended for any scheme.    However, if a particular recommended method has  resulted  in  an  accrued  benefit  which  appears  to  be  somewhat  excessive, after  taking  into  account  the  period  of  employment  and  the  salary  received during that period, the Commissioner may obtain independent actuarial advice. In this regard, taxpayers will, of course, have the usual right of objection and appeal in respect of the chargeable income calculation.
31. Under  an  MPF  scheme,  mandatory  contributions  paid  for  and  in respect of an employee are fully and immediately vested in the employee once they are paid to the MPF trustee.    Investment return attributable to mandatory contributions is also fully and immediately vested in the employee. Conversely, the employer's voluntary contributions under an MPF scheme are made on a voluntary basis and are not subject to the preservation, vesting and portability requirements as stipulated in the MPFSO.    Any investment return derived  from  investment  of  the  employer's  voluntary  contributions  under  an MPF scheme is subject to a vesting scale under the governing rules drawn up

by the employer.    The employer's voluntary contributions held by a trustee of an MPF scheme are subject to forfeiture if the conditions are not fulfilled, or in the  event  that  the  employee  resigns,  or  is  dismissed  due  to  misconduct,  etc. At the time when the employer's voluntary contributions are paid to the trustee of an MPF scheme, the employee only receives a promise with respect to such contributions.    The  employee  is  only  entitled  to  claim  payment  when  the employer's voluntary contributions (including investment return derived therefrom) are vested in the employee free of all conditions.

32. The nature of the employer's voluntary contributions under an MPF scheme  is  no  different  from  the  employer's  contributions  under  an  ROR scheme 3 .    Thus, for the purposes of computing the proportionate benefit, the amount  of  the  employee's  accrued  benefit  attributable  to  the  employer's voluntary contributions paid to the MPF scheme should be accorded with that attributable  to  the  employer's  contributions  paid  to  the  ROR  scheme.    The words 'attributable to' in this context refer to the investment of the employer's contributions,  which  include  employer's  contributions,  whether  mandatory  or voluntary,  and  investment  return  arising  therefrom.    In  other  words,  the accrued  benefit  is  equal  to  the  vested  balance  of  the  investment  of  the employer's  voluntary  contributions  under  the  MPF  scheme  or  contributions under  an  ROR scheme.    The  investment  return  derived  from  the  employer's voluntary contributions under an MPF scheme or contributions under an ROR scheme is not to be excluded.

## Completed months of service

33. This term refers to the number of completed months of service that the employee has completed with the employer.    It is referable to the whole period  of  employment  that  the  employee  had  with  the  employer.    This  term should not be confused with the number of days or months that the employee has rendered services in Hong Kong for the purposes of section 8(1A) and/or (1B).

3 Excluding  employees  who  join  MPF-exempted  ORSO  schemes  after  1  December  2000.    The Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes (Exemption) Regulation stipulates that accrued benefits in respect of an employee who joined an ORSO scheme after the launch of the MPF System on 1 December 2000 are subject to the preservation, portability and withdrawal requirements up to an amount equivalent to the minimum MPF benefits.

34. Where there has been a transfer of benefit from a scheme operated by a previous employer to the current employer's scheme, the service with the previous employer  that has been  recognized by the present  scheme  as qualifying  service  with  the  current  employer  can  be  taken  into  account  in calculating the completed months of service.

## Illustrative examples

35. The following examples illustrate the application of the proportionate benefit calculation.    In all cases, the 'accrued  benefit' and the 'payment received' are the respective amounts attributable to the employer's voluntary contributions only.

## Example 1

- (a) Period of service: 5 years
- (b) Accrued benefit on termination of service: $100,000
- (c) Payment received from the scheme: $50,000

- (c) Employer would pay severance payment according to Employment Ordinance after setting off the accrued benefits attributed  to  the  Employer' s  contributions,  both  mandatory and voluntary, under the MPF scheme.
- (d) Severance payment was calculated as: $22,500 × 2/3 × 5 = $75,000
- (e) Accrued  benefit  attributable  to  the  Employer's  mandatory contributions  $40,000  and  voluntary  contributions  $30,000 under the scheme was paid to Employee upon request.
- (f) Severance  payment  received  from  Employer  after  setting  off the  accrued  benefit  in  (e)  above:  $75,000  -  ($40,000  + $30,000) = $5,000

## Example 6

- (a) Employee was seconded to Hong Kong for 1 year after having been employed by Employer for 10 years outside Hong Kong.
- (b) Period of employment as at the date of termination of service: 11 years
- (c) Employee  joined  an  overseas  Retirement  Plan  prior  to  and during his Hong Kong secondment.
- (d) The Retirement Plan qualified as an ROR  scheme  and Employee  was  exempt  from  joining  a  MPF  scheme  in  Hong Kong.
- (e) Accrued benefit on termination of service: $100,000
- (f) Payment received from Retirement Plan: $100,000

Employee  was  under  the  same  employment  for  11  years.    The number  of completed months of services of  Employee with Employer  was  132.    No  taxable  benefit  would  arise  since  the accrued benefit attributable to the Employer's voluntary contributions  $100,000  was  less  than  the  proportionate  benefit $110,000.

## Example 7

- (a) Employee had an employment with Employer-1 outside Hong Kong  for  10  years  when  he  was  covered  by  an  overseas Retirement Plan. Period of service with Employer-1: 10 years
- (b) Employee ceased his employment with Employer-1 and employed under a new employment by Employer-2, which was a group company in Hong Kong.    Employee was covered by an MPF scheme and his period of service with Employer-2: 1 year
- (c) Period of service recognized by Employer-2: 11 years
- (d) Voluntary  contributions  made  by  Employer-2  to  the  MPF scheme: $90,000 (subject to the vesting scale)
- (e) Accrued benefits on termination of service: $100,000
- (f) Payment received from an MPF scheme: $100,000

Calculation of proportionate benefit per section 8(5):

=  $10,000

Calculation of taxable benefit per section 8(4):

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Employer-1  and  Employer-2,  which  were  within  the  same  group, were separate legal entities.    Benefits were not transferred from the Retirement  Plan  to  the  MPF  scheme.    Though  Employer-1  and Employer-2  were  group  companies,  the completed  months  of service  in  the  formula  for  calculating  proportionate  benefit  should not cover the employment period with Employer-1 (i.e. 10 years or 120 months).

## Withdrawal of MPF benefits

## Early withdrawal of accrued benefit

36. Accrued benefit arising from mandatory contributions made by the employer  and  employee  has  to  be  preserved  until  the  employee  attains  the retirement  age  of  65  as  stipulated  in  the  MPFSO.    Early  withdrawal  of  the accrued  benefit  is  however  allowed  in  the  circumstances  applicable  to  the employee as follows:

- (a) early retirement and attainment of age 60;
- (b) permanent departure from Hong Kong;
- (c) total incapacity;
- (d) terminal illness;
- (e) having  a  small  balance  account  of  less  than  $5,000  and providing that the employee has not made contributions to a scheme for 12 months and has declared to retire; and
- (f) death.

Permanent departure from Hong Kong without termination of service

37. Section 158(2) of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes (General) Regulation (Cap. 485 sub. leg. A) provides that a scheme member departs from Hong  Kong  permanently  if  the  member  departs  from  Hong  Kong  to  reside elsewhere with no intention of returning for employment or to resettle in Hong Kong  as  a  permanent  resident.    Section  9(1)(ad)  of  the  IRO  provides  that income from any employment includes the accrued benefit that an  employee has  received,  or  is  taken  to  have  received,  from  an  MPF  scheme  (otherwise than on  the ground  of  retirement, death, incapacity, terminal illness or termination  of  service,  whether  in  a  lump  sum  or  (if  applicable)  as  an instalment),  as  is  attributable  to  contributions  paid  to  the  scheme  by  his employer.    However,  under  section  8(2)(cb),  specific  exemption  has  been accorded  to  accrued  benefit  received  from  the  approved  trustee  of  an  MPF scheme,  whether  in  a  lump  sum  or  (if  applicable)  as  an  instalment,  on  the

ground of a person's retirement from employment, death, incapacity, terminal illness or permanent departure from Hong Kong, as is attributable to mandatory contributions.    The net effect of these two provisions is that for cases where there  is  permanent  departure  from  Hong  Kong  but  without  termination  of service,  the  accrued  benefit  received  which  is  attributable  to  the  employer's mandatory contributions is not taxable, but that attributable to the employer's voluntary  contributions  is  taxed  in  full.    On  the  other  hand,  if  the  accrued benefit is to remain with the scheme and only paid out to the employee when one of the exemption conditions is satisfied (e.g. retirement), there should be no tax liability.

## Incapacity

38. The term 'incapacity', as defined in section 8(3) of the IRO, means permanent  unfitness  to  perform  the  kind  of  work  that  a  person  was  last performing  before  becoming  incapacitated.    A  person  who  applies  for  early withdrawal of accrued benefit on the ground of incapacity should have already ceased employment or self-employment in the particular kind of work that the person  was  last  engaged  before  becoming  totally  incapacitated.    Before making such an application, the person must obtain proof that he has become permanently unfit to perform the particular kind of work he was doing in his previous  job.    In  addition,  his  previous  employment  has  been  terminated. Accrued benefit withdrawn on the ground of incapacity is exempt from salaries tax.

## Terminal illness

39. With  effect  from  1  August  2015,  'terminal  illness'  became  an additional ground for early withdrawal of accrued benefit.    The definition of 'terminal illness' in section 8(3) adopts the same meaning of section 158(3) of the  Mandatory  Fund  Schemes  (General)  Regulation  (Cap.  485  sub.  leg.  A). Terminal illness refers to an illness that is likely to reduce the life expectancy of  the  person  to  12  months  or  less.    The  person  who  applies  for  early withdrawal of accrued benefit on the ground of terminal illness must obtain a medical  certificate  from  a  registered  medical  practitioner  or  a  registered Chinese  medicine  practitioner.    There  is  no  specific  list  of  diseases  that  are considered to constitute terminal illness.    The terminally-ill person can still be employed or self-employed.    Similar to other special circumstances for early withdrawal, accrued benefit so withdrawn is exempt from salaries tax.

## Withdrawal of accrued benefit by instalments

40. Starting from 1 February 2016, MPF accrued benefits are allowed to be withdrawn by instalments upon retirement or early retirement. Applications should be submitted directly to the relevant trustees.    There is no limit  on  the  amount  of  each  instalment  or  the  number  of  withdrawals. Trustees must not charge any fee, impose any penalty or make any deduction from the scheme members' accounts, other than necessary transaction costs (e.g. costs in selling and buying investments) for the payment of accrued benefits by instalments in any year for the first four instalments of that year.    As for early withdrawal  of  accrued  benefits  on  the  ground  of  permanent  departure  from Hong  Kong,  total incapacity, terminal illness or having small balance, withdrawal  of  MPF  accrued  benefits  by  instalments  is  not  allowed.    Under such special circumstances, accrued benefits are allowed to be withdrawn in a lump sum.    For members of ROR schemes, the equivalent of their mandatory contributions (i.e. minimum MPF benefits) will normally be transferred to an MPF scheme  upon  termination  of  employment,  and  the  additional  option  of withdrawal  by  instalments  will  be  available  to  them  upon  such  a  transfer. Withdrawal of accrued benefits by instalments will not be subject  to salaries tax.

## Accrued benefit received or taken to have been received from MPF schemes

41. Under the MPF system, it is permissible for an employee who has terminated  his  service  with  an  employer  to  retain  his  accrued  benefit  in  the same MPF scheme to which his former employer has made contribution, or to transfer  the  accrued  benefit  to  another  MPF  scheme,  for  example,  one sponsored by his new employer.    In both situations, the employee is taken to have received the accrued benefit pursuant to section 8(9).
42. Section  8(2)(cb)  exempts  accrued  benefit  received  from  an  MPF scheme,  whether  in  a  lump  sum  or  (if  applicable)  as  an  instalment,  on  the ground of a person's retirement from employment, death, incapacity, terminal illness or permanent departure from Hong Kong as is attributable to mandatory contribution.    The  situation  described  in  the  foregoing  paragraph  (i.e.  an employee terminating his service) does not fall within the exemption provisions of section 8(2)(cb).    On the other hand, section 9(1)(ad) excludes as income the  accrued  benefit  from  an  MPF  scheme  received  or  taken  to  have  been received  on  the  ground  of  retirement,  death,  incapacity,  terminal  illness  or

termination  of  service,  whether  in  a  lump  sum  or  (if  applicable)  as  an instalment, as  is attributable to the employer's contributions (both mandatory and  voluntary).    When  the  above  provisions  are  taken  together,  the  accrued benefit  attributable  to  the  employer's  mandatory  contributions  in  situation  of termination  of  service  and  transfer  of  the  benefit  to  another  MPF  scheme should  be  exempt.    Accrued  benefit  attributable  to  the  employer's  voluntary contributions  in  the  same  situation  should  also  be  exempt  but  subject  to  the proportionate  benefit  rule.    By  virtue  of  section  9(1)(ae),  so  much  of  the accrued benefit that an employee has received or is taken to have received from an MPF scheme as is attributable to the employer's voluntary contributions that exceeds the proportionate benefit will be included as the employee's income.

43. There  are  situations  involving  transfer  of  benefit  from  one  MPF scheme to another but without termination of service or any of the exemption conditions  being  satisfied.    For  example,  the  employer  sets  up  a  new  MPF scheme  and  transfers  all  employees  from  the  old  MPF  scheme  to  the  new scheme,  or  there  is  a  transfer  of  benefit  upon  an  employee's  permanent departure from Hong Kong without termination of service.    In these kinds of situations, the employees should be taken to have received the accrued benefit attributable to the employer's contributions.    By virtue of section 9(1)(ad), the accrued  benefit  is  chargeable  to  tax  in  the  year  of  transfer.    The  exemption provisions in section 8(2)(cb) and (cc)(ii), which refer to receipts, whether in a lump sum or (if applicable) as an instalment, on the ground of retirement, death, incapacity, terminal illness or termination of service, would have no application. The expression 'taken to have received' in section 9(1)(ad) is interpreted no differently  from  that  used  in  section  8(9).    However,  the  Commissioner recognizes that, in the circumstances described above, the employee concerned has not actually received, and cannot choose to receive, the accrued benefit and the  benefit  may  be  subject  to  tax  again  when  it  is  finally  received  by  the employee.    As a concession, the Commissioner would not seek to assess the transferred benefit in the year of transfer if the transfer is not or part of a tax avoidance  arrangement.    The  chargeability  will  be  determined  when  it  is received by the employee or when there is a termination of service.
44. Following the implementation of the Employee Choice Arrangement  on  1  November  2012,  an  employee  may  opt,  once  a  year,  to transfer  the  accrued  benefit  derived  from  his  mandatory  contributions  in  an MPF scheme under current employment to another MPF scheme  of his own choice.    There  is  no  tax  implication  on  the  employee  upon  transfer  of  the

accrued benefit attributable to his mandatory contributions under the Employee Choice Arrangement.

## Changing from ROR schemes to MPF schemes

Application of section 8(4)

45. When  a  person  'switched'  from  a  AR  scheme  to  a  scheme established subsequently, a question may arise as to whether the vesting scale of  the  AR  scheme  can  be  carried  across  to  the  new  scheme  if  it  is  more advantageous  to  employees  than  the  proportionate  benefit  rule  itself.    The latter part of section 8(4) provides that where, in the case of an ROR scheme approved  by  the  Commissioner  under  section  87A  before  its  repeal  by  the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 5) Ordinance 1993, if an amount payable on termination of service in accordance with the rules of such scheme exceeds the proportionate benefit so calculated, the amount payable is to be taken as the proportionate benefit.
46. The  above  provision takes into consideration that there is a substitution of one scheme by another.    This may occur where the trustees of a scheme switch the funding from one investment vehicle to another in a way which entails termination of the scheme and its replacement by a new scheme. In this regard, if the substance of the new scheme is essentially the same as the original  scheme  (i.e.  identical  membership;  transfer  of  all  investments  and funds to the new scheme; no change to vesting scale; and terms and conditions relating  to  membership  and  members'  rights  substantially  unaltered)  it  will generally be treated on the basis that it represents a continuation of the original scheme.
47. For  illustration,  the  latter  part  of  section  8(4)  is  applied  in  the following situations:
4. (a) an  AR  scheme,  which  operated  as  an  ROR  scheme,  was converted into an MPF-exempted scheme; and
5. (b) the employer established an MPF scheme to replace the ROR scheme which was previously an AR scheme and employees were required to join the MPF scheme and the ROR scheme would be wound up; before the commencement of the MPF

contribution provisions on 1 December  2000,  employees transferred all their benefits from the ROR scheme to the new MPF scheme.

48. In the above  situations, the new  scheme  is  recognized  as a continuation of an earlier scheme, the Commissioner's approval of the earlier scheme under section 87A (repealed) will be preserved (i.e. it will be taken to apply  to  the  new  scheme).    Nevertheless,  changes  of  this  nature  should  be notified to the Commissioner within one month of implementation.
49. The  treatment  applicable  to  the  situation  mentioned  in  paragraph 47(b) is by concession only.    If a person was transferred from an ROR scheme to a new MPF scheme on or after the commencement of the MPF contribution provisions, the person's membership in the first scheme is considered to have ceased in all respects upon payment of the transfer value from the first scheme to the new scheme.    It follows that if a termination payment is subsequently received from the new scheme, it will be regarded as having arisen from that scheme.    In  this  situation,  the  proportionate  benefit  rule,  rather  than  the provision in the latter part of section 8(4), will apply to the payment.

Salaries tax implications to employees

50. Examples  8  to  11  below  illustrate  the  salaries  tax  liabilites  of employees in different situations.

## Example 8

Employer converted an existing ROR scheme to an MPF-exempted ORSO  scheme.  The  MPF-exempted  ORSO  scheme  could  remain open or closed to new members.

There was no tax implication for Employees upon conversion of the schemes.    The  scheme  remains  an  ROR  scheme.    Any  sum withdrawn upon  termination  of  service  was  exempt  subject  to  the proportionate  benefit  rule.    Withdrawal  upon  retirement,  death, incapacity or terminal illness was exempt.

## Example 9

Employer retained an existing ROR scheme, and at the same time an MPF scheme was set up.    Existing scheme members could join the MPF scheme, with the option to:

- (a) withdraw the  accrued  benefit  attributable  to  the  Employer' s contribution under the ROR scheme;
- (b) remain  in  the  ROR  scheme  to  provide  top-up  benefit  to  be received in future; or
- (c) transfer  the  accrued  benefit  attributable  to  the  Employer' s contribution from the ROR scheme to the MPF scheme.

The tax implication in respect of each option is as follows:

## Option (a)

The amount received was fully taxable.    None of the conditions for exemption (i.e. termination of service, retirement, death, incapacity and terminal illness) was satisfied.

## Option (b)

There  was  no  tax  implication  in  the  interim  as  no  payment  was received.    If  withdrawal  of  the  accrued  benefit  from  the  ROR scheme  was  made  only  when  one  or  more  of  the  conditions  for exemption were satisfied, the amount received was exempt, subject to  the  proportionate  benefit  rule  in  the  case  of  termination  of service.

## Option (c)

There  was  no  tax  implication  in  the  interim  as  no  payment  was received.    The accrued benefit would be treated as if it remained in the ROR scheme.    Alternatively, the accrued benefit transferred to the  MPF scheme was deemed to be a voluntary contribution from Employer  to  the  MPF  scheme.    If  withdrawal  of  the  accrued benefit  was  made  only  when  one  or  more  of  the  conditions  for exemption were satisfied, the amount received was exempt, subject to the proportionate benefit rule in the case of termination of service. The provision in the latter part of section 8(4) would only apply as a concession if the ROR  scheme  in  question qualified for its

application and the transfer of the accrued benefit took place before 1 December 2000.

## Example 10

The existing ROR scheme was wound up when Employer set up an MPF scheme which all employees were required to join.

The same considerations for options (a) and (c) in Example 9 would be relevant.

## Example 11

Employer retained an existing MPF scheme, and at the same time an ROR scheme was set up.    Existing MPF scheme members were given the option to:

- (a) remain in the MPF scheme; or
- (b) become members of the ROR scheme.

Employees choosing option (b) to enrol in the ROR scheme would have their current employment contracts with Employer terminated and  immediately  entered  into  new  employment  contracts  with Employer  with  the  same  position,  same  duties  and  at  the  same salary.    They  would  retain  their  accrued  benefits  in  the  MPF scheme  and  authorize  Employer  to  maintain  all  their  accrued benefits in the MPF contribution accounts.

## Option (a)

There would be no tax implication as Employees remained members of the MPF scheme.

## Option (b)

Since Employees would continue to work for Employer in the same position  with  the  same  duties  and  same  salary,  there  was  no termination  of  service  with  Employer  for  the  purposes  of  salaries tax.    The full amount of accrued benefits taken to have received by Employees  as  attributable  to  contributions,  whether  mandatory  or voluntary, paid to the MPF scheme by Employer would be treated as assessable income under section 9(1)(ad).

## Restrictions where employer is not chargeable to profits tax

51. Where the accrued benefit withdrawn by an employee is attributable to  the  voluntary  contributions  paid  by  an  employer  who  is  not  chargeable  to profits  tax,  the  amount  of  the  accrued  benefit  attributable  to  the  employer's contribution to be excluded from the income of the employee shall not exceed an amount equal to 15% of the total remuneration of the employee in the period of  12  months  preceding  the  date  on  which  the  accrued  benefit  is  received multiplied by the employee's completed years of service with the employer, as reduced  by  so  much  of  the  accrued  benefit  received  by  the  employee  as  is attributable  to  the  mandatory  contribution  of  the  employer.    In  practice,  this restriction  under  section  8(8)  is  generally  applicable  to  cases  where  the employer is a charitable body or other non-commercial organization such as a university.      Example 12 below illustrates how the proportionate benefit rule and the restrictions under section 8(7) and (8) work together.

## Example 12

Employer  who  was  a  charitable  institution  operated  an  MPF scheme.    On  top  of  the  mandatory  contributions,  Employer  made voluntary  contributions  to  the  scheme  at  16%  of  the  employees' relevant  income.    Employee  who  earned  an  annual  income  of $100,000 withdrew  from the scheme  all his accrued benefits attributable to the Employer's contributions in the following circumstances:

- (a) On retirement, death, incapacity or terminal illness with 10 years of service

Accrued benefit attributable to Employer's mandatory contribution payable to Employee as advised by the scheme trustee ($50,000 is exempt under section 8(2)(cb).)

$50,000

Accrued benefit attributable to Employer's voluntary contribution payable to Employee as advised by the scheme trustee

$160,000

Amount exempted: 15% limit under section

8(7) and (8)

($100,000 × 15% × 10) - $50,000

$100,000

Taxable benefit

$160,000 - $100,000 (i.e. excess over 15% limit)

$60,000

## (b) On termination of service with 6 years of service

Accrued benefit attributable to Employer's mandatory contribution due to Employee as advised by the scheme trustee (cannot be received by Employee unless Employee departed from Hong Kong permanently at the same time)

$30,000

Accrued benefit attributable to Employer's voluntary contribution due to Employee as advised by the scheme trustee

$96,000

Exemption amount: 15% limit under section

8(7) and (8)

($100,000 × 15% × 6) - $30,000

$60,000

Exemption amount under proportionate benefit rule $96,000 × 72/120

$57,600

Taxable benefit taken to have been received $96,000 - $57,600 (*)

$38,400

(*) The deductible sum is the lesser of the two exemption amounts.

## (c) On termination of service with 8 years of service

Accrued benefit attributable to Employer's mandatory contribution due to Employee as advised by the scheme trustee (cannot be received by Employee unless Employee departed from Hong Kong permanently at the same time)

$40,000

Accrued benefit attributable to Employer's voluntary contribution due to Employee as advised by the scheme trustee

$128,000

Exemption amount: 15% limit under section 8(7) and (8) ($100,000 × 15% × 8) - $40,000

$80,000

Exemption amount under proportionate benefit rule $128,000 × 96/120

$102,400

Taxable benefit taken to have been received $128,000 - $80,000 (**)

$48,000

(**) The deductible sum is the lesser of the two exemption amounts.

52. It  should  be  pointed  out  that  the  Department  may,  in  exceptional cases,  apply  the  restriction  to  cases  where  the  employer,  though  carrying  on business, is not chargeable to profits tax (for example, because its profits are wholly derived outside Hong Kong) if it is found that advantage is being taken of  the  tax  status  of  the  employer  to  reduce  the  employee's  salaries  tax liabilities.

## DEDUCTION ALLOWED TO EMPLOYEES UNDER SALARIES TAX AND PERSONAL ASSESSMENT

## Maximum amount of deduction

53. Section 26G of the IRO applies in relation to the year of assessment commencing  on  1  April  2000  and  to  all  subsequent  years  of  assessment. Under  section  26G,  contribution  made  by  an  employee  to  a  recognized retirement  scheme  is  an  allowable  deduction  under  salaries  tax  and  personal assessment.    Recognized retirement schemes include both ROR schemes and MPF schemes.    The amount of deduction is, however, limited to that specified in  Schedule  3B  to  the  IRO  which  is  equivalent  to  the  maximum  amount  of mandatory  contributions  payable  in  accordance  with  the  MPFSO.    The maximum amount specified in Schedule 3B is as follows:
54. A person taking up more than one employment may be required to make  contributions  to  more  than  one  scheme.    He  can  claim  deduction  of mandatory  contributions  paid  on  all  schemes,  with  the  aggregate  deductions claimed  not  exceeding  the  maximum  amount.    Any  sum  allowable  as  a deduction under Part 4 (Profits Tax) of the IRO cannot be deducted again under section  26G.    In  other  words,  contributions  made  by  self-employed  persons and claimed as allowable deduction for profits tax purposes cannot be claimed as a deduction under section 26G.
55. In the case of contributions made by a person to an ROR scheme, the amount allowed for deduction is the lesser of the actual amount contributed or  the  amount  of  mandatory  contribution  that  the  person  would  have  been required to pay as an employee had that scheme been an MPF scheme.    The total  deduction  allowable  to  a  person  for  a  year  of  assessment  under  section 26G cannot exceed the amount specified in Schedule 3B.

| Year(s) of assessment   | Maximum amount of deduction   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 2000/01 to 2011/12      | $12,000                       |
| 2012/13                 | $14,500                       |
| 2013/14                 | $15,000                       |
| 2014/15                 | $17,500                       |
| 2015/16 and thereafter  | $18,000                       |

## DEDUCTION ALLOWED TO EMPLOYERS UNDER PROFITS TAX

## Contributions made by employers

56. A special contribution, as distinct from an ordinary annual contribution in the case of an ROR scheme or a regular contribution in an MPF scheme, or a premium, other than an ordinary annual premium in respect of a contract of insurance under an ROR scheme, will be allowed as a deduction but to the extent that it is made in respect of individuals employed for the purposes of producing profits chargeable to profits tax and that it is not excessive in view of all the relevant circumstances.    The deduction will be allowed under section 16A(2)  at  an  even  rate  over  the  basis  period  of  each  of  the  five  years  of assessment commencing from that year during whose basis period the special contribution was actually made.
57. For this purpose, contributions made to an MPF scheme at regular intervals of similar or substantially similar amounts or of amounts calculated by reference  to  a  scale  or  a  fixed  percentage  of  a  person's  salary  or  other remuneration are treated under section 16A(3) as regular contributions.
58. Ordinary annual contributions to or ordinary annual premiums for a contract of insurance under an ROR  scheme or regular contributions (mandatory or voluntary or both) to an MPF scheme by an employer for the benefit  of  his  employees  are  in  general  outgoings  or  expenses  allowable  for deduction  under  section  16(1)  to  the  extent  that  they  are  incurred  in  the production of profits in respect of which the employer is chargeable to profits tax.    The deduction is, however, limited under section 17(1)(h) to 15% of the total emoluments of the employee for the period to which the payments relate. For this purpose, the term 'total emoluments' refers to total taxable emoluments of an employee from the employment or office and includes  all allowances and benefits in kind, such as housing benefits.    Provision made for the  payment  of  contribution  or  premium  referred  to  in  section  17(1)(h)  in excess of the 15% limit will also not be deductible under section 17(1)(i).
59. Any provision made other than for the payment of contribution or premium referred to in section 17(1)(h) is not deductible under section 17(1)(j).

60. Where a provision  for  the  payment  of  any  contributions  has  been allowed in a prior year, the payment subsequently made is not deductible under section 17(1)(k).
61. Any  provision  made  for  payment  or  contribution  to  retirement schemes,  which  are  not  ROR  schemes,  will  not  be  deductible  under  section 17(1)(j) and (l).
62. Accounting  for  retirement  schemes  is  governed  by  Hong  Kong Accounting  Standard  19 Employee  Benefits (HKAS  19)  issued  by  the  Hong Kong  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants.    For  defined  contribution schemes,  the  accounting  and  taxation  treatments  for  the  contributions  are normally  straightforward.    Ordinary  annual  contributions  or  premiums  and regular contributions paid and payable for a period will be charged as expenses in the profit and loss account of the period concerned and allowed for taxation purposes, subject to the 15% limit.
63. Accounting  for  defined  benefit  schemes  is  much  more  complex. Under such a scheme, the employer is responsible for the ultimate payments of scheme benefits to employees as promised, which are usually determined by to reference employees' earnings and years of service.    The employer has to bear the actuarial  risk  (that  benefits  will  cost  more  than  expected)  and  investment  risk  of scheme assets.    Thus, the cost to the employer of providing the promised retirement benefits cannot be measured by the amounts of contributions currently due alone.
64. HKAS  19  requires  that  an  employer  participating  in  a  defined benefit scheme shall recognize the changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset), instead of actual contributions paid, in the accounts.    The components of defined benefit cost would be made up of the following:
6. (a) service cost (including past service cost and settlement);
7. (b) net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) 4 ; and
8. (c) remeasurements  of  the  net  defined  benefit  liability  (asset), including actuarial gains and losses recognized in accordance with HKAS 19.

4 Interest cost and the expected return on scheme assets are replaced with a measure of net interest on the defined benefit asset or liability in HKAS 19 (2011) issued in July 2011.

As such, the expense recognized for a defined benefit scheme is not necessarily the amount of the contribution due for the period.

65. Having sought legal advice, it was agreed that the defined benefit cost  charged  in  the  accounts  as  required  by  HKAS  19  is  not  a  provision  for payment of ordinary annual contributions to the defined benefit scheme.    The defined benefit cost is recognized for accounting purposes as a provision for liabilities incurred when the employer consumes the economic benefit arising from service provided by an employee in exchange for employee benefits.
66. Under  section  17(1)(j),  the  defined  benefit  cost  (including  the actuarial gains and losses) recognized in the income statement as required by HKAS 19 is  not  deductible.    Where  the  component  is  a  credit,  the  amount credited is not taxable as a write-back of over-provision or as a deemed receipt by virtue of section 15(1)(h).
67. As such,  the  assessing  practice  for  defined  benefit  schemes  is  the same  as  that  for  defined  contribution  schemes  (i.e.  the  ordinary  annual contributions paid are allowable for deduction, subject to the 15% limit).
68. Retirement  schemes  established  under  ORSO  have  separate  legal identities  from those of their sponsoring employers.    Any losses incurred on the disposal of investments held by ORSO schemes at the time when they are liquidated  are  not  deductible  in  determining  the  assessable  profits  of  the employers who established the schemes.
69. On the other hand, costs incurred by an employer in establishing an MPF scheme, amending the rules of an ORSO scheme to comply with the MPF regulations  or  winding  up  an  ORSO  scheme  will  ordinarily  be  deductible. Such expenses are regarded as effecting a change on the basis that a business remunerates its employees and not a change in the structure of the business.

## ASSESSABILITY OF SUMS RECEIVED BY EMPLOYERS

## Refund of contributions to employers

70. Section 15(1)(h) of the IRO deems sums received by or accrued to a person  as  an  employer,  by  way  of  refunds  of  contributions  made  to  an  ROR

scheme  or  of  voluntary  contributions  paid  to  an  MPF  scheme,  to  the  extent deduction has been allowed in ascertaining his assessable profits, to be taxable. Employer's  contributions  to  an  ORSO  scheme  repaid  to  the  employer  upon winding  up  of  the scheme  are  taxable on  the  employer.    Any  excess recoupment (being investment income of the ORSO scheme) is not taxable in the hands of the employer.

## Offsetting of severance and long service payments

71. Under  the  Employment  Ordinance,  an  employer  can  offset  the amount of severance payment or long service payment payable to an employee out of the MPF scheme's accrued benefits derived from the contributions made by the employer for the employee.    If the contributions made by the employer exceed the amount of severance/long service payment, the remaining balance has to be retained in the employee's account of the scheme.    On the other hand, if the contributions made by the employer cannot fully offset the severance or long service payment, the employer must pay the outstanding balance.
72. Where  an  employer  has  paid  to  an  employee  severance  or  long service payment, he may, by virtue of section 12A(1) and (2) of the MPFSO, require  the  approved  trustee  of  the  MPF  scheme  to  pay  to  him  an  amount representing  the  employee's  accrued  benefit  attributable  to  the  employer's contributions  not  exceeding  the  amount  of  the  severance  or  long  service payment he paid to the employee.    Such a payment to the employer is a refund of the contributions he previously made to the MPF scheme as a result of the reduction of the benefit of the employee as stipulated under section 31IA of the Employment Ordinance.    The portion of the refund which is attributable to the voluntary  contributions  made  by  the  employer  is  chargeable  to  tax  under section 15(1)(h)(ii) to the extent that it is previously allowed as a deduction in ascertaining  the  employer's  assessable  profits.    The  portion  of  the  refund, which is attributable to the mandatory contributions to the extent that deduction has previously been allowed, should be set-off against the severance payment or long service payment claimed as an allowable deduction.

## EXEMPTIONS GIVEN TO RETIREMENT SCHEMES

## Recognized retirement schemes

73. Recognized retirement schemes authorized as collective investment schemes by the  Securities  and  Futures  Commission  under  section  104  of  the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571) are exempt from profits tax under section 26A(1A)(a) of the IRO.

## Non-resident retirement schemes

74. Prior to 1 April 2019, non-resident retirement schemes were exempt from profits tax if the conditions in section 20AC were satisfied:
2. (a) the non-resident retirement scheme did not carry on any trade, profession  or  business  in  Hong  Kong  involving  transactions other than the specified transactions and transactions incidental to the carrying out of the specified transaction; and
3. (b) the specified transactions were carried out through or arranged by a specified person, or the non-resident retirement scheme was a qualifying fund.

On and after 1 April 2019, non-resident retirement schemes, not falling within the meaning of 'fund' in section 20AM, can continue to obtain tax exemption under section 20AC in respect of profits derived from the specified transactions and incidental transactions.

## Retirement schemes which are funds

75. After the enactment of Inland Revenue (Profits Tax Exemption for Funds) (Amendment) Ordinance 2019, effective from 1 April 2019, retirement schemes, which are not exempted under section 26A(1)(a) but falling within the meaning of 'fund' in section 20AM, can obtain profits tax exemption subject to meeting conditions set out in section 20AN in respect of profits derived from transactions  in  assets  of  a  class  specified  in  Schedule  16C  and  incidental transactions.    It should be noted that section 20AM(5)(c) specifically excludes an  arrangement  in  which  all  participating  persons are  employees  or  former

employees of a corporation (or their spouse or children) who are in the same group of the companies as the operator of the arrangement.

## DEDUCTION ALLOWED TO SELF-EMPLOYED PERSONS

## Mandatory contributions

76. A self-employed person who is either a sole proprietor or a partner of  a  partnership  is  also  required  to  join  an  MPF  scheme.    Under  section 16AA(1), any mandatory contributions paid in the basis period for a  year  of assessment are deemed to be expenses wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of profits chargeable to tax of that trade, profession or business and shall be allowed as a deduction in ascertaining the person's assessable profits. However,  under  section  16AA(2),  such  deductions  cannot  exceed  the  limit specified in Schedule 3B as reduced by any sum allowable under section 26G of  the  IRO.    Provisions  in  this  section  override  those  in  section  17(1)(a)(ii) which  is  applicable  to  a  sole  proprietor  and  section  17(2)(d)(iii)  which  is applicable  to  a  partner  and  a  partner's  spouse.    Any  sum  allowable  as  a deduction under profits tax will not be allowable for deduction under section 26G .

## Voluntary contributions

77. Voluntary  contributions  and  TVC  made  to  an  MPF  scheme  by self-employed persons are not deductible under section 17(1)(a)(ii) and (2)(d)(iii) as they are expenditure of a private nature and are not incurred in the production of profits chargeable to tax.    Likewise, any contributions made to an  MPF scheme by a sole proprietor  in  respect  of  his  or  her  spouse  or  by  a partnership  in  respect  of  a  partner's  spouse  are  not  allowable  under  section 17(2)(c) and (d)(iii) respectively.    As regards TVC made by a self-employed person  on  and  after  1  April  2019,  the  concessionary  deduction  for  such contribution would be allowable under section 26S if the self-employed person elects for personal assessment.

## Refund of contributions

78. The provisions  in  section  15(1)(h)  of  the  IRO,  which  concern  the assessability of refund of contributions, also apply to self-employed persons.

## ESTATE DUTY

## Exemption provisions

79. Section 10(h) of the Estate Duty Ordinance (Cap. 111) provides that no estate duty will be payable in respect of accrued benefit passing on the death of  a  deceased  member  of  an  ORSO  scheme.    Similar  exemption  provisions have been enacted as section 10(i) in respect of accrued benefit of a deceased member of MPF scheme registered under the MPFSO that are  to  be  paid  in accordance  with  section  15(4)  of  the  MPFSO.    With  the  abolition  of  estate duty  with  effect  from  11  February  2006,  accrued  benefit  of  a  deceased  who passes away on or after that day will have no estate duty implication at all.

## REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY OF EMPLOYERS

## Employer's return

80. It remains the employer's responsibility to report to the Commissioner by way of Employer's Return, among other things, the amount of  an  employee's  gross  income  from  employment  (i.e.  before  deducting  any contributions made to a recognized retirement scheme) as well as the taxable amount,  if  any,  of  benefits  received  or  taken  to  have  been  received  by  the employee from the scheme.
81. Employers must record and retain, for each employee who migrates from an ORSO scheme to an MPF scheme or from one MPF scheme to another, the details of the employer's contributions included in the voluntary contributions transferred. Where accrued benefits attributable to the employer's contributions are received or taken to have been received (otherwise than on the ground of retirement, death, incapacity, terminal illness or  termination  of  service,  whether  in  a  lump  sum  or  (if  applicable)  as  an instalment), employers have an obligation to report the taxable amount received by the employee in the Employer's Return for that year.

## DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENTS

## Pensions article

82. In  negotiation  of  a  double  taxation  agreement  (DTA), Hong Kong generally seeks to obtain exclusive taxation right over payments made out of an MPF  scheme.    This  is  achieved  if  pensions  and  other  similar  remuneration (including a lump sum payment) made under a pension or retirement scheme, in which individuals may participate to secure retirement benefits and which is recognized  for  tax  purposes  in  Hong  Kong,  are  taxable  only  in  Hong  Kong. The same result can also be achieved if pensions and other similar remuneration (including a lump sum payment) arising in Hong Kong and paid to  an  individual  in  consideration  of  past  employment  or  self-employment  is taxable  only  in  Hong  Kong.    However,  if  the  taxing  right  over  pensions  is shared under a DTA, Hong Kong's tax treaty partner would also have the right to tax the pensions though arising in Hong Kong.

## Meaning and situs of pension

83. The  word  'pension'  in  the  Pensions  Article  of  a  DTA  covers  a periodic  pension  and  a  lump  sum  pension.    To  avoid  doubt,  a  lump  sum payment  is  explicitly  included.    Thus,  accrued  benefits  withdrawn  under  a recognized retirement scheme, whether by way of a lump sum or instalments, are  generally  not  expected  to  be  taxed  by  Hong  Kong's  DTA  partner.    The source of a pension (i.e. whether a pension is arising in Hong Kong) is the situs of the fund from which the pension is paid.    This does not necessarily mean the place where the assets comprising the fund are physically situated but the place where the fund is managed and controlled.
