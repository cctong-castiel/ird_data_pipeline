## INTRODUCTION

## Digital economy and electronic commerce

Digital transformation of the economy continues to evolve at a rapid pace and has altered the electronic commerce (e-commerce) landscape as follows:

- (a) cross-jurisdictional scale without mass (i.e. goods or services are  supplied  in  a  jurisdiction  without  having  any  physical presence there);
- (b) heavy reliance of intangible assets; and
- (c) importance of data, user participation and their synergies with intellectual property.
2. The tax challenges of the digitalisation of the economy were identified as  the  main  focus  under Action 1 of the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting  (BEPS)  Project.    Two  reports Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy, Action 1 - 2015 Final Report and Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation -Interim Report 2018 were issued in October 2015 and March 2018  respectively. Members  of  the  Inclusive  Framework  on  BEPS  after identifying the issues have committed to work on a consensus-based and longterm solution to the tax challenges of the digitalisation of the economy and the final report would be delivered by the end of 2020 1 .

## Changing international rules

3. This revised Practice Note sets out the taxation principles that broadly apply to e-commerce  transactions and digital assets. Given  that  new international  tax  rules  would  be  introduced  in  2020,  it  is  expected  that  this Practice Note would require further updating.

1 Digitalisation of the economy raised a number of broader direct tax challenges chiefly relating to the question of how taxing rights on income generated from cross-border activities in the digital economy should be allocated among jurisdictions.    It was also observed that the challenges included remaining BEPS risks that profits can still be shifted to no or very low tax jurisdictions.

## E-COMMERCE MODELS

## Transactions through networks

4. E-commerce  models focus on conducting transactions through networks such as the internet.    Products are sold online through the use of a range  of  digital  technologies,  including  artificial  intelligence,  blockchain,  the Internet of Things and autonomous delivery devices, to facilitate e-commerce while payment services like mobile money and digital wallets widen the scope of e-commerce.

## Specific methods for sale or purchase

5. In e-commerce, the sale or purchase of goods or services is conducted over computer networks by methods specifically designed for the purpose of placing or receiving of orders.    The goods or services may be ordered by those specifically designed methods though the payment and the ultimate delivery of the goods or services do not have to be conducted online.    In other words, an ecommerce transaction can be a pure online transaction (i.e. order and delivery of services are completed electronically) or a partially online transaction (i.e. order of  goods  electronically  and  delivery  through  conventional  channels).    The following are some of the methods:
2. (a) Online  platforms  match  buyers  and  sellers,  including  across borders,  to  facilitate  online  transactions.    These  platforms enable more and different products to be sold, but often require mechanisms that match buyers and sellers, boost trust among unknown e-commerce participants, and encourage more firms to enter the marketplace.
3. (b) Subscription  service  business  models  (e.g.  music  streaming) enable the continuous  provision of products  in exchange for recurring payments.
4. (c) Omni-channel models use offline or physical features to sell online (e.g. automated supermarkets to skip-the-queue mobile application ordering) that enable e-commerce while removing the frictions associated with offline ordering.

## Value creation

6. In  e-commerce,  the  value  creation  process  generally  displays  the following important characteristics:
2. (a) Increased importance of data: data generated and gathered in the  course  of  an  e-commerce  transaction  (e.g.  customers' personal data and their purchase and browsing histories) enable product  offerings,  improve  matching  and  create  a  better consumer experience.
3. (b) Intense use of intellectual property assets: algorithms, big data analytics and artificial intelligence are used for analysing data collected from customers to personalise matching and product recommendations.
4. (c) Network  effects:  direct network  effects are created if a significant number of end-users are attracted to consume the same good or service.    Indirect network effects, in the context of multi-sided markets, are created since a specific group of end-users can interact with another group of end-users via an online platform.
5. (d) Transformation of back-end operations: online retailers make use  of  technological  applications  on  inventory,  warehousing and logistics processes to increase efficiency.

These characteristics, which explain the way value is created in e-commerce, may not all be found in each e-commerce model.

## Core operations and support activities

7. In each e-commerce model, the operations or activities may differ but the following core operations may be found:

Core operations - value network

- (a) Network promotion and contract management associated with

inviting potential users to join the network, selection of users that are allowed to join and the initialisation, management, and termination  of  contracts  governing  service  provisioning  and charging.

- (b) Service provisioning associated with establishing, maintaining, and terminating links between customers and billing for value received. The  links  can  be  synchronous  as  in  telephone service  or  asynchronous  as  in  e-mail  service  or  banking. Billing  may  require  measuring  individuals'  use  of  network capacity in volume or time (e.g. telephone calls billed by the minute, data usage by volume).
- (c) Network infrastructure operation associated with maintaining and running a physical and information infrastructure.

Core operations - value shop

- (d) Problem-finding  and  acquisition  associated  with  recording, reviewing and formulating a problem to be solved.
- (e) Problem-solving  associated  with  generating  and  evaluating alternative solutions.
- (f) Choice associated with choosing among alternative solutions to the  problem.    Choice  is  an  activity  category  that  in  most contexts is of limited importance in terms of effort and time but is important from the point of view of value.
- (g) Execution  associated  with  communicating,  organising,  and implementing the chosen solution.
- (h) Control and evaluation associated with measuring and evaluating the extent to which implementation has solved the initial problem.

While not all the above core operations are found in each e-commerce model, they are generally sustained by the same kinds of support activities:

## Support activities

- (i) Procurement associated with the function of purchasing inputs used in the firm's value chain.    Purchased inputs include raw materials, supplies and other consumable items as well as assets such as machinery, laboratory equipment, office equipment and buildings.
- (j) Human resource management associated with recruiting, hiring, training, human capital development and compensation of all types of personnel.
- (k) Technology  development  broadly  grouped  into  efforts  to improve  the  product  and  process,  from  basic  research  and product design to media research.
- (l) Firm  infrastructure  activities  including  general  management, planning,  finance,  accounting,  legal,  government  affairs  and quality management.

The question how a person engaged in e-commerce carries out each of the core operations  or  support  activities  is  largely  based  on  the  nature  of  goods  and services.    Strictly, whether an operation or activity should be regarded as core or support is a question of fact and circumstances.

## CHARGE OF PROFITS TAX

## Charging provisions

8. Currently,  the  Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  (the  Ordinance)  does  not contain any specific provisions that deal with the taxation of e-commerce.    The tax consequences of e-commerce transactions are to be determined by reference to the profits tax provisions of the Ordinance which apply to a person carrying on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong.
9. Section 14 provides that profits tax shall be charged on every person carrying  on  a  trade,  profession  or  business  in  Hong  Kong  in  respect  of  his

assessable  profits  arising  in  or  derived  from  Hong  Kong  from  such  trade, profession or business.    Before a charge to tax can arise under section 14, three conditions must be satisfied:

- (a) the person must carry on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong;
- (b) the profits to be charged must be from such trade, profession or business carried on by the person in Hong Kong; and
- (c) the profits must be 'profits arising in or derived from' Hong Kong.

## CARRYING ON BUSINESS IN HONG KONG

## Carrying on an e-commerce business

10. The question whether certain operations or activities amount to the carrying  on  of  a  trade  or  business  is  a  question  of  fact  and  degree  upon  a consideration of all the circumstances.    Although it is not essential for a person carrying on a trade or business to have an office, staff or organisation, where none of these attributes exists, there must be other clear evidence of carrying on a trade or business.
11. Extensive activities are not necessarily required before it can be said that a person is carrying on a trade or business.    In the Privy Council case of American  Leaf  Blending  Co  Sdn  Bhd  v  Director-General  of  Inland  Revenue [1979] AC 676, Lord Diplock said at page 684:
3. ' … in the case of a company incorporated for the purpose of making profits for its shareholders any gainful use to which it puts any of its assets prima facie amounts to the carrying on of a business.'

The principles were applied in CIR v Bartica Investment Ltd [1996] 4 HKC 599. While the presumption referred to in Lord Diplock's statement is an important one, each case has to be decided on its own facts.    The Commissioner accepts that not every gainful use of a company's assets would necessarily lead to the conclusion that a trade or business is being carried on.

12. Though e-commerce may be transacted in many different ways and may  involve  a  very  wide  range  of  goods  and  services,  the  business  process displays many similar characteristics relating to value creation.    If the business core operations or support activities are performed in Hong Kong, it should be clear that the person is carrying on an e-commerce business in Hong Kong.    The operations or activities, performed by either the person or the person's agents, should be examined in the context of e-commerce and the relevant e-commerce model  since  an  e-commerce  business  may  require  significantly  less  physical operations,  personnel  and  facilities  in  a  particular  location  compared  with  a person engaged in a traditional business.

## Permanent establishment in Hong Kong deemed carrying on business

13. Section 50AAK(1) provides that a non-Hong Kong resident person is regarded as carrying on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong for the purposes of charging profits tax if the non-Hong Kong resident person has a permanent  establishment  in  Hong  Kong.    However,  if  a  non-Hong  Kong resident person does not have a permanent establishment in Hong Kong, it does not necessarily follow that the non-Hong Kong resident person is not carrying on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong.    In such cases, whether the non-Hong Kong resident person is carrying on a business in Hong Kong would depend on the facts and circumstances.

## LOCALITY OF PROFITS

## Broad guiding principles

14. The Ordinance does not contain a comprehensive set of source rules. To determine the source of particular profits, guidance is often obtained from judicial  precedents. In  this  regard,  the  courts  have  often  stated  that  the determination of source is a practical, hard  matter of fact.    Furthermore,  the courts have tended to emphasise certain factors as being relevant in determining the source of particular types of income.    In Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 21, on the locality of profits, some of the particular factors are  illustrated  on  a  broad  principle  basis. That  Practice  Note  is  equally applicable in deciding the locality of profits where e-commerce is involved.    In general terms, however, it must be stressed that the proper approach to be taken

in  determining  the  locality  of  profits  is  to  ascertain  what  were  the  person's operations which produced the relevant profits and where those operations took place.

15. In relation to the locality of profits, it is relevant to mention that in CIR v HK-TVB International Limited [1992] 2 AC 397, Lord Jauncey stated, at page 409:
2. ' … it can only be in rare cases that a taxpayer with a principal place of business in Hong Kong can earn profits which are not chargeable to profits tax under section 14 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance.'

In CIR v Magna Industrial Co Ltd [1997] 1 HKLRD 173, the Court of Appeal also referred to the same statement and stated, at page 179, that '[a]s a matter of common-sense, this must be so.'.    Whether a case contains exceptional features which put it into the 'rare case' category depends on all the facts of the case.

## Antecedent or incidental activities

16. In ING Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd v CIR (2007) 10 HKCFAR 417 , Riberio PJ when discussing the legal principle emphasised the need to grasp the reality of each case, focusing on effective causes without being distracted by antecedent or incidental matters.    The focus is on establishing the geographical location of the person's profit-producing transactions as distinct from activities antecedent or incidental to those transactions.    Whether an act is an antecedent or incidental activity is a question of fact and would depend on the nature of the transaction.

## Importance of server

17. In the context  of  e-commerce,  operations  are  automated  to  a significant extent, with the consequence that physical activities are comparatively  reduced.    A  server  may  be  used  to  provide  a  communication linkage between contracting parties for a variety of purposes:
2. (a) to give information about products and services;
3. (b) to process online purchase orders;

- (c) to deliver digitised products or services electronically; or
- (d) to process payments.

Though these operations may be automated and carried out using a server located outside Hong Kong, this fact does not, of itself, lead to the conclusion that the source of profits is located outside Hong Kong.    These operations have to be weighed  against the core operations required to effect  the  e-commerce transactions,  which  may  be  carried  out  within  a  physical  office,  including operations arising from the need to automate, manage and control the virtual shop-front or back-office.    Irrespective of the e-commerce model adopted, it is usually the case that tasks undertaken through a server are performed according to pre-designed application software since the server cannot function by itself and human functions remain important in the carrying on of the e-commerce business  as  a  whole.    The  Commissioner  therefore  takes  the  view  that  the location of the server alone does not determine the locality of the profits, and the proper approach is to focus more on the core operations that have effected the ecommerce transaction to earn the profits in question and the place where those operations have been carried out, rather than on what  has been  done electronically.

18. Decided cases suggest that in ascertaining the locality of a person's profits, it may be necessary to have regard to what the person's agent has done. The term 'agent' can refer to either a natural person or a legal person, but does not  include  software  or  a  server,  no  matter  how  advanced  it  is.    Nor  can  an internet service provider who merely operates a server under a website hosting arrangement be regarded as an agent for this purpose.
19. In  cases  where  a  server  is  used  in  the  derivation  of  profits,  the Commissioner would not merely have regard to the place where the server is located  in  determining  the  locality  of  e-commerce  profits. By  way  of illustration:
3. (a) If  a  person,  resident  in  Hong  Kong,  performs  all  the  core operations and support activities of an e-commerce business in Hong  Kong  apart  from  operating  a  server,  intelligent  or otherwise, which is at the person's disposal and located outside Hong  Kong  for  e-commerce  purposes,  the  profits  from  the

person's  e-commerce  transactions  will  be  fully  charged  to profits tax as profits derived from Hong Kong.    Foreign tax, if any, charged  on  the  profits  attributable to the server permanent establishment in a DTA territory (i.e. a territory with which Hong Kong has made a double taxation agreement or arrangement  (DTA))  would  be  allowed  as  a  credit  against profits tax payable.

- (b) If a person, resident in a DTA territory, performs most of the operations  and  support  activities  of  an  e-commerce  business outside Hong Kong apart from operating merely a server with essential  and  significant  activities  which  is  at  the  person's disposal and located in Hong Kong (i.e. the server constitutes a permanent establishment in Hong Kong), profits attributable to the  server  permanent  establishment  having  regard  to  the functions the server performs in Hong Kong will be charged to profits tax in accordance with the general principles in section 14. Relief  from  double  taxation  would  be  provided  in  the DTA territory by way of exemption or tax credit if the profits attributable  to  the  server  permanent  establishment  in  Hong Kong are also taxable in the DTA territory.

## Non-automated operations

20. In  e-commerce  transactions,  it  is  necessary  to  look  into  the  ecommerce model, the operations which produced the profits (i.e. core operations) and the place where those operations took place in order to ascertain whether the profits from the transactions are sourced in Hong Kong.    The place where the following  non-automated  operations,  whether  carried  out  by  a  traditional business or an e-commerce business, should be relevant for deciding the source of profits:
2. (a) Inbound logistics associated with receiving, storing and disseminating  inputs  to  the  product  (e.g.  material  handling, warehousing,  inventory  control,  and  vehicle  schedule  and returns to suppliers).

- (b) Operations associated with transforming inputs into the final product form (e.g. machining, packaging, assembly, equipment maintenance, testing, printing, and facility operations).
- (c) Outbound  logistics  associated  with  collecting,  storing  and physically  distributing  the  product  to  buyers  (e.g.  finished goods warehousing, material handling, delivery vehicle operation, and order processing and scheduling).
- (d) Marketing  and  sales  associated  with  providing  a  means  by which buyers can purchase the product and inducing them to do so (e.g. advertising, promotion, sales force, quoting, channel selection, channel relations and pricing).
- (e) Service  associated  with  providing  service  to  enhance  or maintain  the  value  of  the  product  (e.g.  installation,  repair, training, parts supply and product adjustment).

## Example 1

Corporation-HK, resident  in  Hong  Kong,  carried  on  a  business  of selling  books  in  Hong  Kong.    It  operated  a  server  at  its  disposal located in a DTA territory and hosted its website on that server.    The functions of the server on which the website was hosted were to enable customers in Hong Kong and overseas to obtain details of the books and price information, order the books, make payments for purchase online  and  download  the  e-books. Apart  from  these  functions performed by the server, all business operations of Corporation-HK, including the procurement of books, the supply of information for the website, the storage of books, the answering of customers' enquiries, the receipt of payments for purchase and the provision of after-sale services, were carried out in Hong Kong.

Although  the  server  on  which  the  website  was  hosted  was  located outside Hong Kong, the fulfillment of the business obligations was done largely through Corporation-HK's core operations in Hong Kong. The profits  made by  Corporation-HK from selling books would be chargeable to profits tax. Foreign  tax charged  on  the  profits

attributable to the server, if constituting a permanent establishment in the DTA territory, would be allowed as a credit against profits tax payable.

## Example 2

Corporation-HK, resident  in  Hong  Kong,  carried  on  a  business  of providing  consultancy  services  in  Hong  Kong.    Corporation-HK operated a server at its disposal located in a non-DTA territory and hosted  its  website  on  that  server.    The  functions  of  the  server  on which the website was hosted were to supply details of its services, answer  enquiries,  enable  communications  with  its  clients/potential clients  to  be  made  electronically,  and  accept  payments for services rendered. Corporation-HK  obtained  consultancy  projects  from overseas  clients  through  the  server. The  work  relating  to  the consultancy services, including collecting and analysing data, undertaking research and preparing reports, was conducted in Hong Kong.    The  final  reports  for  the  projects  were  either  sent  to  the overseas  clients  through  e-mail  or  uploaded  to  the  server  for downloading by the clients.

The server  on  which  the  website  was  hosted  merely  facilitated  the provision of the e-service.    Although the server was located outside Hong  Kong,  the  fulfillment  of  the  business  obligations  and  the operations which in substance gave rise to the profits were carried out in  Hong  Kong.    The  profits  derived  by  Corporation-HK  from  the provision of consultancy services would be chargeable to profits tax. Foreign  tax  charged  on  the  profits  attributable  to  the  server,  if constituting  a  permanent  establishment  in  the  non-DTA  territory, would not be allowed as a credit against profits tax payable.

## PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT

## Permanent establishment in Hong Kong

21. If a non-Hong Kong resident person is a DTA territory resident person, the  question  whether  the  non-Hong  Kong  resident  person  has  a  permanent establishment  in  Hong  Kong  is  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the

permanent establishment article of the relevant DTA.    If the non-Hong Kong resident  person  is  a  non-DTA  territory  resident  person,  the  question  is  to  be determined in accordance with Part 3 of Schedule 17G.

22. The  definition  of  permanent  establishment  provided  in  Part  3  of Schedule  17G  is  consistent  with  the  permanent  establishment  article  of  the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (MTC), as approved on 21 November 2017, on which the DTAs of Hong Kong are modelled.    In essence,  an  enterprise  which  is  a  non-DTA  territory  resident  person  has  a permanent establishment in Hong Kong if it has a fixed place of business in Hong Kong through which the business of the enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. For  more  details  on  the  meaning  of  permanent  establishment,  please  refer  to Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 60.

## Activities of preparatory or auxiliary character

23. In accordance with the permanent establishment article of the MTC and  Part  3  of  Schedule  17G,  an  enterprise,  even  if  having  a  fixed  place  of business  in  Hong  Kong  through  which  its  business  is  carried  on,  will  not  be regarded as having a permanent establishment in Hong Kong if the activities carried on by it are merely preparatory or auxiliary.
24. Generally, an activity is of a preparatory character if it is carried on in contemplation of the carrying on of what constitutes the essential and significant part of the activity of the enterprise as a whole.    Since a preparatory activity precedes another activity, it  will  often  be  carried  on  during  a  relatively  short period of time, the duration of that period being determined by the nature of the core operations of the enterprise.    An activity is of an auxiliary character if it corresponds  to  an  activity  that  is  carried  on  to  support  the  essential  and significant part of the activity of the enterprise as a whole.    It is unlikely that an activity that requires a significant proportion of the assets or employees of the enterprise could be considered as having an auxiliary character.
25. What constitutes core operations for a particular enterprise have to be determined in the light of the business of the enterprise as a whole. In  the  context  of  e-commerce,  the  decisive  criterion  may  be:  whether  the activities of the fixed place of business form an essential and significant part of the e-commerce business as a whole; or whether the operations of the enterprise

carried on through the place in relation to such business go beyond preparatory or  auxiliary  activities.    An  activity  considered  to  be  merely  preparatory  or auxiliary in nature for a traditional business may amount to a core operation of an e-commerce business.    The fixed place of business would not be regarded as a  permanent  establishment  only  if  the  overall  activity  of  the  place  is  of  a preparatory or auxiliary character.

## Example 3

Corporation-F,  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F,  sold  books  online  to customers in Hong Kong.    Corporation-F maintained in Hong Kong a very large warehouse in which a significant number of employees worked for the main purpose of storing and delivering books owned by Corporation-F.

The storage and delivery activities that were performed through the warehouse in Hong Kong, which represented an important asset and required a number of employees, constituted an essential part of the sale  and  distribution  business  of  Corporation-F. Therefore,  the storage  and  delivery  activities  in  Hong  Kong  did  not  have  a preparatory or auxiliary character.    Corporation-F would be regarded as having a permanent establishment in Hong Kong.

## Computer equipment that constitutes a permanent establishment

26. Paragraphs  122  to 131  of  the  commentary  on  the  permanent establishment article of the MTC relate to e-commerce and explain as follows:
2. '123.  … an Internet web site, which is a combination of software and electronic data, does not in itself constitute tangible property. It therefore does not have a location that can constitute a 'place of business' as there is no 'facility such as premises or, in certain instances, machinery or equipment' … as far as the software and data constituting that web site is concerned.    On the other hand, the server on which the web site is stored and through which it is accessible is a piece of equipment having a physical location and such location may thus constitute a 'fixed place of business' of the enterprise that operates that server.

124.    The distinction between a web site and the server on which the web site is stored and used is important since the enterprise that operates  the  server  may  be  different  from  the  enterprise  that carries  on  business  through  the  web  site.    For  example,  it  is common for the web site through which an enterprise carries on its  business  to  be  hosted  on  the  server  of  an  Internet  Service Provider (ISP).    Although the fees paid to the ISP under such arrangements may be based on the amount of disk space used to store  the  software  and  data  required  by  the  web  site,  these contracts  typically  do  not  result  in  the  server  and  its  location being at the disposal of the enterprise … even if the enterprise has been able to determine that its web site should be hosted on a particular server at a particular location.    In such a case, the enterprise does not even have a physical presence at that location since the web site is not tangible.    In these cases, the enterprise cannot be considered to have acquired a place of business by virtue of that hosting arrangement.    However, if the enterprise carrying on business through a web site has the server at its own disposal, for example it owns (or leases) and operates the server on which the web site is stored and used, the place where that server is located could constitute a permanent establishment of the enterprise if the other requirements of the Article are met.
125.    Computer equipment at a given location may only constitute a permanent establishment if it  meets  the  requirement  of  being fixed. In  the  case  of  a  server,  what  is  relevant  is  not  the possibility of the server being moved, but whether it is in fact moved.    In order to constitute a fixed place of business, a server will need to be located at a certain place for a sufficient period of time so as to become fixed …
126. Another issue is whether the business of an enterprise may be said to be wholly or partly carried on at a location where the enterprise has equipment such as a server at its disposal.    The question of whether the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on through such equipment needs to be examined on a case-by-case basis, having regard to whether it can be said that, because of such equipment, the enterprise has facilities at

its  disposal  where  business  functions  of  the  enterprise  are performed.

127. Where an enterprise operates computer equipment at a particular location, a permanent establishment may exist even though no personnel of that enterprise is required at that location for the operation of the equipment.    The presence of personnel is not necessary to consider that an enterprise wholly or partly carries on  its  business  at  a  location  when  no  personnel  are  in  fact required to carry on business activities at that location …
128. Another issue relates to the fact that no permanent establishment may  be  considered  to  exist  where  the  electronic  commerce operations carried on through computer equipment at a given location in a country are restricted to the preparatory or auxiliary activities  …  The  question  of  whether  particular  activities performed at such a location [are of a preparatory or auxiliary character] needs to be examined on a case-by-case basis having regard  to  the  various  functions  performed  by  the  enterprise through that equipment.    Examples of activities which would generally be regarded as preparatory or auxiliary include:
3. -providing a communications link - much like a telephone line - between suppliers and customers;
4. -advertising of goods or services;
5. -relaying  information  through  a  mirror  server  for  security and efficiency purposes;
6. -gathering market data for the enterprise;
7. -supplying information.
129. Where, however, such functions form in themselves an essential and significant part of the business activity of the enterprise as a  whole,  or  where  other  core  functions  of  the  enterprise  are carried  on  through  the  computer  equipment,  these  would  go beyond [preparatory or auxiliary activities] and if the equipment constituted a fixed place of business of the enterprise … there would be a permanent establishment.'

27. If a computer equipment (e.g. server) is at the disposal of a non-Hong Kong  resident  person  (i.e.  owned  or  rented  by  the  non-Hong  Kong  resident person), the equipment, if constituting a fixed place of business, can be regarded as a permanent establishment if an essential and significant part of the business activity  of  the  person  is  conducted  through  the  equipment.    That  is,  if  the equipment is capable of concluding contracts, processing payments or delivering digital goods in Hong Kong even without the involvement of human activities in Hong Kong, the equipment would constitute a permanent establishment of the non-Hong  Kong  resident  person  in  Hong  Kong  since  the  operations  of  the equipment are an essential and significant part of the business activity of the person as a whole and cannot be considered preparatory or auxiliary.
28. Under  a  website  hosting  arrangement,  the  website  of  a  non-Hong Kong resident person may be hosted on a server operated by an internet service provider in Hong Kong.    If the server is not at the disposal of the non-Hong Kong  resident  person  and  the  website  does  not  constitute  a  fixed  place  of business, the non-Hong Kong resident person would not generally be regarded as  having  a  permanent  establishment  in  Hong  Kong  by  virtue  of  the  hosting arrangement.
29. In Galileo International Inc (c/o BSR &amp; Co) v DCIT (2007) 10 ITLR 858,  the  Indian  Income  Tax  Appellate  Tribunal  held  that  Galileo-US  was carrying  on  its  business  of  developing  and  maintaining  a  fully  automatic reservation  and  distribution  system  wholly  or  partly  through  the  computers installed  at  the  premises  of  the  travel  agents  in  India  thereby  constituting  a permanent  establishment  in  India.    The  travel  agents  in  India  reserved  and booked  tickets  through  the  computers  connected  to  the  global  computerised reservation system owned and operated by Galileo-US.    Since the reservation and booking activities were part and parcel of the entire computerised reservation system of Galileo-US, they were not of a preparatory or auxiliary character.
30. In Re Application of MasterCard Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (2018) 21 ITLR 42,  the  Indian  Authority  for  Advance  Ruling  held  that  MasterCard  Interface Processors (MIPs) placed at the site of the customer banks in India constituted a fixed place permanent establishment of MasterCard-Singapore in India.    The role  of  the  MIPs  in  the  authorisation  process  was  significant  and  not  merely preparatory  or  auxiliary  since  the  authorisation  could  not  happen  without  the initial verification/validation by the MIPs.

## Example 4

Corporation-F, resident in Jurisdiction-F, carried on a business of selling  products  through  the  internet.    It  operated  a  server  at  its disposal in Hong Kong which hosted a website used exclusively for advertising, displaying a catalogue of products and  providing information  to  potential  customers.    The  core  operations  typically related to a sale (e.g. the conclusion of contracts with the customer, the processing of the payment and the delivery of the products) were not performed through the server.

Corporation F, not in the business of operating servers, was only an etailer carrying on the business of selling products through the internet. Since  the  activities  performed  through  the  server  were  merely preparatory  or  auxiliary  to  Corporation  F's  business  of  selling products on the internet, the server would not constitute a permanent establishment in Hong Kong.

## Example 5

Corporation-F,  resident  in  Jurisdiction  F,  was  engaged  in  the provision  of  online  audio,  video  and  web  conferencing  services. Users from any parts of the world could access the services through Corporation-F's  website.    After  completing  the  prescribed  online application  form  and  making  the  payment  via  Corporation-F's website, a specific one-time passcode would be generated for users to access the services.    Corporation-F had no employees or office in Hong Kong.    In addition, Corporation-F did not engage any service providers  to  conduct  marketing  services  of  its  service  offerings  in Hong Kong.

Scenario 1: Corporation-F leased from a third party service provider a primary datacenter in Hong Kong that supported the provision of the services and an arm's length service fee was paid to the service provider for maintaining the datacenter.

If the datacenter was at the disposal of Corporation-F and an essential and  significant  part  of  the  business  activity  of  Corporation-F  was

conducted  through  or  from  the  datacenter,  the  datacenter  could  be regarded as a permanent establishment.    Profits would be attributed to  the  Hong  Kong  datacentre  as  a  permanent  establishment  in accordance with the rules in section 50AAK(2)  and  assessed accordingly.

Scenario 2: The primary datacenter that supported the provision of the services was located and maintained outside Hong Kong.

If Corporation-F did not have any core operations or support activities performed  in  Hong  Kong,  Corporation-F  would  not  currently  be chargeable to profits tax since it was trading with and not trading in Hong  Kong.    The  answer  could  differ  if  new  nexus  and  profit allocation rules are adopted in Hong Kong after completion of work on a consensus-based and long-term solution to the tax challenges of the digitalisation of the economy.

## TRANSFER PRICING

## Attribution of profits to e-commerce permanent establishment

31. Section 50AAK(2) (i.e. Rule 2) provides that the income or loss of a non-Hong Kong resident person that is attributable to a permanent establishment of the person in Hong Kong are those that the permanent establishment would have made in circumstances where it were a distinct and separate enterprise that:
2. (a) engaged  in  the  same  or  similar  activities  under  the  same  or similar conditions; and
3. (b) dealt wholly independently with the person.

The amount of income or loss of the person that is attributed to the permanent establishment in accordance with section 50AAK(2) is referred to as the arm's length amount.

32. In the context of e-commerce, the authorised OECD approach is to be applied to attribute profits to a permanent establishment.    It is basically a two-

step approach: use functional and factual analysis to hypothesise the permanent establishment as a distinct and separate enterprise; and apply the arm's length principle to the hypothetical enterprise in accordance with the OECD Transfer Pricing  Guidelines  for  Multinational  Enterprises  and  Tax  Administrations (TPG), published on 10 July 2017, by analogy.    Since intangible assets may be important in the earning of profits from e-commerce transactions, it is necessary to determine which part of the enterprise economically owns and has created the intangible assets used by the permanent establishment.

## Example 6

Corporation-F was a corporation resident in Jurisdiction-F that sold goods  through  an  online  platform  directly  to  customers  in  various markets  including  Hong  Kong.    The  goods  were  purchased  from unrelated suppliers.    Corporation-F operated a warehouse in Hong Kong which was staffed by 25 employees.    Corporation-F leased the warehouse  from  an  unrelated  owner.    The  employees  handled  the receipt of shipments from suppliers, the stocking of the goods, and the execution of deliveries to customers in Hong Kong, using independent delivery service providers, in accordance with instructions from the head office of Corporation-F.    Corporation-F also had an office in Hong Kong which was located in a different place than the warehouse. Corporation-F's  office  was  staffed  by  15  employees,  which  were responsible for the merchandising of its products and the collection of information from its customers in Hong Kong.

On  the assumption that the business activities carried on by Corporation-F at the warehouse and at the office constituted complementary  functions  which  were  part  of  a  cohesive  business operation,  the  warehouse  and  the  office  constituted  two  permanent establishments in Hong Kong, as each of these locations was a fixed place of business through which the business of Corporation-F was partly carried on, and the overall activity resulting from the combination of the activities carried on in Hong Kong was not of a preparatory or auxiliary character.

The profits attributable to the warehouse in Hong Kong were those that would have been derived as if the permanent establishment were

a separate and independent enterprise performing the same storage and delivery  activities.    The  profits  attributable  to  the  office  in  Hong Kong were those that would have been derived as if the permanent establishment were a separate and independent enterprise performing the  same  merchandising  and  collection  activities.    In  doing  so,  it would be necessary to undertake a functional and factual analysis to attribute to each permanent establishment the rights and obligations arising  out  of  the  transactions  between  Corporation-F  of  which  the permanent establishment was a part and the third party enterprises (e.g. the  owner  of  the  warehouse  and  the  independent  delivery  service providers).    It  is  also  necessary  to  apply  the  TPG  by  analogy  to determine the arm's length pricing of the internal dealings between the permanent establishments in Hong Kong and the head office.

## Pricing of transaction between associated persons

33. Section 50AAF (i.e. Rule 1) requires income or loss from a provision between  associated  persons  to  be  computed  on  an  arm's  length  basis.    In transactions  between  two  independent  enterprises,  compensation  usually  will reflect  the  functions  that  each  enterprise  performs  (taking  into  account  assets used and risks assumed). In delineating a controlled transaction and determining comparability between controlled and uncontrolled transactions or entities,  a  functional  analysis  is  necessary.    The  functional  analysis  seeks  to identify the economically significant activities and responsibilities undertaken, assets used or contributed, and risks assumed by the associated enterprises in relation to the controlled transaction.    For the purposes of such analysis, it is necessary  to  understand  the  structure  and  organisation  of  the  multinational enterprise  group  to  which  the  associated  enterprises  belong,  how  value  is generated  by  the  group  as  a  whole,  the  interdependencies  of  the  functions performed by the enterprises with the rest of the group, and the contribution that the enterprises make in the value creation chain.

## Example 7

Corporation-F, resident in Jurisdiction-F, operated websites offering free online services to customers worldwide including Hong Kong and served as the legal counterparty for all sales of advertising. Advertisement service contracts with Corporation-F could be

concluded electronically through its websites on the basis of standard agreements.    To promote the advertising services of Corporation-F in  Hong  Kong,  Associated  Corporation-HK  provided  technical consultancy  services  to  potential  advertising  clients  and  marketing support to generate demand for the advertising services of Corporation-F.    In  consideration  of  its  promotion  activities  and technical support, Associated Corporation-HK was remunerated by Corporation F with a fee covering its expenses plus a mark-up.

Customers  concluded  contracts  with  Corporation-F  electronically through  its  website  using  standardised  contracts  while  the  staff  of Associated Corporation-HK lacked the authority to conclude contracts on behalf of Corporation-F.    If Associated Corporation-HK was not a dependent agent permanent establishment of Corporation-F, it would not be necessary to apply section 50AAK (i.e. Rule 2).    If the markup did not reflect the functions performed and the level of risks borne by Associated Corporation-HK as a service provider, the provisions in section 50AAF (i.e. Rule 1) would be applicable.

## CHARACTERISATION OF INCOME

## Consideration for payments

34. Products  and  services  can  be  provided  to  customers  in  new  ways through digital technology.    Payments arising from e-commerce transactions, in  particular  those  allowing  customers  to  order  electronically  and  download digital products, raise the question how such payments should be categorised for tax  purposes. To  answer  this  question,  it  is  important  to  identify  the consideration of the payments made to the provider of products or services.    If the payments are for the use of, or the right to use, a copyright, the payments would constitute royalties.    If the payments are for something other than the use of,  or  the  right  to  use,  rights  in  a  copyright  (e.g.  to  acquire  other  types  of contractual rights, data or services) and the use of a copyright is limited to such rights  as  are  required  to  enable  downloading,  storage  and  operation  on  the customer's computer, network or other storage, performance or display device, the payments would not be regarded as royalties.

## Right to use copyright

35. Copyright  may  subsist  in  literary  works  (e.g.  computer  software), musical works (e.g. musical compositions) and artistic works (e.g. drawings and sound  recordings).    Depending  on  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  e-commerce transactions involving computer software and other digital products (e.g. images, sounds and text) may give rise to the use of, or the right to use, a copyright by the  person  making  the  payments.    Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  examine  the nature of the right that the person (i.e. the payer) acquires regarding the use and exploitation of the computer software or digital products.
2. (a) If the person is granted a right or licence to reproduce, modify or exploit the software, the payments are consideration for the use  of  or  the  right  to  use  the  copyright  in  the  software  and would  constitute  royalties.    For  example,  the  right  to  make copies  for  distribution  to  the  public,  the  right  to  prepare derivative  programs  and  the  right  to  publicly  display  the software program.
3. (b) If the rights acquired in relation to the copyright are limited to those  necessary  to  enable  the  person  to  operate  the  software (e.g. copy the software onto the person's computer hard disk or make copies of the software under a network licence), the rights in  relation  to  the  act  of  copying  are  merely  to  enable  the effective operation of the software on the person's computer or network.    Such  rights  can  be  disregarded  in  analysing  the nature of the payments and the payments would not generally be treated as royalties.

## Incidental right

36. Though  the  act  of  downloading  electronically  software  or  digital products  (e.g.  images,  sounds  and  text)  may  strictly  constitute  the  use  of  a copyright by the person (i.e. a right to make one or more copies of digital content is granted), the extent of such use has to be carefully considered.
2. (a) If payments are for acquiring digital signals or content and the

- use  of  a  copyright  is  merely  incidental  to  the  process  of acquiring, capturing and storing the digital signals, the payments  would  not  be  royalties. For  example,  a  user downloaded  a  software  program  for  the  user's  own  use  or enjoyment only.
- (b) If  payments  are  not  merely  for  acquiring  digital  signals  or content but for the grant of the right to use a copyright in the downloadable software or digital product, the payments would be  royalties.    For  example,  a  book  publisher  downloaded  a copyrighted picture for use in a book which will be published for sale.

## Sums deemed trading receipts

37. The characterisation issue is most relevant for non-resident persons who do not carry on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong.    Section 15(1) specifies a number of 'sums' that are deemed to be receipts arising in or derived from Hong Kong from a trade, profession or business carried on in Hong Kong.    In other words, even if a person is not carrying on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong, the person may still be caught by the deeming provisions under certain circumstances.
38. Section 15(1)(b) and (ba) is particularly relevant in the context of ecommerce  since  payments  can  be  for  the  use  of,  or  the  right  to  the  use, copyright material.    If the payments arising from an e-commerce transaction are for a product or service, section 15(1)(b) and (ba) would not be applicable.    If the payments, not otherwise chargeable to profits tax, are for the use of, or the right to the use, copyright material, the payments would be deemed to be taxable receipts under section 15(1)(b) or (ba) as the case may be.
39. Where a non-resident person is chargeable to tax in respect of the sums deemed under section 15(1)(b) or (ba), the tax is charged under section 20B in the  name  of  the  person  in  Hong  Kong  who  paid  or  credited  the  sums.    The person in Hong Kong would have a withholding obligation to deduct at the time the person makes the payment or credit to the non-resident person an amount sufficient to meet the tax.

## Example 8

Corporation-F, resident in Jurisdiction-F, was an application service provider.    It  had  a  licence  to  use  a  software  application  which automated a particular back-office function (e.g. payment). Corporation-F  owned  and  operated  a  server  in  Jurisdiction-F  on which  the  software  application  was  hosted.    Corporation-HK,  an online seller, paid Corporation-F under a service contract for using the software application to automate the payment function. Corporation-HK's  right  to  use  the  software  was  restricted  to  the running of the application on the server of Corporation-F. Corporation-HK  had  no  right  to  copy  the  software  or  to  use  the software  other  than  on  Corporation-F's  server  and  did  not  have possession or control of the software copy.

Corporation-F  merely  provided  Corporation-HK  with  the  means  to automate and manage its receipts and payments of goods.    Given the limited right of use granted to Corporation-HK, the payments received by Corporation-F would not be royalties.    If Corporation-F did not carry  on  a  business  in  Hong  Kong,  Corporation-F  would  not  be chargeable to profits tax in respect of the service income. Corporation-HK would not have any withholding tax obligation.

## Example 9

Corporation-HK was a server operator.    To attract users in Hong Kong to visit its website hosted on a server located in Hong Kong, Corporation-HK paid Corporation-F, resident in Jurisdiction-F, for providing online content to be displayed on its website.

Scenario  1:  Copyright  in  the  online  content  was  not  acquired  by Corporation-HK from Corporation-F.

The payments, which were made to Corporation-F were for the right to display the online content in Hong Kong, would constitute royalties. Even though Corporation-F did not carry on a business Hong Kong, the payments would be deemed to be taxable receipts under section 15(1)(b). Corporation-HK would be required to fulfil the withholding tax obligation under section 20B.

Scenario  2:  New  online  content  was  specifically  created  under  a service contract by Corporation-F for Corporation-HK.

If Corporation-HK became the copyright owner of the online content, the  payments  to  Corporation-F  would  not  constitute  royalties.    If Corporation-F did not carry on a business in Hong Kong, it would not be  chargeable  to  profits  tax  in  respect  of the service  income. Corporation-HK would not have any withholding tax obligation.

## Applicable article in a DTA

40. The question for tax treaty purposes is whether the payments arising from e-commerce transactions are to be treated as business profits or royalties under the business profits article or the royalties article of a DTA.    It should be clear that the characterisation of the payments as business profits or royalties can result in different treatment under the DTA.

## DIGITAL ASSETS

## Nature of digital assets

41. Digital assets are digital representations of value and can be transferred, stored or traded electronically (e.g. cryptocurrencies, cryptoassets or digital tokens).    They may not be backed by physical assets or guaranteed by the government, and they may have no intrinsic value depending on the exact nature of the token.    Their prices on the secondary market are driven by supply and demand, and are short-term and volatile by nature.

## Classification of digital tokens

42. Digital tokens can be broadly classified into three categories:
2. (a) Payment tokens are used as a means of payment for goods or services and encompass cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin).    They do not provide the holder with any rights or access to goods or services.    Such tokens are not legal tender in Hong Kong but are regarded as virtual commodities.

- (b) Security tokens provide the holder with particular interests and rights in a business.    They represent ownership interests in the business, a debt due by the business or entitlement to a share of profits in the business.
- (c) Utility  tokens  provide  the  holder  with  access  to  particular goods  or  services which  are  typically  provided  using  a blockchain  platform. The  token  issuer  would  normally commit to accepting the tokens as payment for the particular goods or services.

Profits tax treatment of digital tokens would depend on their nature and use.

## Security tokens that are securities

43. Currently,  there  is  no  specific  legislation  or  regulation  for  digital assets  in  Hong  Kong.    Where  the  digital  tokens  constitute  'securities'  as defined  in  the  Securities  and  Futures  Ordinance  (Cap.  571),  the  tokens  and activities involving such tokens (e.g. initial coin offering, fund management and distribution, and provision of trading services) would be subject to the regulation by  the  Securities  and  Futures  Commission. Provisions  in  the  Ordinance relating  to  securities  and  collective  investment  schemes  (e.g.  section  20AM) would then be of relevance.

## Initial coin offering

44. An initial  coin  offering  (ICO)  involves  the  issuance  of  new  digital tokens by an issuer to the subscribers (i.e. token holders) in exchange for their cryptocurrency or fiat currency.    An ICO is typically accompanied by a 'white paper' which sets out the details of the business proposal of the issuer and the terms of the ICO, including the rights to be conferred on the token holders.    The substantive nature of the token itself will determine its classification and not the stated intention of the issuer.    In practice, ICOs are commonly used by project operators  to  raise  funds  for  a  particular  blockchain-related  project  (e.g.  to develop a new blockchain platform or software) which the token holders can subsequently access.

45. ICOs can be structured in different ways and, as a result,  different rights and benefits would be attached to the digital tokens.    The Commissioner would review the white paper or any other underlying documents of an ICO and examine what rights and benefits (e.g. equity interests or a right to access to a future service similar to a voucher) are attached to the digital tokens.    From the perspective of the issuer, the tax treatment of the proceeds from an ICO generally follows from the attributes of the tokens that are issued.    It is the nature of the rights and obligations of the tokens, not the form in which the tokens are issued, that determine the tax treatment.    By way of illustration:
2. (a) If digital tokens  offered in an ICO  represent  equity  or ownership interests in the issuer (i.e. security tokens), which is also  known as a security token offering, the proceeds of the ICO would be capital in nature since the token holders would be given shareholders' rights (e.g. the right to receive dividend).
3. (b) If digital tokens offered in an ICO give the token holders a right to  future  benefits  (i.e.  utility  tokens)  without  any  equity  or ownership  interests,  such  tokens  would  require  the  issuer  to supply  a  good  to  or  perform  a  service  for  the  token  holder. The proceeds of the ICO would be viewed as a prepayment for future goods or services.    The timing of revenue recognition would  depend  on  the  details  of  the  issuer's  performance obligations  and  should  be  determined  in  line  with  generally accepted  accounting  principles. Subject  to  any  specific exemptions provided, profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong from the ICO can be charged to profits tax in accordance with the general principles in section 14.

## Digital assets held for investment

46. Profits arising from the sale of capital assets are excluded from the charge of profits tax.    If digital assets are bought (e.g. through ICO or exchange platform) for long-term investment purposes, any profits from disposal would not be chargeable to profits tax.    Whether the digital assets are capital assets or trading stock has to be considered on the basis of the facts and circumstances. Well-established tax principles like the 'badges of trade' would continue to be applicable  and  the  intention  at  the  time  of  acquisition  of  the  digital  assets  is always relevant to decide whether they are capital assets or trading stock.
