## PART I -SHARE OPTION BENEFITS

## INTRODUCTION

The  purpose  of  this  part  of  the  Practice  Note  is  to  outline  the assessing practice followed by the Inland Revenue Department (the Department)  in  relation  to  benefits  obtained  from  share  option  schemes  by employees  and  office  holders.    Typically,  an  employee  receives  a  right  to acquire shares at a nominated price some time in the future.  Usually the shares are  in  the  employer  company  itself  or  in  a  related  company  (e.g.  the  parent company  of  the  employer  or  another  company  in  the  same  group).  The employee is not obliged to make any purchase until he 'exercises' the option. Accordingly,  there  is  an  incentive  for  such  an  employee  to  work  towards making  the  company  concerned  more  profitable  or  valuable,  which  would increase his or her likelihood of being able to make a gain through exercising the right and acquiring the shares.

## Taxation treatment prior to the introduction of specific provisions

2. The  Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  (the  Ordinance)  has  since  1971 contained specific provisions relating to the taxation of benefits received from employee  share  option  schemes.    Prior  to  their  introduction,  a  share  option benefit  would  be  charged  to  Salaries  Tax  if  it  could  be  regarded  as  a 'perquisite'  and  hence,  by  virtue  of  section  9(1)(a)  of  the  Ordinance,  fall within  the  inclusive  definition  of  income  from  an  office  or  employment  of profit.    In  the  absence  of  any  decision  from  the  courts  in  Hong  Kong concerning share option benefits, guidance on the issue of what constituted a chargeable perquisite was obtained from United Kingdom cases.
3. In  1961  the  House  of  Lords  handed  down  a  decision  in Abbott  v. Philbin 39 TC 82 ,  which had considerable impact on the taxation of benefits associated with share option schemes.  The decision was important not only in that it provided guidance as to what should be regarded as a perquisite, but also in that it led to the introduction of specific share option provisions in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.
4. The taxpayer concerned in Abbott v. Philbin was the secretary of a company that had decided to grant options over certain shares to executives of

the company and its subsidiaries.  The taxpayer was offered the opportunity to acquire at a cost of £1 for every 100 shares a non-transferable option, valid for ten years, to purchase 2,000 shares at the market price ruling at the date of the offer.  The taxpayer accepted the offer in October 1954.  The following year the  taxpayer  exercised  his  right  under  the  option  and  applied  for  and  was allotted 250 shares at the specified option price.

5. In  accordance  with  what  was  then  the  normal  practice  of  the Revenue, a sum equal to the difference between the current market price and the  amount  paid  for  the  shares  (plus  a  proportionate  part  of  the  cost  of  the option)  was  included  in  the  taxpayer's  assessment  for  the  year  in  which  the option was exercised. However, the House of Lords held that the benefit of the option  contract  could  be  converted  into  money,  even  though  it  was  nonassignable  (the  employee  could  have  obtained  money  from  a  third  party  by agreeing  to  exercise  the  option  when  instructed  and  thereupon  transfer  the shares), and that as such it was a perquisite which was taxable on its value at the time of grant and not on the value when exercised.
6. The law relating to share options was subsequently amended in the United Kingdom to, in effect, over-rule the decision in Abbott v. Philbin .    In essence, the legislation gave statutory support to what had been the Revenue's earlier practice in respect of binding option rights.

## Amendments in Hong Kong

7. The  UK  amendments  were  considered  locally  in  the  course  of  the deliberations  of  the  Second  Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  Review  Committee, which delivered  its  final  Report  to  the  Government  in  1968.    The  following excerpt from the Report is pertinent -
2. '169.  The Commissioner asked us to consider the introduction of a provision  for  determining  the  value  of  income  derived  by  an employee  from  the  exercise  of  an  option  to  take  up  shares  in  the corporation  which  employs  him.    We  noted  that  it  has  been  found necessary in the U.K. to lay down the basis for determining the value to  be  treated  as  income.  The  principle  which  the  Commissioner wished  to  establish  is  that  the  value  to  be  brought  to  charge  as income should be calculated, and should be deemed to arise, at the

time the option is exercised.  The income to be charged should be the difference between -

- (a) the  open  market  value  of  the  shares  at  the  date  of exercise of the option (or in the case of an assignment or release, the consideration received for the assignment or release); and
- (b) the cost of acquiring the shares including any consideration (apart from services in his office or employment) which the employee gave for the option.
170. WE  RECOMMEND  that  there  should  be  included,  as  an additional paragraph to Section 9(1), 'any gain made by a director or employee of a corporation from the exercise of a right, obtained from the  corporation,  to  acquire  shares  therein'  and  that  the  principle which the Commissioner wished to establish should also be incorporated in the enabling provisions.'
8. The  Ordinance  was  subsequently  amended  by  Inland  Revenue (Amendment) Ordinance 1971 to introduce, amongst other provisions, section 9(1)(d),  9(4)  and  9(5).    The  Explanatory  Memorandum  of  the  Bill  for  the Amendment Ordinance contained the following -
- ' The principal purpose of this Bill is to implement recommendations  contained  in  Part  II  of  the  Report  of  the  Inland Revenue Ordinance Review Committee.

....

6. Clause 6 (which follows section 25 of the U.K. Finance Act 1966)  amends  section  9  by  adding  new  subsections  (4)  and  (5)  to provide  for  the  charge  to  tax  of  any  share  options  acquired  by  a person as a result of his employment.  The manner of valuation of such options for tax purposes is also provided for.'  [at C646]
9. The amendments were agreed as proposed by the Legislative Council without comment.

## SCHEME OF THE LEGISLATION

10. Briefly, the legislation has the following three main elements -
2.  The first, section  9(1)(d) , in  effect  provides  that  income from an  office  or  employment  includes  any  gain  realized  by  the exercise, assignment or release of a share option obtained by a person as an employee or office holder of a company.
3.  The second, section  9(4) ,  specifies  the  basis  of  calculation  of any realized gain that comes within the scope of section 9(1)(d).
4.  The  third, section  9(5) ,  provides  that  where  a  gain  may  be taxable by virtue of section 9(1)(d) in respect of the exercise of a right, the receipt of the right cannot be charged to tax under any other provision of the Ordinance.

The three elements are further discussed below, together with related matters.

## Section 9(1)(d)

'any gain realized by the exercise of, or by the assignment or release of, a right to acquire shares or stock ...'

11. Section  9(1)(d)  only  has  application  where  an  employee  (or  office holder) has exercised, assigned or released a 'right' to acquire shares. In this regard it is accepted that the term 'right' refers to a legally enforceable right; not a 'mere expectation', such as where a person is invited to apply for shares in circumstances where the invitation may be withdrawn at any time.  It should be  noted,  however,  that  in  the  latter  situation  a  taxable  perquisite  would generally be received if an application were to be accepted and shares allotted. Such a perquisite, if meeting the other requirements for chargeability, would be taxable to the extent of the difference between the price for which the shares could be sold and the price paid for them: Weight v. Salmon 19 TC 174 .
12. The taxpayer in that case was the managing director of a company. In addition to a fixed salary, he was given the privilege each year of applying for  unissued  shares  at  their  par  value,  which  was  less  than  the  market  value.

The taxpayer accordingly applied for shares and they were issued to him.  He was assessed to tax on the difference between the par and market values at the date the shares were allotted.  The case eventually came before the House of Lords where the assessment was upheld. The decision was considered in Abbott v.  Philbin where Lord Reid, at page 123, emphasised that that case could be distinguished as a binding option had not been involved -

'The case of Weight v. Salmon seems to me to be entirely different. There  the  servant  had  no  enforceable  right  at  all  until  he  got  his shares.    He  got  his  shares  because  the  company  chose  to  give  him something  then,  to  give  him  a  perquisite  when  the  shares  were issued.  But, in this case, the  Appellant getting his shares did not flow from any voluntary act of the company when the shares were issued.  It flowed from the company's voluntary act in the previous year, when they gave him an option by which they were thereafter bound.    It  would,  I  think,  require  some  peculiar  circumstances  to make  a  mere  expectation  capable  of  being  turned  to  pecuniary account.'

13. The respective meanings of the terms 'exercise' , 'assignment' and 'release' ,  within the context of these provisions, are discussed in paragraphs 16 to 32 below, in relation to section 9(4).
2. '... shares or stock in a corporation obtained by a person as the holder of an office in or an employee of that or any other corporation'
14. The words in section 9(1)(d) quoted above dictate that the following points  should  be  kept  in  mind  when  considering  the  application  of  the  share option provisions -
4.  The provisions can only apply where an option (i.e. a right to acquire  shares  or  stock  in  a  corporation)  is  obtained  by  an employee  of  a  company  or  by  the  holder  of  an  office  in  a company.  Where such an option is obtained by a person who is employed  other  than  by  a  company  (e.g.  by  a  partnership), chargeability generally depends on whether the option itself can be regarded as a perquisite, under section 9(1)(a), derived from Hong Kong (see paragraphs 2-5 above).

-  For the provisions to apply, the shares (or stock) to which the option relates need not be in the company in which the person concerned is an employee or office  holder.    For  example,  the option  could  be  granted  in  respect  of  shares  in  the  overseas parent company of the local company employing the taxpayer.

## Section 9(4)

15. As  has  been  indicated  above,  section  9(4)  must  be  applied  to ascertain  the  quantum  of  any  gain  that  comes  within  the  scope  of  section 9(1)(d). In this regard -
2.  section 9(4)(a) details what is taken to be 'the gain realized ' where  a  right  of  a  kind  referred  to  in  section  9(1)(d)  is exercised; and
3.  section  9(4)(b)  similarly  provides  for  cases  where  the  gain  is realized by assignment or release of such a right.

## Section 9(4)(a)

## '... by the exercise'

16. The Ordinance does not define what is meant by the word 'exercise' in the context of section 9(1)(d).  Nor is it possible, given the great variety of terms and conditions which can govern the operation of share option schemes, to  state  exhaustively  how  the  word  is  construed  in  practice.    Generally, however,  a  taxpayer  is  considered  to  have  exercised  an  option  when  he  has taken whatever steps are necessary to convert the offer contained in the option agreement into a contract to purchase the relevant shares.  Depending on the terms  of  the  option  agreement,  this  may  require  no  more  than  the  employee providing the party concerned with written confirmation of acceptance of the offer.  On the other hand, an agreement may contain provisions that deem an option to be validly exercised only when particular requirements are satisfied (e.g.  that  payment  for  the  shares  be  made  in  a  certain  manner  or  that  the 'exercise' of the option be approved by the board of directors of the company). Provided  that  they  are  genuine  and  have  not  been  inserted  with  a  view  to facilitating tax avoidance, such  requirements  will be recognised  by  the Department in ascertaining the time of exercise of an option.

## The critical time

17. It  is  important  to  ascertain  the  point  in  time  at  which  an  option  is exercised.  This is because section 9(4)(a) provides, briefly put, that the gain realized by 'the exercise at any time' of a share option is based on the amount which could  be  obtained  for  the  shares  acquired  in  the  open  market  'at  that time'.  In other words, the gain is required to be calculated by reference to the open market value on the day of exercise and it will generally not be relevant to consider value at any later date.  However, following the decision of the Board of Review in case D43/99, IRBRD, vol. 14, 448 , if a taxpayer can establish that because  of  circumstances  beyond  his  control  he  did  not  acquire  the  relevant shares  (in  the  sense  that  the  shares  had  been  issued  to  him)  until  a  date subsequent to the date of exercise, the Department will accept the adoption of that  later  date  for  the  purposes  of  the  provisions.    It  should  be  pointed  out, however,  that  in  case D120/02,  IRBRD,  vol.  18,  125 ,  the  Board  drew  a distinction between 'a share certificate' and 'a share'.  The Board held that a share could be regarded as a bundle of rights, the non-availability of the share certificate  did  not  prevent  the  vesting  of  the  rights  and  thus  the  Appellant  in that  case  acquired  the  shares  when  her  name  was  entered  in  the  Register  of Shareholders and became entitled to dividends and voting rights.

## A notional gain must be computed

18. The gain that has to be calculated is a notional one; the question of chargeability does not depend on whether or not the employee sells the shares acquired as a result of exercising the option.  Even if no sale takes place, such as where the shares are held as an investment, the employee will nonetheless be chargeable (assuming that the income has a Hong Kong source) in respect of any notional profit arrived at as a result of the application of section 9(4)(a) to the circumstances at the time of the exercise of the option. Any subsequent gain derived from the actual sale of the shares would not be subject to Salaries Tax.

## Computation method

19. Section 9(4)(a) provides, broadly put, that for the purposes of section 9(1)(d) the gain realized by the exercise at any time of an option shall be taken to be the difference between (a) the amount which a person might reasonably expect to obtain from a sale in the open market, at the time of exercise of the

option, of the shares acquired and (b) the amount or value of the consideration given for the shares and the grant of the option.

20. Section  9(4)  also  provides  that  the  entire  consideration  shall  be apportioned if it is for something beside the shares covered by the option.  A proviso to the subsection makes it clear that the consideration cannot include any  amount  in  respect  of  the  performance  of  the  duties  of  the  office  or employment, and that the amount or value of the consideration given for the grant of the option cannot be deducted more than once.

## Open market value

## Restrictions on sale

21. Share options are sometimes granted on the condition that restrictions will apply in relation to the disposal of any shares acquired under the  scheme  (e.g.  as  to  when  or  to  whom  the  shares  can  be  sold).      The restriction  on  disposal  of  the  shares  are  relevant  in  determining  the  amount 'which  a  person  might  reasonably  expect  to  obtain  from  a  sale  in  the  open market'.  This is a valuation exercise to be undertaken in the light of the facts of each particular case, see for example, D120/02, IRBRD vol. 18, 125 , where a 25%  discount  was  allowed  to  reflect  the  five  year  restriction  period  against alienation of the shares.

## Quoted shares

22. Where the  shares  are  listed  on  a  stock  exchange,  the  open  market value  of  the  shares  acquired  can  be  taken  as  the  closing  quotation  value  for shares  of  the  same  kind  on  the  date  the  option  is  exercised.    In  practice,  the Department  will  consider  a  request  for  downward  adjustment  of  the  quoted value if  there  is  evidence  to  suggest  that,  because  of  the  number  involved,  a sale of the shares obtained from exercising the option would only be possible at a reduced price, i.e. a 'slump effect' would be induced if the shares in question were to be made available for sale.  This practice reflects the decision of the Board of Review in case D46/95, IRBRD, vol. 10, 308 .  If the shares are listed in  Hong  Kong  and  overseas  at  the  same  time,  it  is  normal  practice  for  the Department to adopt the price quoted on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  If

the  shares  are  listed  on  two  non-Hong  Kong  exchanges,  the  taxpayer  may select the more favourable price.

23. Once the open market value of the shares is ascertained, the gain for the purposes of section 9(1) (i.e. the amount to be treated as income from an office or employment)  is  arrived  at by  deducting  from  this figure the consideration given for the grant of the option and the consideration given for the  shares  in  question.    It  is  accepted  that  the  latter  amount  can  include  any brokerage,  stamp  duty  or  other  charges  that  would  have  been  levied  if  the notional sale had actually taken place.

## Unquoted shares

24. Where  the  option  exercised  is  in  respect  of  shares  in  a  private company (i.e. one which is not quoted on a recognised stock exchange at the date of exercise), it will generally not be possible to look to an actual sale of shares of the same kind to arrive at a valuation.  And, because of the variations in circumstances that may be involved, it is not possible to say that for all such companies  there  is  a  single  valuation  method  (e.g.  reference  to  'dividend yield', 'earnings yield' or 'asset backing') which could appropriately be used to determine the open market value.  It is also pertinent that the application of section 9(4)(a) in relation to such cases has not been considered by any court in Hong Kong.
25. Nevertheless, it is considered that guidance  as to the correct approach to  be  used  can  be  drawn  from  estate  duty  case-law  concerning  the open market value of private company shares. [See, for example: Commissioners  of  Inland  Revenue v. Crossman (1937)  AC  26 ;  In  re Lynall (DECD.)  (1971)  47  TC  375 ;  and  In  re Harry  Charrington  (DECD.)  (1975) HKLR 81 .]  In this regard, the Department considers that the correct objective is  to  ascertain  what  price  a  hypothetical  willing,  but  not  anxious,  purchaser would need to pay a hypothetical willing, but not anxious, seller in the open market  to  acquire  the  subject  shares  on  the  date  of  exercise  of  the  option. Furthermore, in undertaking this exercise it should be assumed that -
3.  the shares are offered for sale to the world at large so that all potential purchasers have an equal opportunity to make an offer as  a  result  of  it  being  openly  known  what  is  offered  for  sale ( Lynall p. 411);

-  the hypothetical purchaser would not rely only on information published by the company, but would also consider its prospects having regard to matters of public knowledge, at the date  of  exercise,  concerning  the  company,  its  directors  and management  and  relevant  business  trends  and  developments ( Lynall p. 411);
-  the seller would give as much information as he was entitled to give.    If  not  a  director,  he  would  provide  the  information  he could get as a shareholder. If he was a director with confidential information, it should not be assumed that it would be disclosed to the public without the consent of the board of directors of the company ( Lynall p. 406 &amp; p. 413);
-  the sale price paid would not be exceptional i.e. it should not be increased  over  what  could  be  regarded  as  an  ordinary  market price to reflect a premium a particular buyer might pay because of special reasons unique to that party ( Crossman p. 44);
-  any  conditions requiring satisfaction under  the articles of association  of  the  company  to  enable  an  open  market  sale  to take place would be satisfied (e.g. the directors of the company would  not  exercise  any  discretion  to  refuse  to  register  the transfer  of  the  shares,  and  any  existing  shareholder's  right  of pre-emption would be waived); and
-  following acquisition of the shares, the hypothetical purchaser would be subject to (and hence this would be reflected in the valuation)  any  restrictions  imposed  by  the  provisions  of  the articles  of  association  relevant  to  the  shares  in  question  (e.g. relating to the alienation and transfer of shares in the company).
26. Where  an  option  has  been  exercised  over  shares  in  a  private company, it will sometimes be useful for officers of the Department to meet representatives  of  the  company  (subject  to  the  appropriate  authority  being given by the employees concerned) with a view to agreeing the valuation on exercise.  Negotiations can begin as soon as the exercise has taken place and there is no need to wait until the end of the tax year.  In the first instance, a

request for a meeting should be sent to the Commissioner.  The request should be  accompanied  by  details  of  the  basis  of  valuation  proposed,  together  with relevant supporting documents.

## Section 9(4)(b)

27. Section 9(4)(b) provides for cases where a right to acquire shares is assigned or released.  The gain is taken to be the difference between the amount or value of the consideration for the assignment or release and the amount or value of the consideration for the grant of the right (i.e. the amount paid for the option).

## Assignment

28. In  the  context  of  section  9(4)(b),  it  is  considered  that  the  term 'assignment'  refers  to  the  situation  where  an  employee  (or  office  holder) transfers the whole of his interest in rights acquired under an option agreement to a third party.  In order to ascertain whether a purported assignment was for tax  avoidance  purposes,  the  Department  will  generally  require  copies  of  all agreements and other documentation relating to the grant of the option and the assignment to be submitted for consideration.  If it is not otherwise apparent, the employee (assignor) will also be required to advise -
2.  whether the option agreement prohibited any assignment and if so whether the prohibition was subsequently waived;
3.  whether the employer was notified of the assignment;
4.  whether  the  assignor  retained  any  interest  in  the  option  right and if so the nature of that interest;
5.  whether  the  party  to  whom  the  right  was  assigned  (i.e.  the assignee) could, as a result of the assignment, formally exercise the option;
6.  whether  any  vesting  period  under  the  option  agreement  had been completed prior to the assignment;

-  the  nature  of  the  relationship,  if  any,  of  the  assignor  to  the assignee;
-  the amount of and terms of payment of the consideration for the assignment; and
-  the basis used to decide upon the consideration in respect of the assignment.

## Release

29. Within the context of section 9(4)(b), the term 'release' refers to the situation  where  an  employee,  without  exercising  his  right  to  acquire  shares under  a  share  option  scheme,  agrees  to  the  discharge  of  that  right  either  for valuable consideration or under seal (i.e. release by deed).
30. To simply allow an option right to lapse by not exercising it within the option period would not amount to a 'release' within the context of section 9(4)(b).    Likewise,  if  an  employer  were  empowered  under  a  share  option agreement to unilaterally  cancel  an  option  right  in  certain  circumstances  and did so, this would not constitute a release.
31. It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  if  an  employee  were  to  receive compensation because he had suffered a loss as a result of having to delay the exercise  of  an  option,  the  compensation  would  be  regarded  as  a  perquisite chargeable to Salaries Tax (if derived from Hong Kong) by virtue of sections 8(1) and 9(1)(a) of the Ordinance: see the decision of the Board of Review in case D4/91, IRBRD, vol. 5, 542 .  By parity of reasoning, the same would apply in respect of any compensation received by an employee for agreeing to let an option  expire  without  exercising  it  (as  distinct  from  agreeing  to  the  legal discharge of the option).

## Exchange of rights

32. Cases sometimes arise where a right to acquire shares of a particular type is exchanged for a right to acquire shares of another type, e.g. as a result of a take-over or restructuring of a company. In such a case (i.e. where a straight exchange is involved, without the employee also receiving monetary

consideration), the Department will generally accept that the exchange does not constitute  an  assignment  or  release  for  the  purposes  of  section  9(1)(d). Accordingly, no Salaries Tax liability arises as a result of the exchange itself. Instead, the relevant provisions are applied in relation to the right received in exchange, when it is subsequently exercised, assigned or released (taking into account  any  consideration  given  for  the  grant  of  the  original  right).    The Department should be consulted regarding the appropriate basis of assessment, by writing to the Commissioner, in any case where the consideration received in exchange includes both a new right and a monetary payment.

## Section 9(5)

33. As has been indicated in paragraph 5 above, prior to the introduction of  the  specific  provisions  in  the  Ordinance  dealing  with  share  options,  if  an employee or office holder acquired an enforceable right to obtain shares in a company, the person concerned was assessable on the value of the right at the time of its grant, less any sum paid for it.  The specific provisions, on the other hand,  impose  liability  in  respect  of  the  subsequent  exercise,  assignment  or release  of  the  right.    The  role  of  section  9(5)  is  to  ensure  that  a  person  who acquires a right is not subject to double taxation i.e. in respect of the receipt of the  right  (as  a  perquisite)  and  under  the  specific  share  option  provisions.    In essence,  the  subsection  looks  ahead  and  provides  that  where  a  person  may become chargeable by virtue of section 9(1)(d) in respect of any gain which may be  realized  by  the  exercise  of  a  right,  the  person  cannot  be  charged  to Salaries Tax under any other provision in respect of the receipt of the right (i.e. on the basis that a perquisite falling within section 9(1)(a) has been received).
34. Section 9(5) would not prevent the receipt of a right being charged to Salaries Tax as a perquisite if it were to become apparent in a particular case that no amount would be chargeable by virtue of section 9(1)(d).  In practice, however, if at the time a right is obtained there is a possibility that an amount may eventually be chargeable by virtue of section 9(1)(d), the Department will not in any event (i.e. irrespective of the ultimate outcome) seek to charge an amount under any other provision.

## APPLYING THE PROVISIONS

## General principles

35. Apart from valuation issues, questions concerning the application of the share option provisions most frequently arise in relation to situations where employment  circumstances  change  between  the  time  of  grant  of  the  right  to acquire  the  shares  and  the  time  of  exercise  of  the  right,  and  cases  involving employees  who  have  non-Hong  Kong  employments.    In  considering  the various circumstances, it may be useful to keep the following points in mind -
2. (i) When a person is granted a right to acquire shares by virtue of his employment, he derives income in the form of a perquisite.    Normally,  if  derived  from  Hong  Kong,  the perquisite would be chargeable to Salaries Tax in the year of assessment in which the person obtains it.  However, by virtue of the specific provisions under section 9(1)(d) and 9(5), the person is not necessarily charged to tax in the year in which the perquisite is derived, but on a notional basis in the year of assessment  in  which  the  right  is  subsequently  exercised, assigned or released.
3. (ii) Section 9(1)(d) provides that any gain realized by the exercise, assignment or release of the rights constitutes 'income from employment'.
4. (iii) The  gain  in  respect  of  the  exercise  etc.  of  the  right  is calculated on a notional basis in accordance with section 9(4), and  is  assessable  to  the  extent  that  it  is  derived  from  Hong Kong.  The gain is taken to accrue to the taxpayer in the year of  assessment  in  which  the  right  is  exercised  etc.  and,  by virtue  of  section  11B,  falls  for  assessment  in  that  year  of assessment  (rather  than  the  year  in  which  the  benefit  of  the right was derived).
5. (iv) Section  9(1)(d)  and  associated  provisions  provide  for  the calculation and timing of any charge to Salaries Tax in respect of  a  share  right  benefit.    They  do  not,  however,  have  any

- bearing  on  the  question  of  when  the  benefit  is  actually derived,  which  is  determined  by  the  time  of  grant  of  the relevant right.
- (v) While some options are allowed to be exercised without any conditions, some may require certain conditions to be fulfilled before the option can be exercised.  The concept of 'vesting' is  common  in  share  options.    An  option  will  generally  be considered to have vested when all conditions for its exercise have  been  satisfied  and  the  employee  is  free  to  exercise without  restriction.    Among  the  typical  conditions,  it  is frequently  required  that  the  employee  continues  to  work  for the  employer  for  a  certain  period  of  time.    For  the  present purposes,  an  option  will  be  regarded  as  vested  when  such period has expired.  Therefore, 'vesting period' here normally means the period from the date of grant of option, or such date as  mentioned in the terms of the grant, to the first  available date that an employee is entitled to exercise the option.

## Hong Kong employment

36. Although section 9(1)(d) provides that any gain realized (calculated in accordance with section 9(4)), by the exercise, assignment or release of the rights  constitutes  'income  from  employment',  the  gain  is  only  chargeable  to Salaries  Tax  if  it  comes  within  the  scope  of  section  8(1)(a),  i.e.  if  it  can correctly be described as 'income arising in or derived from Hong Kong'.  In other  words,  one  has  to  consider  whether  the  income  had  a  source  in  Hong Kong.
37. The source of the income mentioned in  paragraph 36 above is the right to acquire shares obtained by the person as an employee.  As such, if the person had a Hong Kong employment at the time of the grant of the right, the income is  also regarded as having been derived from Hong Kong.  Any gain realized  by  the  subsequent  exercise  etc.  of  the  right  will  be  chargeable  to Salaries  Tax  unless  the  gain  is  excluded  by  virtue  of  section  8(1A)(b),  i.e. where the person renders  outside  Hong  Kong  all  the  services  in  connection with his employment.   In the latter regard, if a right is granted to an employee

on an unconditional basis during a year of assessment in which the person renders all services in respect of his employment outside Hong Kong, any gain subsequently  realized,  even  if  realized  whilst  the  person  is  working  in  Hong Kong will not be charged to Salaries Tax.  Although the gain is considered to accrue to the person in the year of assessment in which the right is exercised, it is recognised as having been derived from the services rendered outside Hong Kong.

## Example 1

The taxpayer had a Hong Kong employment.  He was granted an unconditional right to subscribe for shares.  He ceased employment and exercised his option after cessation of employment.

38. Cessation  of  employment  does  not  prevent  the  application  of  the share  option  provisions.    As  the  taxpayer  concerned  had  a  Hong  Kong employment at the time of grant of the right, the relevant income was derived from Hong Kong and accordingly is chargeable to Salaries Tax in the year of assessment  in  which  the  right  is  exercised.  It  should  be  noted  that  as  the application  of  section  9(1)(d)  is  concerned  with  notional  income,  rather  than any payment made to an employee, section 11D cannot apply in relation to the income - i.e.  it  cannot  act  to  deem  the  amount  to  have  been  received  by  the employee on the last day of his employment. Instead, the income simply falls to be  assessed  in  respect  of  the  year  of  assessment  in  which  it  accrued  to  the employee i.e. the year of assessment in which the right was exercised.  This approach  has  been  endorsed  in CIR  v.  Sawhney,  Subhash  Chander,  HCIA 1/2006 .

## Example 2

The taxpayer had a Hong Kong employment.  All services were rendered in Hong Kong prior to and during the year the unconditional grant of the right was  granted  to  him.    During  the  year  of  assessment  in  which  the  right  was exercised, the taxpayer rendered all services outside Hong Kong in connection with the same employment.

39. As the taxpayer had a Hong Kong employment, the gain would be treated  as  having  been  derived  from  Hong  Kong.    The  gain  would  only  be

excluded  from  the  charge  to  Salaries  Tax  by  virtue  of  section  8(1A)(b)(ii), taking into account section 8(1B), if all services were rendered outside Hong Kong in the year of grant of the right.  The gain, calculated in accordance with section 9(4), would fall for assessment in the year of assessment in which the right was exercised.  The fact that the taxpayer did not render any services in Hong Kong during the year of exercise would not in itself have any bearing on whether the gain would be chargeable to Salaries Tax, see D4/02, IRBRD, vol. 17, 400 .

## Example 3

The  taxpayer  had  a  Hong  Kong  employment.    All  services  were  rendered outside  Hong  Kong  in  the  year  of  assessment  in  which  the  right  was unconditionally  granted,  but  rendered  inside  Hong  Kong  during  the  year  of assessment in which the right was exercised.

40. As the taxpayer rendered all services outside Hong Kong during the year of assessment in which the right was granted, and as it was granted on an unconditional  basis  which  did  not  involve  services  being  rendered  in  Hong Kong,  it  would  be  accepted  that  the  gain  on  realization  should  qualify  for exemption by virtue of section 8(1A)(b)(ii), taking into account section 8(1B), notwithstanding the fact that the taxpayer was rendering services in Hong Kong during the year in which the right was actually exercised.

## Example 4

The  taxpayer  had  a  Hong  Kong  employment.    The  right  was  conditionally granted, subject to the completion of a vesting period of 2 years from 1 April 2000.  The position during the vesting period was as follows:

| Year ended   |                                                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 31.3.2001    | More than 60 days in Hong Kong rendering services |
| 31.3.2002    | No services rendered in Hong Kong                 |

He  exercised  the  option  on  1  July  2002.    During  the  year  ended  31  March 2003, he did not render service in Hong Kong.

41. The chargeability of any gain on exercise would not hinge on where (or if) the taxpayer was rendering services in the year of assessment in which the right was  exercised. Unlike  the  situation  with  a  non-Hong  Kong employment where the primary purpose is to ascertain the income derived from services rendered in Hong Kong, for a Hong Kong employment case, income can only be excluded from the charge to Salaries Tax if the taxpayer renders outside Hong Kong all the services in connection with his employment (taking into account the 60 days allowance provided under section 8(1B)).
42. Accordingly,  having  regard  to  the  latter  point  in  the  previous paragraph, if during any year of assessment included in the vesting period, the taxpayer rendered services in Hong Kong during visits exceeding 60 days, all of the gain from the exercise of the option would be chargeable to Salaries Tax. On the other hand, if during each such year the taxpayer's visits did not exceed a total of 60 days, no part of the gain would be treated as chargeable (section 8(1A)(b)(ii) and (1B) would apply).

## Non-Hong Kong employment

43. Where a person has a  non-Hong  Kong  employment  at  the  time  of grant, the gain will have a non-Hong Kong source and will not be chargeable to Salaries  Tax  unless  it  comes  within  the  scope  of  section  8(1A)(a)  i.e.  if  it  is derived from services rendered in Hong Kong. In this regard, the Department will  generally  accept  that  no  liability  to  Salaries  Tax  arises  where  a  right  is granted on an unconditional basis (or on completion of a vesting period of a conditional  grant)  prior  to  a  person  rendering  any  services  in  Hong  Kong, notwithstanding that the right may be exercised after the person commences to render such services.
44. The more complex situation is the one where a person with a nonHong Kong employment is granted the right subject to a vesting period during which  services  are  rendered  both  in  and  outside  Hong  Kong.    In  such  a situation,  it  is  considered  that  the  gain  on  the  subsequent  exercise  etc.  of  the right should not be fully assessable in Hong Kong as it can partly be attributed to services rendered outside Hong Kong.  On the other hand, because the gain can be partly attributed to services in Hong Kong, the benefit should to some extent be chargeable to Salaries Tax.

45. In considering the  appropriate  proportion, if any, of the gain to be treated  as  derived  from  services  rendered  in  Hong  Kong,  regard  must,  of course, be had to the terms of the contract governing the grant of the right and to  any  other  relevant  facts.    In  the  case  of  a  non-Hong  Kong  employment, however, the Department will generally accept that it is equitable to have regard  to  the  number  of  days  in  Hong  Kong  plus  leave  days  attributable  to services in Hong Kong during the period from the date of conditional grant to the date the employee became unconditionally entitled to exercise the right (i.e. the vesting period) to the total number of days in the period, notwithstanding that  it  may  only  be  exercised  after  a  further  period.    In  other  words,  the assessable  amount  of  the  gain  can  generally  be  arrived  at  by  applying  the following formula -

46. For example, if the vesting period was two years (i.e. 730 days) and the person's days in Hong Kong plus leave days attributable to service in Hong Kong were 292 days during the period, 40% of the gain would be assessable in the  year  of  exercise  of  the  right  (i.e.  292/730  =  40%).    For  the  purpose  of counting the number of days in Hong Kong, only one day is generally counted in respect of the days of arrival and departure (the so-called 'midnight rule'). This is consistent with the assessing practice usually applied in relation to time apportionment claims under section 8(1A)(a) and (c).

47. The  provisions  of  section  8(1A)(b)(ii),  as  read  with  section  8(1B), may  be  relevant  in  relation  to  the  calculation  of  the  proportion  referred  to above. By virtue of section 8(1A)(b)(ii), chargeable income does not include income derived from services rendered by a person who renders outside Hong Kong  all  the  services  in  connection  with  his  employment.    In  this  regard, section  8(1B)  provides  that  in  determining  whether  or  not  all  services  are rendered outside Hong Kong, services rendered during visits not exceeding a total of 60 days in the basis period for the year of assessment are not to be taken into  account.    Accordingly,  if  services  are  rendered  by  the  taxpayer  in Hong Kong during visits of less than 60 days during any year of assessment

that  falls  within  the  vesting  period,  the  days  concerned  are  not  taken  into account  in  computing  the  proportion  of  the  gain  attributable  to  services rendered in Hong Kong.  To illustrate, if in the example used in  paragraph 46 the  vesting  period  had  covered  the  period  1  January  2001  to  31  December 2002, and the taxpayer had only rendered services in Hong Kong for a total of 40 days during the 2000/01 year of assessment (with the remaining 252 of the total 292 'Hong Kong days' falling in 2001/02), the chargeable portion of the gain would be taken to be 34.52%, i.e. 252/730, when the option is exercised.

48. It  should  be  noted  that  for  the  purpose  of  determining  whether section  8(1B)  is  applicable  (i.e.  in  ascertaining  whether  or  not  services  were rendered in Hong Kong during visits exceeding a total of 60 days), the basis of counting days differs slightly from the 'midnight rule' referred to above.  More particularly,  the  decision  of  the  Board  of  Review  in  case D29/89,  IRBRD, vol. 4, 340 ,  is  applied,  where it was held that 'any part of a day counts as a 'day' for the purpose of section 8(1B)'. This decision was also followed in case D12/94, IRBRD, vol. 9, 131 .
49. The chargeable portion  of  a  gain  of  the  kind  referred  to  under  the previous  point is  calculated  separately  from  other  chargeable  income. Although  the  chargeable  portion  will  fall  for  assessment  in  the  year  of assessment  in  which  the  gain  is  realized,  it  is  calculated  by  reference  to  the 'days  in'  and  'days  out'  during  the  vesting  period,  which  may  have  taken place in earlier years of assessment.  The person's other assessable income, if any, is calculated separately (and may involve a different time apportionment calculation in respect of remuneration for services rendered during that year).
50. The Ordinance does not require that the person be currently employed at the time of exercise etc. for section 9(1)(d) to be applied.  Liability, if any, to assessment to Salaries Tax arises at the time the right is granted and cannot be extinguished  by  deferring  exercise  etc.  until  after  cessation  of  employment. Where  a  right  is  exercised  after  cessation,  the  gain  is  treated  as  assessable income for the year of assessment in which the exercise takes place (section 11D cannot apply to treat the gain as having accrued to the person on the last date of his employment as the exercise of a right does not involve any payment by the employer to the person).

## Example 5

The taxpayer had a non-Hong Kong employment.  All services were rendered outside  Hong  Kong  in  the  year  of  assessment  in  which  the  right  was unconditionally  granted,  but  rendered  inside  Hong  Kong  during  the  year  of assessment in which the right was exercised.

51. As the taxpayer rendered all services outside Hong Kong during the year of assessment in which the right was granted, and as it was granted on an unconditional basis that did not involve services being rendered in Hong Kong, the  right  would  accordingly  be  recognised  as  having  been  derived  from services  rendered  outside  Hong  Kong.    As  such,  the  gain  on  exercise  of  the right would not be chargeable to Salaries Tax.

## Example 6

The taxpayer had a non-Hong Kong employment.  All services were rendered in  Hong  Kong  during  the  year  of  assessment  in  which  the  right  was unconditionally granted, but during the year of assessment in which the right was  exercised,  the  taxpayer  rendered  all  services  in  connection  with  the employment outside Hong Kong.

52. As  the taxpayer rendered all services in connection with the employment in Hong Kong during the year of assessment in which the right was  granted,  and  as  it  was  granted  on  an  unconditional  basis  which  did  not involve  services  being  rendered  outside  Hong  Kong,  the  gain  on  exercise would be fully chargeable to Salaries Tax by virtue of section 8(1A)(a) (i.e. the gain  would  fall  within  the  words  'income  derived  from  services  rendered  in Hong Kong').  The timing of the exercise of the right would determine the year of  assessment  in  respect  of  which  the  gain  is  chargeable,  but  would  not otherwise  be  relevant.    The  chargeability  of  the  gain  depends  on  where  the person rendered the services from which the benefit, i.e. the right, was derived; not on where the taxpayer was rendering services at the time of the subsequent exercise  of  the  right.    Likewise,  if  the  taxpayer  had  ceased  the  employment prior  to  exercising  the  right,  it  would  not  have  any  bearing  on  the  issue  of chargeability.

## Example 7

The  taxpayer  had  a  non-Hong  Kong  employment.    Services  were  rendered inside and outside Hong Kong during the year of assessment in which the right was unconditionally granted and during the year in which it was exercised.

53. If  the  right  was  unconditionally  granted  to  the  taxpayer  before  he commenced to render any services for the employer concerned in Hong Kong, it  would be accepted that the right was not derived from services rendered in Hong Kong, and accordingly no part of the gain calculated under section 9(4) in respect of the exercise of the right would be chargeable to Salaries Tax.
54. If,  however,  the  right  was  unconditionally  granted  to  the  taxpayer after  he  had  commenced  to  render  services  in  Hong  Kong,  part  of  the  gain would  be  regarded  as  having  been  derived  from  services  rendered  in  Hong Kong.  In practice, in such a case, the right would be treated as having been derived from the services rendered during the course of the year of assessment in  which  it  was  granted.    Accordingly,  the  assessable  portion  would  be calculated  using  the  same  'time  basis'  ratio  applied  in  relation  to  the  other income derived by the person in the year of assessment of the grant.  The actual assessable  amount  would,  of  course,  also  depend  on  the  amount  of  the  gain calculated in accordance with section 9(4), and would be assessable in the year of  assessment  in  which  the  right  was  exercised.    The  fact  that  the  taxpayer rendered some services in Hong Kong during the year of assessment in which the right was exercised would not in itself have any bearing on whether the gain on exercise would be chargeable to Salaries Tax.

## Example 8

The taxpayer had a non-Hong Kong employment.  The right was conditionally granted  subject  to  the  completion  of  a  vesting  period  during  which  services were rendered partly inside and partly outside Hong Kong.

55. In  a  case  involving  a  non-Hong Kong employment, because of the terms of section 8(1A)(a), it is necessary to ascertain the extent to which the income (i.e. the gain on exercise) was derived from services rendered in Hong Kong.  The approach to use in such a case is explained in paragraphs 44 to 48

above.  The assessable portion, if any, would be chargeable to Salaries Tax in respect of the year of assessment in which the right was exercised.

## Changes  from  Hong  Kong  to  non-Hong  Kong  employment  or  vice  versa during vesting period

56. The  option  may  be  granted  at  the  time  when  the  taxpayer  holds  a Hong  Kong  employment  or  non-Hong  Kong  employment,  subject  to  the completion  of  a  vesting  period.    During  the  vesting  period,  the  taxpayer's source  of  employment  changes  from  a  Hong  Kong  to  a  non-Hong  Kong employment, or vice versa.  Given that the taxpayer holds both a Hong Kong and non-Hong Kong employment during the vesting period, the assessable gain of the option is apportioned between  the periods covered by the  two employments.

## Example 9

The taxpayer had a non-Hong Kong employment at the time when the option was conditionally granted subject to the completion of a vesting period during which the taxpayer's employment was changed to a Hong Kong employment within the same group of companies.

57. As the option was derived by the taxpayer from both the non-Hong Kong  employment  and  the  Hong  Kong  employment,  it  is  necessary  to apportion the share option gain, which can be done by simple time apportionment,  to  ascertain  the  amount  of  the  gain  attributable  to  each employment.  The portion attributable to the Hong Kong employment would be fully assessed or fully exempt in accordance with the principles and examples set out in paragraphs 36 to 42 above.  On the other hand, the portion of the gain attributable  to  the  non-Hong  Kong  employment  would  be  fully  exempt  or further apportioned to arrive at the amount attributable to services rendered in Hong Kong pursuant to the principles and examples set out in paragraphs 43 to 55 above.

## PART II -SHARE AWARD BENEFITS

## THE ASSESSMENT APPROACH

58. For purposes of this part of the Practice Note, the terms 'stock' and 'share' are used interchangeably and reference to 'share' includes 'stock' and vice versa.  Share-based remuneration schemes are becoming more common. There  is  no  dispute  that  shares  obtained  through  such  schemes  are  taxable perquisites forming part of a taxpayer's employment income.  While share or stock award plans vary in details, the points which need to be addressed are -

-  When does the perquisite accrue to the employee?
-  What  value  should  be  attached  to  the  perquisite  when  it  has accrued to the employee?

The  first  question  can  be  considered  in  the  light  of  section  11D(b)  of  the Ordinance, which provides that income accrues to a person when he becomes entitled to claim payment.  While this section uses the term 'entitled to claim payment', in the situation of share award, this phrase is taken to mean 'entitled to ownership of the shares'.  Section 11D(a) provides that income which has accrued  to  a  person  but  which  has  not  been  received  by  him  shall  not  be included in his assessable income until such time as he shall have received such income.    Further,  income  which  has  been  made  available  to  an  employee  to whom it has accrued or has been dealt with on his behalf or according to his directions,  will  be  regarded  as  received  by  him.    In  regard  to  the  second question,  the  fair  value  of  the  perquisite  at  the  time  of  accrual  should  be ascertained.

59. For salaries tax purposes, the time at which the shares accrue to the employee  can  be  determined  by  reference  to  the  terms  of  the  award  plan. Generally, there are two approaches in assessing such awards.  These are (1) 'Upfront', i.e. at the time when the employer makes an award of shares to the employee, and (2) 'Back End', i.e. when the shares are actually vested in the employee free of any conditions.  Which of these two approaches to be adopted will depend on when the employee is regarded as fully entitled to ownership of the shares.  In determining whether ownership of the shares has passed to the

employee, consideration will be given to whether the employee is entitled to the full economic benefit of the shares.

60. Experience  shows  that  the  terms  of  award  plans  in  most  cases  are complex and varied.  For purposes of this DIPN, it is not practicable to set out and  comment  on  every  kind  of  share  award  plans.    What  is  important  is  to follow  the  guidelines  consistently  in  determining  when  the  perquisite  has accrued to the employee.  The following are general guidelines -

## (1) 'Upfront' approach

Under this approach, the award is assessed to tax at the time of grant by the employer.  The award granted may or may not be subject to certain restrictions.  The most common restriction is a restriction to sell,  e.g.,  the  employee  is  not  allowed  to  sell  the  shares  awarded within a certain period of time.  Only at the expiry of the restriction period  would  the  employee  be  allowed  to  sell.    Other  than  this restriction, the employee's name would be entered in the shareholders'  register,  he  would  be  entitled  to  vote  in  general meetings,  receive  dividends,  pledge  the  shares  to  banks  for  loans, etc.  In short, he has all the rights of a normal shareholder, except the freedom to sell  during  the  restriction  period.    Most  importantly,  at the end of the restriction period, normally little needs to be done to 'vest' the shares in the employee.  In such situation, the Department takes the view that the employee has received a perquisite in the form of shares at the time of grant and he would be chargeable to tax at this point of time (i.e. upfront).

## (2) 'Back End' approach

Under this  approach,  certain  conditions  have  to  be  satisfied  before the shares are  vested  in  the  employees.    The  most  common conditions include completing a period of employment with the same employer/group, the company attaining certain level of financial or operational  results,  etc.    Before  fulfilment  of  these  conditions,  the shares are simply not vested in the employee.  The shares might be allotted and held by a trustee but they are liable to be forfeited if the conditions are not fulfilled, or in the event that the employee resigns or is dismissed due to misconduct, etc.  Normally, the employee does

not have rights of a shareholder, he is not registered as a shareholder, he is not allowed to vote or to receive dividend, etc.  It is only at the expiry  of  the  vesting  period  that  the  employee  would  receive  all shares  together  with  dividend  or  dividend  shares,  or  bonus  shares distributed during the vesting period. In this situation, the Department  takes  the  view  that  at  the  time  of  grant,  the  employee only receives a promise with respect to the shares.  It is only when the  shares  are  vested  in  the  employee  (or  when  the  employee  is entitled  to  ownership  of  the  shares)  free  of  any  restriction  that  the employee is taken as having received the perquisite.  It is then that the share award will be chargeable to tax (i.e. back end).

61. For  the  present  purpose,  'vesting'  refers  to  the  time  when  the employee  is  entitled  to  ownership  of  the  shares  free  of  all  conditions  and 'vesting period' is taken to mean the period from the date that the share award is  granted  to  an  employee  to  the  date  immediately  before  the  date  that  the employee  is  entitled  to ownership  of  the  shares  free  of all conditions. Generally  speaking,  if  shares  granted  are  subject  to  forfeiture  by  reason  of termination of employment or some future events, the 'Back End' approach is more appropriate in assessing the shares.  There is more certainty under this approach as the employee is entitled to the shares free of any condition.  No doubt,  there  must  be  many  factual  scenarios  more  complicated  than  those highlighted above.  It is more appropriate to examine the terms of the award to ascertain the point of time that the shares accrue to the employee for salaries tax purposes.  The following table summarizes the two broad approaches -

|                                              | 'Upfront' approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 'Back End' approach                                                                                                          |

| Time of assessment                           | Upfront, i.e. at the time of the grant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Back end, i.e. upon fulfilment of conditions.                                                                                |

| Discount in valuation?                       | Yes. The discount is to be determined in the light of the facts of each particular case. Generally, a 5% discount will be given for each year of sale restriction [see D120/02, IRBRD Vol. 18, 125 where a 25% discount was allowed for a 5 year restriction period]. This is in line with the treatment of share options under paragraph 21. | No.                                                                                                                          |
| Distributions (e.g. dividends, bonus shares) | Received during the restriction period: Not taxable; regarded as investment income since employee is entitled to the shares at the time of award.                                                                                                                                                                                             | Received during the vesting period: Taxable, since employee is entitled to the shares only at the end of the vesting period. |

## Hong Kong employment

62. The value of shares accruing in a year of assessment will be added to the taxpayer's other income for this year and be assessed to tax according to the general  charging  provisions.    If  the  taxpayer  does  not  render  any  services  in Hong Kong or if he renders some services, his visit in Hong Kong does not exceed 60 days for that year, the shares, along with the taxpayer's employment income, will be exempt from tax by applying sections 8(1A)(b)(ii) and 8(1B).

Shares vested after cessation of employment are deemed to accrue on the last day of employment.

## Example 10

On 1 May 2005, while the taxpayer was an employee of a group company in Hong Kong, he was granted 5,000 shares by his employer subject to a vesting period.  On 1 July 2006, he resigned from the company.  On 1 May 2007, the 5,000 shares vested in him.  The value of the vested shares was $A on 1 May 2007.

In  this  example,  the  value  of  the  vested  shares,  $A,  is  to  be  included  in  the taxpayer's assessment for 2006/07 according to section 11D(b) proviso (ii).

## Non-Hong Kong employment

63. If shares are subject to a vesting period, they are perquisite accruing to an employee in the year of assessment in which vesting takes place.  For an employee who is entitled to time basis apportionment, the value of the shares should be added to the employee's other taxable income for that year and the time apportionment factor relevant to that year be applied to ascertain income chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.  Except in commencement and cessation cases mentioned in paragraphs 66 and 67, the factor is to be determined as follows -

## Days in Hong Kong in the year of assessment that vesting takes place

Days in the year of assessment that vesting takes place

64. The factual situation between share award and share option is not the same.    Share  options  involving  vesting  periods  may  be  exercised  by  an employee  a  few  years  after  the  options  are  vested.    In  paragraph  45,  a  time apportionment factor by reference to the days-in-days-out in the vesting period is adopted for ascertaining the chargeable portion of the gain when the options are  exercised.    This  approach  is  not  suitable  for  share  award  cases.    If  it  is accepted that the perquisite accrues at the moment of time of vesting, it is only necessary to apply the time apportionment factor in the year of vesting, i.e. the year  that  the  perquisite  accrues  to  the  employee.    Section  8(1)  provides  that salaries tax shall be chargeable for each year of assessment in respect of income arising in or derived from Hong Kong from an office or employment.

In section 11B, the assessable income of a person in any year of assessment shall  be  the  aggregate  amount  of  income  accruing  to  him  in  that  year  of assessment.  Section 8(1A) which is an extension of section 8(1), provides that income  arising  or  derived  from  Hong  Kong  includes  income  derived  from services rendered in Hong Kong.  The approach to assess shares accruing in a year of assessment by reference to the time apportionment factor for that year is consistent with the aforementioned provisions.

## Continuous employment cases

65. In  a  continuous  employment  situation,  it  is  generally  true  that  the amount of time that an employee spends in Hong Kong and outside Hong Kong would be fairly constant comparing one year with the next.  It is not anticipated that  the  use  of  the  formula  in  paragraph  63  should  create  undue  unfairness. Exemptions  under  sections  8(1A)(b)(ii)  and  8(1B)  are  also  available  to  nonHong Kong employment cases.

## Example 11

The  taxpayer  had  a  non-Hong  Kong  employment.    On  1  May  2005,  he  was granted  10,000  shares  by  his  employer  subject  to  a  vesting  period.    Shares would  only  be  vested  on  condition  that  he  remained  an  employee  of  his company on the vesting dates.  5,000 shares vested in him on 1 May 2007 and the remaining 5,000 on 1 May 2008.  The number of days in Hong Kong and outside Hong Kong was ascertained as follows -

| Year ended   |   (A) Days In Hong Kong |   (B) Days outside Hong Kong |   (C) Total days |   % (A)/(C) |
|--------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|-------------|
| 31.3.2006    |                     275 |                           90 |              365 |          75 |
| 31.3.2007    |                     260 |                          105 |              365 |          71 |
| 31.3.2008    |                     250 |                          116 |              366 |          68 |
| 31.3.2009    |                     255 |                          110 |              365 |          70 |

In  the  above  example,  the  assessor  and  taxpayer  agreed  that  the  'back  end' approach is applicable to assess the vested shares.  The value of the first 5,000 vested shares is to be included along with the taxpayer's other remuneration in the year of assessment 2007/08 and 250/366 of the value is to be subject to tax

while  the  remaining  5,000  vested  shares  is  to  be  included  in  2008/09  and 255/365 of their value is subject to tax.

## Inbound employee cases

66. An employee holding a non-Hong Kong employment may have been granted shares before he takes up his employment or assignment in Hong Kong and such shares are subject to a vesting period.  If shares are vested in him after he takes up such employment or assignment and the terms of the share award clearly  state  that  the  vesting  of  the  shares  will  depend  on  a  period  of employment, the Department can agree to exclude a portion of the gain on time apportionment referable to the vesting period before the taxpayer's transfer to Hong Kong under the 'Back End' approach.  If it is not so clearly stated, the whole of the benefit should be included in the year of vesting.

## Example 12

On  1  September  2006,  while  the  taxpayer  was  an  employee  of  a  group company outside Hong Kong, he was granted 10,000 shares by his employer subject to a vesting period.  Shares would only be vested on condition that he remained an employee of the group on the vesting dates.  On 1 August 2007, he was  transferred  to  another  company  in  Hong  Kong  within  the  group.    The Department accepts that the taxpayer had a non-Hong Kong employment.

On 1 September 2007, 5,000 of the shares vested in him.  The vesting period for these shares totalled 365 days, i.e. 1.9.06 to 31.8.07.  The number of days in the vesting period after the taxpayer's transfer to Hong Kong was 31 days, i.e. 1.8.07 to 31.8.07 for the first 5,000 shares.

On 1 September 2008, the remaining 5,000 shares vested.  The vesting period for these shares totalled 731 days, i.e. 1.9.06 to 31.8.08.  The number of days in the vesting period after the taxpayer's transfer to Hong Kong was 397 days, i.e. 1.8.07 to 31.8.08, for these remaining 5,000 shares.

The number of days in Hong Kong and outside Hong Kong was ascertained as follows -

| Period/               | (A) Days In Hong   | (B) Days outside Hong Kong   | (C) Total days   | % (A)/(C)   |
|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Year ended            | Kong               |                              |                  |             |
| 1.8.2007 to 31.3.2008 | 166                | 78                           | 244              | 68          |
| 31.3.2009             | 255                | 110                          | 365              | 70          |

In this example, the assessor and taxpayer agreed that the 'back end' approach is  applicable  to  assess  the  vested  shares.  Assuming  the  value  of  the  vested shares on 31 August 2007 was $A and those on 31 August 2008 was $B, the amounts to be included in the assessments would be calculated as -

Year of assessment 2007/08: $A x (31/365) x (166/244)

Year of assessment 2008/09: $B x (397/731) x (255/365)

## Outbound employee cases

67. Similarly, shares may have been granted to the employee holding a non-Hong Kong employment during the time of his employment or assignment in Hong Kong but such shares, which are subject to a vesting period, are vested in him after his transfer outside Hong Kong to another group company.  If the 'Back End' approach is applicable and if the terms of the award clearly state that the vesting of the shares will depend on a period of employment, the value of the shares attributable to the vesting period before his transfer outside Hong Kong should be chargeable to tax.  However, there may be situations in which a  taxpayer's  entitlement  to  receive  the  vested  shares  is  not  affected  by  his resignation.  In other words, if the taxpayer will still receive shares under the award after his resignation, the value of the shares should be included in the year of resignation, see Example 10 above.

## Example 13

The taxpayer had a non-Hong Kong employment.  On 1 October 2005, while the  taxpayer  was  an  employee  of  a  group  company  in  Hong  Kong,  he  was granted  5,000  shares  by  his  employer  subject  to  a  vesting  period.    Shares would only be vested on condition that he remained an employee of the group on  the  vesting  date.    On  1  July  2007,  he  was  transferred  to  another company outside Hong Kong within the group.

On 1 October 2007, the 5,000 shares vested in him.  The vesting period for these shares totalled 730 days, i.e. 1.10.05 to 30.9.07.  The number of days in the vesting period before the taxpayer's transfer outside Hong Kong was 638 days, i.e. 1.10.05 to 30.6.07 for the 5,000 shares.

| Period                |   (A) Days In Hong Kong |   (B) Days outside Hong Kong |   (C) Total days |   % (A)/(C) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|-------------|
| 1.4.2007 to 30.6.2007 |                      65 |                           26 |               91 |          71 |

The assessor and taxpayer agreed that the 'Back End' approach is applicable to assess the vested shares. Assuming the value of the vested shares on 1 October 2007 was $A, the amount to be included in the assessment for the year 2007/08 is to be calculated as -

Year of assessment 2007/08: $A x (638/730) x (65/91)

## 'Phantom share plans'

68. Some employers may set up incentive schemes involving 'phantom or  hypothetical  shares'.    Under  such  schemes,  the  employee  is  'allocated'  a number of shares in the employer company or group company.  The employee receives  a  future  cash  bonus  linked  to  the  value  of  such  shares.    No  tax  is chargeable at the time when the phantom shares are allocated if no actual value passes to the employee.  When bonus is paid by the employer, it will be taxed together with his other income in the year of payment.

## Method of valuation

69. The Department assesses the shares according to their market value if  they  are  listed  shares.    There  should  not  be  great  difficulty  getting  their quotation from the stock exchange.  If the shares are unlisted, the Department needs  to  employ  other  methods,  e.g.  net  assets  value.    Generally,  the  same methods of valuation as advocated in paragraphs 22 to 26 would apply.

## PART III - ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS

## PERSONS DEPARTING PERMANENTLY FROM HONG KONG

## Share option benefits

70. It will be appreciated from what is said in Part I that a gain realized from  the  exercise,  assignment  or  release  of  a  share  option  after  permanent departure  from  Hong  Kong  might  nonetheless  be  chargeable  to  salaries  tax. However, with a view to finalising the salaries tax liabilities of such persons prior to departure, the Department will, as a concession, allow a person to elect to have the liability ascertained on the basis of a notional exercise of the option. More particularly, the Department will accept that the liability, if any, can be finalized on the basis of the gain (calculated in accordance with section 9(4)(a)) that would have been realized if the option had been exercised on a day within 7  days  before  the  date  of  submission  of  the  person's  tax  return  for  the  final assessment applicable to the year of assessment in which he or she permanently departs from Hong Kong.  It should be noted that if the person concerned has a non-Hong Kong employment and the option in question is a conditional one in respect of which the vesting period has not expired on the date of the notional exercise, the gain should nonetheless be calculated on the basis that the vesting period would be deemed to end on that date.

71. If  a  person  wishes to make such an election, an election form cum computation of gain statement per the Appendix 1 should be attached to the return to the effect that the gain is offered for assessment on the understanding that  no  further  liability  will  arise  when  the  option  is  actually  exercised, assigned  or  released  (i.e.  after  departure  from  Hong  Kong).    The  election should  be  made  in  respect  of  all  grants  received  but  not  exercised  prior  to cessation of employment for Hong Kong salaries tax purposes and/or departure from Hong Kong.  Election relating to some of the grants or only part of a grant is not accepted.
72. As  a  further  concession,  the  Department  is  prepared  to  accept  an election  made  within  3  months  from  the  date  of  permanent  departure  from Hong Kong if it has not been made before departure.  In this kind of situation, the  date  of  departure  will  be  taken  as  the  date  of  the  notional  exercise  for purposes of calculating the gain.

73. An  election  once  made  cannot  be  withdrawn  before  the  actual exercise,  assignment  or  release,  except  (i)  within  the  objection  period  of  the assessment in which the gain of the notional exercise is included, or (ii) total forfeiture of the options with no replacement or compensation before the actual exercise.  On the other hand, if it transpires that the gain in respect of the actual exercise, assignment or release is less than the amount assessed in respect of the notional exercise, the Department will favourably consider any application for appropriate amendment and re-assessment.

## Share award benefits

74. With  regard  to  share  awards  granted  but  not  yet  vested  in  the employee, and where the 'Back End' approach is applicable, the Department agrees to adopt the same practice as set out under paragraphs 70 and 72 above to  facilitate  early  finalization  of  the  taxpayer's  tax  liability  before  his permanent  departure.    A  person  may  elect  to  be  assessed  on  either  (a)  the deemed value on a day within 7 days before the submission of his return for the final assessment applicable to the year of assessment in which he permanently departs Hong Kong if election is made before his departure from Hong Kong, or  (b)  the  deemed  value  on  the  date  of  his  departure  if  his  election  is  made within  3  months  from  the  date  of  permanent  departure  from  Hong  Kong. Election  can  be  made  by  completing Appendix  2 .    An  election  once  made cannot  be  withdrawn.    Such  election  is  only  accepted  if  it  applies  to  all unvested  shares  chargeable  to  tax  according  to  this  Practice  Note.    Once  an election is accepted by the Department and an assessment is made according to this  paragraph,  a  subsequent  request  to  revise  the  assessment  will  not  be entertained  unless  the  assessment  is  objected  to  within  the  statutory  time allowed  for  objection.    On  the  other  hand,  the  Department  will  not  seek  to increase  the  assessment  for  the  sole  reason  that  the  value  upon  vesting  has increased if the assessment is raised according to this paragraph.

## REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

## Employees

75. Where,  by  virtue  of  section  9(1)(d)  and  the  related  provisions referred  to  above,  a  person  is  chargeable  to  salaries  tax  in  respect  of  a  gain realized by the exercise, assignment or release of a right to acquire shares or

stock in a corporation or in respect of shares awarded to him by reason of his office  or  employment, the person is obliged to inform the Department of the fact under section 51(2).  Just as chargeability does not depend on the person being employed at the time of exercise, assignment or release of share options or at the time when shares are vested in him, the person has an obligation to inform the Department should such events take place.  The only exception is where a person has elected for a notional exercise of the options as set out in paragraphs  70  to  73  above.    If  all  tax  liability  has  been  settled  through  a notional  exercise,  the  person  is  not  required  to  inform  the  Department  at  the time of actual exercise.  Or if all tax liability has been settled through 'deemed vesting' of otherwise unvested shares before permanent departure mentioned in paragraph 74 above, the person is not required to inform the Department when the shares are vested.

76. The requirement to inform the Department can generally be satisfied when the person submits his or her 'Tax Return - Individuals' (B.I.R.60) for the year of assessment in which the right is exercised, etc. or share awarded or vested.    Details  of  the  necessary  particulars  are  listed  in  Guide  Book  issued with each such return.  After taxpayers have departed from Hong Kong, they may still have chargeable income through exercising options granted to them during their employment in Hong Kong or through shares vested in them which are granted to them because of their office or employment in Hong Kong.  For these taxpayers, 'Tax Return - Individuals' may no longer be sent to them in the annual bulk issue of returns.  Nevertheless, these taxpayers are still required to advise the Department by way of a letter when there is chargeable income.
77. The obligation to inform the Department does not, however, depend on  a  tax  return  being  issued  to  the  person.    Section  51(2)  of  the  Ordinance provides that where a person chargeable to salaries tax has not been required by an  assessor  to  furnish  a  return,  he  is  nonetheless  required  to  inform  the Commissioner that he is so chargeable not later than 4 months after the end of the  basis  period  for  the  year  of  assessment  concerned.    In  the  case  of  share option,  the  time  is  not  later  than  4  months  after  the  end  of  the  year  of assessment in which the option is exercised.  In the case of share award, the basis period should be that for the year of assessment in which he is entitled to ownership  of  the  shares.    If  vesting  of  the  shares  takes  place  after  his employment has ceased, the taxpayer should advise the Department as soon as he is entitled to ownership of the shares unconditionally.

78. As  with any other income  that is chargeable to tax, serious consequences  may  follow  if  a  person  fails  to  meet  his  obligations  under  the Ordinance  in  respect  of  any  chargeable  gain  arising  from  the  exercise, assignment or release of a right to acquire shares or stock or arising from share awarded.  In this  regard  it  is  worth  noting  that  the  penalty  provisions  of  the Ordinance may apply where a person fails to notify the Commissioner that he is  chargeable  to  tax,  fails  to  comply  with  a  notice  to  submit  a  return,  or makes an incorrect return by omitting or understating anything.  In such cases, depending on the nature of the shortcoming, prosecution action may be taken or additional tax imposed (see sections 80, 82 and 82A of the Ordinance).  The Ordinance also provides for various recovery measures to be adopted, depending on the circumstances, where a person has failed to pay tax which is due and payable or if it appears likely that this will happen -

-  section  75  provides  for  recovery  action  in  the  District  Court where a person defaults in the payment of tax;
-  section 76 for recovery from debtors of the taxpayer and certain other  parties  where  tax  payable  is  in  default,  or  the  person concerned  has  left  Hong  Kong  or  in  the  opinion  of  the Commissioner is likely to leave Hong Kong without paying the tax; and
-  section 77 for the Commissioner to seek a Departure Prevention Order from a District Court Judge where a person has not paid all  the  tax  assessed  and  there  are  reasonable  grounds  for believing that the person intends to depart, or has departed, from Hong Kong to reside elsewhere.

## Employers

79. Employers  are  required  to  provide  information  in  respect  of  share option benefits received by employees.  Section 52(4) provides that where an employer commences to employ in Hong Kong an individual who is or is likely to be chargeable to salaries tax, the employer must within three months of the date  of  commencement  of  such  employment  notify  the  Commissioner  in writing  of,  amongst  other  things,  the  individual's  terms  of  employment. Accordingly, if the terms of employment provide for participation in a share

option scheme, full details of how the scheme operates should be supplied to the Commissioner.  Details should also be provided if an employee has been granted a share option prior to commencing to be employed in Hong Kong but not yet exercised by him.  The option may be not fully vested and may only become vested and exercisable after rendering services in Hong Kong, or the option  may  be  fully  vested  but  granted  as  an  inducement  to  take  up employment in Hong Kong.  In both of these situations, the subsequent gains realized by the exercise, assignment or release of the options are income from office or employment under section 9(1)(d).  Details thus need to be provided. Particulars should include the number and type of shares covered by the option, the  consideration  (if  any)  paid  for  the  grant  of  the  option,  the  consideration required to exercise the option and the period within which the option must be exercised.  The information may, if the employer wishes, be provided in either case as an attachment to a form I.R.56E (the standard form available from the Department which an employer may use to comply with notification requirements under section 52(4)).

80. It is also relevant that employers are generally issued with a notice each year, under section 52(2) of the Ordinance, which requires the submission of returns  detailing  the  remuneration  of  employees  (i.e.  forms  B.I.R.56A  and I.R.56B).    The  notes  accompanying  the  forms  set  out  the  nature  of  the information  required  in  respect  of  rights  to  acquire  shares  that  have  been granted,  exercised,  assigned  or  released.    Employers  should  be  aware  when completing these forms that, in effect, the information is called for where a gain calculated in accordance with section 9(4) of the Ordinance has been realized during the year of assessment covered by the return in respect of a right granted 'at any time'.  In other words, the information should be supplied if such a gain was realized during the year, irrespective of whether the person concerned was a current or former employee at the time of exercise.  However, in the case of a former employee, no information need be provided to the Commissioner where the gain realized was less than the basic allowance for the relevant year and  it  is  known  that  during  the  relevant  year  the  person  concerned  did  not derive any other income chargeable to salaries tax (e.g. where the person was employed by another company in the same group and worked wholly outside Hong Kong throughout the year).

81. Particulars  of  gains  realized  under  share  option  schemes  are  also requested  on  forms  I.R.56F  and  I.R.56G  which,  respectively,  may  be completed by an employer to comply with requirements under section 52(5), to notify the Commissioner where an employee is about to cease to be employed, and section 52(6), to notify the Commissioner when an employee is about to depart from Hong Kong.
82. Where an employer is required to report details in respect of a gain realized by the exercise etc. of a share option, the gain should be calculated in accordance with section 9(4) of the Ordinance and reported accordingly.  The employer should not make an apportionment of the gain for reporting in the employer's return even if the employee (or former employee) might be entitled to  time-basis  apportionment  of  his/her  income  by  virtue  of  section  8(1A)(a). Details of the calculation of any such apportionment should only be included in the tax return of the individual concerned.
83. With regard to share awards, the employer's obligations are similar. Employers are required to report share award benefits in I.R.56E in commencement cases, I.R.56Bs in continuous employment cases, I.R.56Fs and I.R.56Gs in cessation and departure from Hong Kong cases.  If share awards are vested in the employee after cessation of employment, an amendment to the I.R.56 forms previously filed should be made by either filing a 'Replacement' or a written notification of amendment.  For details, see -

www.ird.gov.hk/eng/tax/ere\_amd.htm.

## LIQUIDITY AND TAX LIABILITY

84. The  Department  does  not  consider  that  there is unfairness in demanding a taxpayer to pay tax on share awards before he can sell the shares for cash.  That said, the Collector is always prepared to assist if any taxpayer has a liquidity problem.  Instalment payments could be granted in appropriate cases.

## APPLICATION OF SECTIONS 61, 61A, 70 AND 70A

85. The Department will  generally  act  in  accordance  with  the  Practice Note  in  relation to assessments  raised  after its issue  and  to  objections concerning  relevant  gains  that  are  subsequently  finalized.    Exceptionally,  a different  basis  of  assessment  may  be  used  in  any  particular  case  if  it  is considered that section 61 or section 61A of the Ordinance should be applied. In such circumstances, the assessment may be made either on the basis that the relevant scheme or any part of it had not been entered into, or in such other manner as  is  considered  appropriate  to  counteract  the  tax  benefit  that  would otherwise be obtained.  It should also be noted that where an assessment made prior to the issue of this Practice Note was regarded as final and conclusive in terms of section 70 of the Ordinance, it will not be reopened for the purpose of making an adjustment to reflect any change of practice detailed in the Practice Note.
