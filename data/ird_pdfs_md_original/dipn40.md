## INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this Practice Note is to outline the views of the Inland Revenue  Department  ('the  Department')  in  relation  to  the  treatment  of 'prepaid or deferred revenue expenses (prepayments)' i.e. cash disbursement or incurrence of liabilities which is in the nature of revenue expenditure in a particular  year,  but  in  accordance  with  the  accounting  concept  of  matching revenue with expenditure is carried forward and charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which the related profits are received (e.g. prepayments of  rent,  rate,  insurance  premium  and  interest).    In  the  first  instance,  such expenditure is typically debited to a current asset account in the balance sheet of  the  business  as  deferred  expenditure,  and  then  amortised  in  subsequent periods by  charging  to the profit and  loss  account  the  amount  of  the expenditure  that  relates  to  each  such  period. The  Department's  position  in relation  to  such  prepayments  has  recently  been  reviewed  in  the  light  of  the decision of the Court of Final Appeal in the case of Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Secan Limited &amp; Ranon Limited 5 HKTC 266 (' Secan ').

## POSITION PRIOR TO SECAN

2. Prior to Secan , the Department generally accepted that if an expense would  typically  have  been  paid  in  advance  (e.g.  car  licence  fee,  insurance premium  and  subscription  fee),  the  prepayment  should  be  allowed  as  a deduction  on  the  basis  that  the  expense  had  been  incurred.    Obviously, enquiries  would  usually  have  been  made  if  the  expense  involved  would  not normally have been due for payment in advance and the period was significant. If it was concluded in such a case that an avoidance arrangement was involved, a  deduction  would  have  been  denied.    The  Department's  position  in  this regard remains unchanged.

## THE SECAN CASE

3. The  decision  in  the  case  was  handed  down  by  the  Court  of  Final Appeal on 8 December 2000. The central  question  was  whether  the  Inland Revenue Ordinance prohibited the capitalisation of interest for the purpose of computing a taxpayer's assessable profits and allowable losses. The company

concerned was involved in the business of property development.    During a number of years (1988 to 1990) whilst a property was under development it incurred  substantial  interest  charges. The  company  capitalised  the  interest charges by treating them as part of the cost of development in the same way as it  treated  the  cost  of  the  site  and  the  construction  costs.    The  amounts capitalised were carried to the company's balance sheets by adding them to the value  of  property  under  development. For  these  years  the  profit  and  loss accounts of the company contained no entries for the costs of development and interest charges incurred.

4. In 1991 the company began to sell completed flats in Phase I of the development  project. In  this  year  it  sought  to  set  the  whole  of  the  interest charges for the earlier years as well as the interest charge in the current year against  the  proceeds  of  sales  made  in  the  current  year.    The  taxpayer contended that by failing to deduct interest charges for the earlier years in the years in which they were incurred, its tax computations understated the loss in each of those years. In other words, the taxpayer argued, insofar as the claim related to interest incurred in earlier years, the claim should be understood not as  a  claim  to  deduct  interest  but  as  a  claim  to  carry  forward  the  understated losses of those years and set them against the profits of the current year.
5. The Commissioner's response was to the effect that the taxpayer's computations  and  financial  statements  for  the  first  three  years,  which  were agreed to show a true and fair view of the taxpayer's affairs, were correct; the Ordinance did not prohibit  the  capitalisation  of  interest;  and  the  interest  was deducted  in  each  of  the  years  in  which  it  was  incurred  but,  because  it  was capitalised,  the  deductions  did  not  give  rise  to  any  losses  capable  of  being carried forward.
6. To put the matter briefly, the Court agreed with the Commissioner's position  in  relation  to  the  case  under  consideration. The  importance  of  the decision, however,  lies in its wider ramifications. Secan was  directly concerned  with  a  trading  stock  issue,  i.e.  when  and  how  interest  capitalised whilst  the  trading  stock  was  work  in  progress  would  qualify  for  deduction. The terms of the decision, however, are such that they provide guidance as to the appropriate treatment of other categories of expenditure, including expenditures  on  prepayments.    And  in  the  latter  regard,  it  has  now  been concluded,  following  consultation  with  the  Department  of  Justice,  that  the Department should revise its practice.

## REVISED PRACTICE

7. In  essence  the  Department's  revised  position  in  relation  to  prepaid revenue expenses (i.e. those which are amortised or charged against profits in a subsequent  period  or  periods)  is  that  the  tax  treatment  should  follow  the accounting  treatment  of  such  expenses,  provided  that  the  treatment  in  the accounts is in accordance with the prevailing generally accepted principles of commercial accounting and is not inconsistent with any provision in the Inland Revenue  Ordinance.    In  other  words,  it  will  not  be  accepted  that  any deduction can be claimed in a taxpayer's Profits Tax computation in respect of the whole amount (rather than the portion amortised) which, although incurred in the basis period under consideration, has not in effect been charged against the taxpayer's accounting profits for that period, because it relates to a future period  or  periods  (e.g.  where  the  amount  has  been  debited  to  a  current  asset account in the balance sheet of the business, with the intention that it will be amortised in subsequent periods by charging to the profit and loss account the part of the expenditure that relates to each such period).

## REASONS FOR THE CHANGE

8. As  was  indicated  in  the  introduction,  it  was  previously  common practice  to  allow  a  deduction  by  way  of  a  computational  adjustment  for  the whole  amount  of  a  prepaid  expense  in  the  year  it  was  incurred. The underlying  rationale  was  that  expenditure  on  a  prepayment  qualified  for deduction under section 16 of the Ordinance as (having been paid) it had been 'incurred' and had not otherwise been deducted (as it was not charged to the taxpayer's  profit  and  loss  account) . Secan indicates  that  this  approach  was misguided in several respects.
9. The Secan decision  made  it  clear  that  assessable  profits  must  be ascertained in accordance with the ordinary principles of commercial accounting,  as  modified  to  conform  with  the  Ordinance. As  was  stated  by Lord Millett NPJ, who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court, at page 330 -
3. 'Where  the  taxpayer's  financial  statements  are  correctly  drawn  in accordance  with  the  ordinary  principles  of  commercial  accounting

and in conformity with the Ordinance, no further modifications are required or permitted.'

10. It  is  also  pertinent  to  refer  to  the  following  observations  of  Lord Millett concerning the purpose of section 16 (at page 331) -
2. '…  But  the  profits  of  a  business  cannot  be  ascertained  without deducting the expenses and outgoings incurred in making them, and the section is not needed to authorise them to be deducted. Sections 16 and 17 (which disallows certain deductions) are enacted for the protection  of  the  revenue,  not  the  taxpayer,  and  in  my  opinion section 16 is to be read in a negative sense. It permits outgoings to be  deducted only to  the  extent  to  which  they  are  incurred  in  the relevant year. In this respect there is no difference between the law of  Hong  Kong  and  the  law  of  England.    In  both  jurisdictions expenses and outgoings are deductible in the year in which they are incurred and not otherwise.'
11. On the basis that section 16 should be read in a negative sense and is for  the  protection  of  the  revenue,  it  must  follow  that  the  section  cannot  be called  upon  by  a  taxpayer  to  justify  a  deduction  in  respect  of  any  item  of expenditure  where  accounts  have  been  correctly  prepared;  rather  it  serves  to sanction the disallowance of a deduction claim where the criteria in the section are not satisfied.
12. Lord Millett's affirmation that, in so far as 'incurrence' of expenditure  is  concerned,  the  position  in  Hong  Kong  is  the  same  as  that  in England is noteworthy. In other words, it is proper for Hong Kong to apply the relevant UK  authorities on the timing of deductibility of revenue expenditures.    One  such  relevant  authority  on  this  subject  is Gallagher  v Jones [1993] STC 537 , one of the authorities cited in Secan . [The court also considered at the same time the case of Threlfall v Jones (Inspector of Taxes) , which  raised  identical  issues  of  law.] One  of  the  issues  in  that  case  was whether, reflecting the accounts of the taxpayer,  the  whole  amount  of expenditure  incurred  by  way  of  rental  payments  was  deductible  in  the accounting period in which it was incurred, notwithstanding that the expenditure might be for the purpose of securing future benefits. In essence, the position of the Inspector of Taxes was that the loss relief of the taxpayer

should be computed on the basis that the amounts in question should be spread over a longer period.    Uncontradicted evidence was given in the course of the case  to  the  effect  that  the  accounts  were  not  in  accordance  with  relevant accounting standards and that they gave a completely misleading picture of the trading  results,  in  that  they  had  the  effect  of  anticipating  losses.    On  appeal from  the  decision  of  the  Special  Commissioner  in  favour  of  the  Revenue, Harman J found for the taxpayer.    He referred to the decisions of the House of Lords in Vallambrosa Rubber Co Ltd v Farmer ( Surveyor of Taxes ) (1910) 5 TC 529 and Ostime (Inspector of Taxes) v Duple Motor Bodies Ltd 39 TC 537 , and in his concluding summary, said ([1993] STC 199 at 216-217) -

'In  the  result,  it  seems  to  me  that  because  of  the  principle  I  see established by the House unanimously and in clear words in Duple Motor Bodies actual  expenditure  properly  incurred  and  referable  to the trade is properly chargeable in the accounts for the year in which it  falls  due  notwithstanding  that  prudent  and  proper  principles  of commercial accounting would draw the commercial accounts of the trading enterprise on a different basis and would spread forward the actual  expenditure  incurred  over  future  years  so  as  to  give  a  more balanced view of the nature of the success or failure of the trade.'

13. In  essence,  this  conclusion  was  consistent  with  the  basis  on  which prepayments were previously allowed as deductions in Hong Kong.    However, the  decision  of  Harman  J  did  not  prevail. On  appeal,  the  Court  of  Appeal found  for  the  Revenue. Sir  Thomas  Bingham  MR,  with  whom  the  other members of the Court agreed, rejected Harman J's interpretation of the Duple Motors decision. At page 553, he said -

'The issue in Duple Motors was, as it seems to me, far removed from that in the present case. The question was not whether expenditure should be charged during the year when it is incurred but whether one of two acceptable accountancy principles should be preferred to the other, which the taxpayer company had consistently adopted. do  not  question  the  correctness  of  the  decision;  but  I  do  not,  with respect, think that for present purposes it will bear the weight which Harman J gave to it.' I

He went on to conclude, at page 555 -

'The object is to determine, as accurately as possible, the profits or losses  of  the  taxpayers'  businesses  for  the  accounting  periods  in question. Subject to any express or implied statutory rule, of which there is none here, the ordinary way to ascertain the profits or losses of a business is to apply accepted principles of commercial accountancy. That is the very purpose for which such principles are formulated.

The authorities do not persuade me that there is any rule of law such as  that  for  which  the  taxpayer  contended  and  the  judge  found. Indeed, given the plain language of the legislation, I find it hard to understand how any judge-made rule could override the application of  a  generally  accepted  rule  of  commercial  accountancy  which  (a) applied to the situation in question, (b) was not one of two or more rules applicable to the situation in question and (c) was not shown to be inconsistent with the true facts or otherwise inapt to determine the true profits or losses of the business.'

14. The decision in the Gallagher case is clearly consistent with the view that  the  taxation  treatment  of  prepayments  should  follow  the  recognised accounting  treatment. This  is  reflected  in  the  following  extract  from  the Inspectors Manual of the United Kingdom's Inland Revenue -
2. 'A  deduction  may  also  be  sought  for  expenditure  charged  to  a current asset account in the balance sheet, such as 'prepayments' or 'deferred expenditure'.    In  such a case  it  is  very  doubtful  whether the taxpayer can point to any general tax principle which overrides the accounting treatment. In particular, the case of Threlfall v Jones (66  TC  77) is  authority  for  the  view  that  there  is  no  general  tax principle  to  the  effect  that  a  deduction  is  available  for  revenue expenditure  when  it  is  incurred  or  paid.    It  is  extremely  unlikely therefore that a deduction can be obtained for the expenditure prior to the period in which it is charged against profits in the accounts.

This  imposes  a  discipline  for  Case  I  purposes  which  is  a  very important feature of the way we compute taxable trading profit. As

- a  general  rule  it  is  not  possible  for  the  trader  to  take  a  more conservative view for tax than he does for other purposes. So, if a company wishes to reduce its taxable profit it has to tell creditors, shareholders and the stock market the same story.'
15. It can be seen that the decision in Gallagher v Jones provides for a more liberal construction of the term 'incurred', i.e. revenue expenditure can be  spread  over  the  accounts  of  more  than  one  period  for  tax  purposes. In essence, a prepayment can be regarded as incurred in a particular accounting period  to  the  extent  that  it  is  amortised  or  expensed  to  the  profit  and  loss account  for  that  period,  provided  that  the  treatment  is  in  accordance  with generally accepted accounting practice.

## SUBSEQUENT YEARS

16. Under the revised practice (see paragraph 7 above), the Department will  also  apply  taxation  treatment  in  accordance  with  established  accounting principles in the subsequent year or years when the prepayments are effectively charged against profits as expenses with the passage of time, usage or event. Such a practice is consistent with Lord Millett's affirmation that the position in Hong  Kong  is  no  different  from  that  in  the  UK  in  terms  of  deductions  and outgoings  only  being  deductible  in  the  year  in  which  they  are  incurred  (see paragraph 10 above) and also with the decision  in Gallagher ,  which  we  can turn  to  for  guidance  on  the  timing  of  revenue  expenditure  deductions  (see paragraph 12 above).
17. Guidance  may  also  be  obtained  from  the  decision  of  the  Privy Council in the case of Lo &amp; Lo v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 2 HKTC 34 , concerning the deductibility of a provision for staff retirement benefits. The decision confirmed that an amount does not have to be actually paid or even due and payable in a particular year for it to be deductible in that year. The following extract from the judgment of Lord Brightman, delivering the opinion of the Board, is again authority for recognising that deductions can be allowed for taxation purposes on the basis of the applicable accounting treatment -

'It  is  perfectly  correct  to  say  that  sections  16  and  17  provide exhaustively  for  the  deductions  which  are  permissible  to  be  made,

but  not  in  the  sense  that  permitted  deductions  are  confined  to  the particular matters specified in paragraphs (a) to (h) of section 16(1). Sections 16 and 17 provide exhaustively for deductions in the sense that  permitted  deductions  are  confined  to  outgoings  and  expenses incurred  in  the  production  of  profits  in  respect  of  which  tax  is chargeable; that  such  permitted  deductions  expressly  exclude  those in  section  17. In  the  opinion  of  their  Lordships  commercial considerations are not wholly to be disregarded in the course of this  process. They are  relevant  for  the  purpose  of  deciding  what can properly treated as 'outgoings and expenses … incurred during the basis period … in the production of profits in respect of which' the taxpayer is chargeable to tax.' [Emphasis added]

## WHICH COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS APPLY?

18. The basic position of the Department, under the revised practice, is that the taxation treatment of a prepayment should be in accordance with the manner  in  which  the  prepayment  is  required  to  be  treated  for  accounting purposes  under  the  relevant  financial  reporting  standards  prescribed  by  the Hong  Kong  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants  ('HKICPA'). In circumstances where a taxpayer is given a choice under those standards as to how  a  prepayment  should  be  treated,  the  taxation  treatment  is  to  reflect  the choice adopted, provided that it is not inconsistent with any provision of the Ordinance. In this regard, the following statement of Lord Millett in Secan, at page 330, is considered to be relevant -

'Where the taxpayer may properly draw its financial statements on either of two alternative bases, the Commissioner is both entitled and bound  to  ascertain  the  assessable  profits  on  whichever  basis  the taxpayer has chosen to adopt. He is bound to do so because he has no  power  to  alter  the  basis  on  which  the  taxpayer  has  drawn  its financial statements unless it is inconsistent with a provision of the Ordinance. But he is also entitled to do so, with the result that the taxpayer is effectively bound by its own choice, not because of any estoppel, but because it is the Commissioner's function to make the assessment and for the taxpayer to show that it is wrong.'

## Foreign corporations

19. Whilst  the  Department's  position  is  that  strictly  speaking  financial statements  should  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  financial  reporting standards  prescribed  by  the  HKICPA,  it  is  recognised  that  the  accounts  of companies  incorporated  outside  Hong  Kong  (and  the  branches  of  such companies) which are carrying on business in Hong Kong may be prepared on the basis of standards which vary from those in Hong Kong. In such a case, in so  far  as  any  prepayment  is  affected,  the  Department  will  generally  accept accounting  treatment  which  is:  (i)  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  financial reporting  standard  of  the  'home'  jurisdiction  or  International  Accounting  / Financial Reporting Standards (i.e. those standards issued by the International Accounting  Standards  Board);  and  (ii)  consistent  with  the  true  facts  or otherwise  apt  to  determine  the  true  profits  or  losses  of  the  business. It  is emphasized  that  although  the  financial  reporting  standards  of  the  home jurisdiction  may  be  accepted  under  the  above-mentioned  circumstances,  the accounting profits or losses would have to be adjusted in accordance with the provisions  of  the  Ordinance  and  the  established  taxation  principles. If  the home jurisdiction does not have any applicable financial reporting standard, an adjustment  of  the  accounting  profits  should  be  made  in  the  Profits  Tax computation  to  reflect  the  manner  in  which  the  financial  reporting  standards prescribed by the HKICPA would have applied to the prepayment. Incidents of varying standards should be of rare occurrence, as the accounting treatment of  prepayments  is  in  accordance  with  the  universal  fundamental  concepts  of 'accrual' and 'prudence'.

## APPLICATION

20. The revised practice will be applied by the Department in relation to any  prepayment  that  is  made  during  the  basis  period  of  a  taxpayer  for  the 2002/2003 year of assessment and subsequent years.    Accordingly, taxpayers and their representatives are advised that in preparing Profits Tax returns for these  years  of  assessment,  the  revised  practice  explained  above  should  be adopted.
21. Where a deduction has in effect been allowed in an earlier year of assessment (i.e. prior to 2002/2003) for a prepayment (or part of a prepayment)

in accordance with the 'old' practice, it will not be accepted that any further deduction  can  subsequently  be  allowed  in  respect  of  the  same  amount  in 2002/2003 or any subsequent year of assessment. Clearly, if the Department were not to take this approach, such amounts would in effect be deducted twice.
