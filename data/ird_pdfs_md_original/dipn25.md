## INTRODUCTION

## Background

In  the  1994-95  Budget  Speech,  the  Financial  Secretary  announced that steps would be taken to deal with tax avoidance aspects of certain 'service company'  arrangements.    Two  types  of  arrangements  were  identified  as constituting a significant and increasing risk to the public revenue. The first category  was  referred  to  as  arrangements  to  disguise  employer/employee relationships  (Type  I  cases),  and  the  second  as  arrangements  involving  the payment of inflated management fees (Type II cases). Following consultation, it  was  concluded  that  legislation  was  required  to  address  tax  avoidance involving Type I cases. This led to the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance  1995  ('the  Amendment  Ordinance')  at  Appendix  A,  which  was enacted  on  6  July  1995  and  came  into  operation  on  18  August  1995  (the 'appointed day').

2. The Amendment Ordinance amended the Inland Revenue Ordinance ('the  Ordinance')  by  adding  the  provisions  in  section  9A  to  counteract arrangements  made  to  avoid  salaries  tax  by  the  use  of  service  companies 1 . The effect is that remuneration paid to such a company for the services of the individual who or whose associate controls it will be treated as being income derived by that individual from an employment of profit.
3. At the same time, Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 24 was published to explain how the Department would deal with Type II cases,  and  sought  to  discourage  avoidance  arrangements  by  explaining  the circumstances under which deduction of management fees would be restricted.

## The principle

4. It  is  a  long  standing  principle  that  the  tax  treatment  of  income  is determined  by  its  nature. That  is,  income  which  is  properly  employment income should be assessed as such. Consistent with this principle, section 9A

1 Section 9A caters not only for the arrangements where payment is made to a corporation controlled by the relevant individual, but also for arrangements under which payment is made to a corporation controlled by an associate of the relevant individual or to a trust under which the relevant individual or an associate is a beneficiary. In the context of DIPN No. 25, for the sake of brevity the term 'service company' is used to cover these arrangements.

seeks to ensure that even if an individual is working through a corporation or trust,  but  the  underlying  nature  of  the  arrangement  is  one  of  employment, salaries tax should be assessed and paid accordingly.

## To address the mischief

5. Key to the legislation in section 9A is the payment of remuneration under an agreement for services to a corporation controlled by an individual or his associate, a trustee of a trust under which the individual or his associate is beneficiary. Instead of being paid as a salary to the individual concerned, the remuneration  is  paid  as  a  consultancy  fee  to  the  service  company.    The arrangement is structured with a view to the service company paying little, if any,  tax  on  the  fee  as  a  result  of  deductions  claimed  for  'tax  efficient' employee benefits provided to the individual or his associate. Under section 9A, the remuneration will be assessed to salaries tax as employment income.
6. Prior to the introduction of the provisions in section 9A, the parties concerned  directed  their  efforts  at  circumventing  formal  employer/employee relationships and accordingly did not comply with the notification requirements imposed  on  employers  and  employees  under  the  Ordinance. Section  9A(1) makes it clear that for the purposes of the Ordinance, unless specified criteria are satisfied, the person for whom the services are rendered and the individual who  renders  the  services  are  to  be  respectively  treated  as  employer  and employee.    As  such,  the  normal  notification  and  compliance  requirements imposed  by  the  Ordinance  on  employers  and  employees  will  be  applicable. Failure  to  comply  with  the  requirements  might  lead  to  penalty  actions. In Board of Review Decision Case No. D45/05 20 IRBRD 606 , additional tax of approximately 65 per cent of tax undercharged was upheld where the taxpayer failed to report as his employment income in accordance with section 9A sums paid  to  a  service  company  controlled  by  the  taxpayer  and  his  father. The Board of Review ('the Board') ruled that misapprehension of the law was not an excuse for the incorrect return made and the responsibility of making correct returns rested squarely on the taxpayer even if auditors were engaged.

## SCHEME OF THE LEGISLATION

## Three main elements

7. Briefly, the legislation has three main elements which are contained in section 9A:
2. (a) There is a prima facie liability to salaries tax where remuneration for services rendered by a 'relevant individual' is paid to a corporation  controlled  by  the  individual or his associate or a trustee of a trust under which the individual or his associate is a beneficiary.
3. (b) The  scope  of  the  provisions  is  restricted  by  excluding  cases which satisfy specified criteria (i.e. where particular indicators or  hallmarks  of  an  office  or  employment  of  profit  are  not present under the arrangement).
4. (c) Under  an  'escape  clause'  for  the  benefit  of  taxpayers,  the Commissioner  has  a  discretionary  power  to  exclude  a  case where,  even  though  an  indicator  of  employment  might  be present, he is satisfied that in carrying out the services under the agreement the relevant individual is not in substance holding an office or employment of profit.

The three elements are further discussed below, together with related matters.

## Prima facie liability

8. Section 9A(1) specifies the circumstances under which the provisions can have application to remuneration paid to a corporation or trustee of a trust estate. In this regard, an arrangement will come within the scope of the section where:
2. (a) there is an agreement;

- (b) a person called the 'relevant person' is carrying on or deemed under  the  Ordinance  to  be  carrying  on  a  trade,  profession  or business, or prescribed activity, is a party to the agreement;
- (c) services  have  been  carried  out  under  the  agreement  by  an individual  called  the  'relevant  individual'  on  or  after  the 'appointed  day'  (see  paragraph  1)  for  the  relevant  person  or any other person; and
- (d) remuneration  for  the  services  has  been  paid  or  credited  on  or after the appointed day to a corporation or trustee as defined in section 9A(1)(a), (b) or (c).
9. In  considering  whether  the  circumstances  referred  to  above  are present in relation to a particular arrangement, the following points should be kept in mind:
- (a) The agreement need not be in writing and can have been entered into before, on or after the appointed day.
- (b) Section  9A(1)  generally  will  only  have  application  where  the relevant person is carrying on, or is deemed to be carrying on, a trade, profession or business. It is expected, based on experience prior to the introduction of the Amendment Ordinance,  that  this  will  cover  the  vast  majority  of  disguised employment  arrangements. However,  if  it  is  discovered  that other  relevant  persons  are  entering  into  such  arrangements, section  9A(6)  provides  the  Commissioner  with  the  power  to bring the persons concerned within the ambit of the legislation by  prescribing,  by  notice  in  the  Gazette,  an  activity  for  the purposes of section 9A. Such a notice will involve subsidiary legislation and will be subject to the scrutiny of the Legislative Council  under  section  34  of  the  Interpretation  and  General Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 1).
- (c) Although section 9A(1) can only apply to a particular relevant individual where he has carried out services under an agreement, it  does  not  require  that  the  agreement  itself  must  contain  any

specific  reference  to  the  relevant  individual  or  to  the  service company. In other words, it cannot be claimed that section 9A does not apply to a particular arrangement simply because the relevant  individual  is  not  mentioned  in  the  agreement. Also, the application of the legislation is not restricted to the situation where the services are carried out by the relevant individual for the  relevant  person. To  ensure  that  arrangements  involving third parties are catered for (e.g. where the services are carried out for a subsidiary of the relevant person), the subsection refers to  services  carried  out  'for  the  relevant  person  or  any  other person'.

- (d) Where  a disguised employment  arrangement is used, the remuneration  under  the  agreement  will  clearly  not  be  paid directly by  the relevant person  to the relevant individual. Typically, payment is made to a corporation controlled by the individual or his associate or a trustee of a trust under which the individual or his associate is a beneficiary.
10. The provisions in section 9A encompass arrangements which involve one or more than one associate, together with or without the relevant individual. Relevant terms, such as 'associate', 'beneficiary', 'control', 'principal officer' and 'relative', are defined in section 9A(8) and along similar lines to those contained in sections 16E, 21A and 39E of the Ordinance. It should be noted,  however,  that  the  definition  of  'associate'  used  in  section  9A(8)  has been  worded  so  that  where  more  than  one  relevant  individual  carries  out services under a single agreement, each will be an associate of the other.

## The operative provisions

11. Where the circumstances referred to above are present, an arrangement  is  subject  to  what  may  be  called  the  operative  provisions  of section 9A(1)(i), (ii) and (iii) unless it falls outside their application by virtue of the escape clauses provided in subsections (3) and (4). In essence, the effect of the operative provisions is to treat the relevant individual and the relevant person as  employee and employer respectively, and the remuneration for the services carried out by the relevant individual as  his  income  from  an employment of profit, and therefore chargeable to salaries tax.

## Example 1

Mr.  E  is  an  IT  consultant  who  provides  services  through  a  service company S Ltd. to a client C Ltd. The agreement is between S Ltd. and  C  Ltd. Mr.  E  and  his  wife  Mrs.  E  own  100  per  cent  of  the shares in S Ltd. Had Mr. E supplied his services direct to C Ltd., the  terms  of  the  contract  are  such  that  he  would  have  been  an employee of C Ltd.

The operative  provisions  in  section  9A(1)(i)  to  (iii)  are  applicable. Section  9A(3)  and  (4)  cannot  be  invoked  to  exempt  Mr.  E  from salaries tax. The effect is: Mr. E is treated as having an employment with C Ltd.; and remuneration paid to or credited to S Ltd.  under  the  agreement  will  be  treated  as  employment  income derived by Mr. E from an employment with C Ltd.

## Example 2

Mr.  E  is  an  IT  consultant  who  provides  services  through  a  trust arrangement  to  a  client  C  Ltd.    The  agreement  is  between  a manager  of  the  trust  and  C  Ltd. Mr.  E  and  his  wife  Mrs.  E  are beneficiaries of the trust. Had Mr. E supplied his services direct to C Ltd., the terms of the contract are such that he would have been an employee of C Ltd.

Section 9A(1)(i) to (iii) are applicable.    Further section 9A(3) and (4) do  not  apply  and  Mr.  E  is  caught  under  the  operative  provisions. The effect is: Mr. E is treated as having an employment with C Ltd.; and  remuneration  paid  to  or  credited  to  the  trustee  under  the agreement will be treated as employment income derived by Mr. E from an employment with C Ltd.

## Section 9A(1)(i) - commencement and termination of employment

12. Section 9A(1)(i) provides that the relevant individual is to be treated as having an employment of profit with the relevant person. Subparagraphs (A)(I) and (A)(II) set down the rules for determining the date of commencement of the employment.

13. Where  the  relevant  person  is  carrying  on  a  trade,  profession  or business, the date of commencement under subparagraph (A)(I) is taken to be the  day  the  relevant  individual  commenced  to  carry  out  services  under  the agreement  or  on  the  appointed  day,  whichever  is  the  later. Accordingly,  for disguised employment arrangements which commenced prior to the introduction of the legislation, the date of commencement is taken to be the appointed day.
14. Where the relevant person is carrying on a prescribed activity, rather than  a  trade,  profession  or  business,  the  date  of  commencement  under subparagraph (A)(II) is taken to be the day the Commissioner prescribed the activity by notice in the Gazette under section 9A(6) or, if it is later, the day the relevant individual commenced to carry out services under the agreement.
15. By virtue of subparagraph (B), the employment of profit is treated as continuing  until  the  agreement  terminates  'without  the  relevant  individual continuing  to  carry  out  any  of  these  services  as  an  employee  of  the  relevant person'. In  other  words,  if  the  relevant  individual  continues  to  serve  as  an employee of the relevant person after the agreement terminates, the situation will not be viewed as involving a cessation of employment.

## Section 9A(1)(ii) - treated as employee and employer

16. Section 9A(1)(ii) unequivocally states that whilst the relevant individual  is  treated,  under  paragraph  (i),  as  having  an  employment  of  profit with the relevant person:
2. (a) 'the relevant individual shall be treated as an employee of the relevant person'; and
3. (b) 'the  relevant  person  shall  be  treated  as  the  employer  of  the relevant individual'.
17. It is pertinent in this regard that the closing words of section 9A(1) provide in effect that where the operative provisions are applicable 'the other provisions of this Ordinance (including section 52) shall be construed accordingly'. It follows that if an arrangement comes within the scope of the operative provisions the relevant person concerned is subject to the compliance requirements imposed on employers, and in particular those under section 52

concerning  notification  of  commencement  and cessation  of  employment  etc. Persons  who  fail  to  comply  with  the  requirements  in question  may  be  liable under the offence provisions contained in Part XIV of the Ordinance.

## Section 9A(1)(iii) - remuneration assessed as employment income

18. Section  9A(1)(iii) ensures  that the remuneration  referred  to  in subsection (1) (i.e. the remuneration which is paid or credited on or after the appointed  day to  the service company  for services  carried  out under  the agreement  by  the  relevant  individual  on or after  that  day)  is  treated  as employment income of the relevant individual. To cover the timing aspect for the purposes of section 11B, section 9A(1)(iii) also provides that the remuneration  should  be  treated  as  being  'received  by  and  accrued  to  the relevant individual at the time that it is paid or credited to the corporation or trustee concerned referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c)'.
19. Situations may arise where remuneration is paid or credited after the appointed  day in  respect  of services  which are  carried  out  by the  relevant individual partly before and partly after that day. In such cases the Department accepts that only the remuneration which is reasonably attributable to the services carried out on or after the appointed day comes within the scope of section 9A. The Department will generally allow apportionment on a time basis, although no hard and fast rules are laid down. Whatever basis is used it should be clearly explained in the salaries tax return of the relevant individual. As  to  the  taxation  treatment  of  the  remuneration  attributable to  the  services carried out prior to the appointed day, see paragraph 57 below.

## Section 9A(2) - remuneration for services

20. It  is  also  possible  that  a  single  service  company  agreement may provide  for services  to  be  carried  out  by more  than  one  relevant  individual and/or for payments to be made for purposes other than remuneration for such services. Where such an arrangement is used it is in the interests of the parties concerned to clearly specify, in the agreement or otherwise, exactly what each payment is for, including the amount of remuneration for the services carried out  by each  relevant individual. Section  9A(2)  is relevant  in  this  regard. This subsection provides, in essence, that where an agreement does not specify the remuneration of a particular relevant individual, any sum paid or credited under the agreement to the service company will be treated as remuneration for

services carried out by that individual unless it is established to the satisfaction of  the  Commissioner  by  the  relevant  individual  concerned  or  the  relevant person that all or part of the sum should be excluded on the ground that it was paid for some other purpose. In  other  words,  unless  the  relevant  particulars are provided, each relevant individual will be potentially liable to salaries tax in respect of the full amount paid or credited to the service company on or after the appointed day.

## Example 3

Mr.  E  and  Mr.  F  are  IT  consultants  who  provide  their  services through a service company S Ltd. to a client C Ltd. The agreement is between S Ltd. and C Ltd. Mr. E and Mr. F own 100 per cent of the shares in S Ltd. Had Mr. E and Mr. F supplied their services direct to C Ltd., the terms of the contracts are such that they would have been employees of C Ltd.

Section 9A(1)(i) to (iii) are applicable. Further section 9A(3) and (4) cannot be invoked to exempt Mr. E and Mr. F from salaries tax. Section  9A(7)(a)  makes  it  clear  that  the  operative  provisions  will apply to Mr. E and Mr. F individually. The effect is: Mr. E and Mr. F are each treated as  having  an  employment  with  C  Ltd.;  and remuneration paid to or credited to S Ltd. under the agreement will be treated as employment income derived by Mr. E and Mr. F from C Ltd.

## SPECIFIED CRITERIA

## Operative provisions do not apply

21. The operative provisions discussed above do not apply in relation to remuneration under an agreement where all of the specified criteria laid down in sections 9A(3)(a)  to  (f) inclusive are satisfied. The  criteria  in  question represent  some of the factors which may indicate that the services carried out under  an  agreement  do  not  in  substance  amount  to  holding  an  office  or employment of profit. Passing or failing any particular criterion is not necessarily conclusive  either  way. For  example,  a  person  may  be  paid  on  a  periodic  basis

which does not satisfy section 9A(3)(d), yet still be able to satisfy the Commissioner that  he  does  not  in  substance  hold  an  office  or  employment  of  profit. The Department  accepts,  however,  that  if  the  criteria  are  all  satisfied  an  office  or employment of profit is not involved. Each is briefly discussed in turn below.

## Section 9A(3)(a) - provision of employment-type benefits

22. This  criterion  will  be  satisfied  if  neither  the  agreement  nor  any related  undertaking  provides  for  remuneration  for  the  services  carried  out  by the relevant individual to include or to be the provision of any of the specified or similar employment-type benefits or any benefit (including money) in lieu thereof. It should be noted that in considering whether or not the criterion has been  satisfied,  the  key  question  is  not  whether  the  relevant  individual  has directly  received  a  benefit  as  compensation,  but  whether  the  agreement  or related undertaking provides for the remuneration to include such a benefit or compensation (i.e. the identity of the recipient need not be taken into account).

## Section 9A(3)(b) - personal performance

23. This  criterion  reflects  the  view  that  it  is  far  more  usual  for  an employment relationship to require that services be performed personally by a particular individual than it would be in the case of an independent contractor. In the latter situation it is not unusual to allow the engagement of sub-contractors. However,  it  is  recognised  that  an  independent  contractor may  be  engaged  on  terms  which  require  a  certain  individual  to  carry  out services required (e.g. a particular architect may be nominated to prepare the plans for a building). Accordingly, the general position under this provision is that  the  criterion  will  not  be  satisfied  where  the  agreement  or  any  related undertaking requires that the services be performed personally by the relevant individual. However, to cater for a genuine contractor who has more than one client, it will be satisfied where the relevant individual also carries out the same or similar services for persons other than the person for whom they are carried out under the agreement.

## Section 9A(3)(c) - subject to control or supervision

24. This provision is concerned with the question of whether the relevant individual in performing the services under the agreement is subject to control or supervision of a kind which is usual under an employment relationship.    In this  regard,  the  criterion  will  be  satisfied  if  there  is  not  any  control  or supervision 'which may be commonly exercised by an employer in relation to the performance of his employee's duties'. It would be unusual for a relevant person  to  exercise  such  control  or  supervision  in  respect  of  an  individual carrying  out  duties  on  behalf  of  an  independent  contractor.    Whereas  an employer normally (although there can be exceptions) has the right to direct the manner in which work is performed by an employee, a contractor usually has freedom as  to  the  way  in  which  tasks  are  carried  out,  subject  to  compliance with  job  specifications  as  detailed  in  the  relevant  contract.    Accordingly, where supervision or control of the kind specified is present, it will generally provide a strong indication of employment.
25. In considering the position of a relevant individual in relation to this criterion,  section  9A(3)(c)(ii)  has  the  effect  of  providing  that  any  control  or supervision exercised by the corporation or trustee concerned may  be disregarded. As a matter  of  practice  the  Department  will  also  not  take  into account any supervision or control which can be directly attributed to statutory requirements and is not dependent on the existence of an employer/employee relationship.

## Section 9A(3)(d) - basis of remuneration

26. The focus of this provision is the basis on which the remuneration is paid  or  credited. The  criterion  will  be  satisfied  if  the  remuneration  'is  not paid  or  credited  periodically  and  calculated  on  a  basis  commonly  used  in relation  to  the  payment  or  crediting  and  calculation  of  remuneration  under  a contract  of  employment'.    As  such,  regard  must  be  had  not  only  to  the question of whether payments are made periodically, but also to the basis for calculating the payments for the work performed.
27. It should as a rule be a relatively straightforward matter to distinguish payments  of  a  kind made  to  contractors, even  if  made  by instalments or as progress payments, from those made on a basis used under

employment contracts.    For contractor situations the payments will generally be in relation to an agreed sum for specified work under a contract, whereas for employment cases payments are usually in respect of the time worked or position occupied and made on a regular basis (e.g. weekly, fortnightly or monthly).

## Section 9A(3)(e) - termination of the arrangement

28. This criterion is concerned with the provisions under the agreement relating to the termination of the arrangement between the parties. It will be satisfied  if  the  relevant  person  does  not  have  the  right  to  cause  any  of  the services under the agreement 'to cease to be carried out in a manner, or for a reason,  commonly  provided  for  in  relation  to  the  dismissal  of  an  employee under a contract of employment'. In this regard, the services of an employee can generally be terminated by providing the relevant notice and/ or meeting other  requirements  under  an  award  or  statute. By  way  of  contrast,  under  a relationship  involving  an  independent  contractor,  the  contract  will  usually  be discharged by performance, but may also specify other circumstances, such as default situations, under which it can be terminated.

## Section 9A(3)(f) - representation to the public

29. As  is  stated  in  the  provision,  this  criterion  will  be  satisfied  where 'the  relevant  individual  is  not  held  out  to  the  public  to  be  an  officer  or employee of the relevant  person'. The term 'held out to  the  public'  is  not defined in the Ordinance and should therefore be given its ordinary meaning. As such, if either the relevant individual or relevant person acts in a manner or does something that is intended to lead members of the public to believe that the  relevant  individual  is  an  officer  or  employee  of  the  relevant  person,  the criterion will not have been satisfied. This could occur, for example, through material included in trade or professional directories, journals or other publications,  the  issue  of  name  cards,  statements  made  at  public  functions, information contained in press releases etc.
30. It is appreciated that there may be cases where 'independent' agents working in, for example, the real estate and insurance fields will be unable to satisfy this criterion. However, if the persons concerned are held out to the public to be employees of the organisations  they  represent,  then  their  cases  will  in  any  event warrant close examination before it is accepted that employment is not involved.

## Satisfying the criteria

31. Where all of the specified criteria are satisfied, a relevant individual will not have any liability to salaries tax by virtue of section 9A. Likewise, the  section  will  not  have  the  effect  of  imposing  on  the  relevant  person  the compliance requirements applicable to employers under section 52.
32. In Board of Review Decision Case No. D13/06 21 IRBRD 341 ,  the taxpayer  through  his  wholly-owned  company  entered  into  a  contract  for  the provision of his services to a hospital. The Board concluded that section 9A(3) had not been satisfied: in relation to section 9A(3)(b) his teaching services for other persons were irrelevant since they were not material or incidental to the services performed under the contract; in relation to section 9A(3)(c) he was at the top of his field and the level of control should be viewed in light of this; and  in  relation  to  section  9A(3)(e)  though  express  termination  provision  are absent, the contract could still be terminated for a reason commonly provided for in relation to an employee.
33. Where  a  relevant  individual  is  unable  to  meet  one  or  more  of  the specified  criteria,  it  does  not  necessarily  follow  that  the  operative  provisions shall  apply  to  remuneration  under  the  agreement.    Section  9A(4)  provides another  avenue  of  escape  for  those  cases  where  the  relevant  individual establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that at all relevant times the carrying  out  of  the  services  under  the  agreement  'was  not  in  substance  the holding by him of an office or employment of profit with the relevant person'.

## THE COMMISSIONER'S DISCRETION: SECTION 9A(4)

## Focus on the substance

34. Section 9A(3) may be viewed as a somewhat mechanical means of ascertaining whether the operative provisions can be disregarded. However, the approach has been taken on the footing that where none of the indicators of employment  covered  by  the  specified  criteria  is  present,  it  may  be  safely concluded,  without  examining  the  case  in  greater  detail,  that  in  substance employment  is  not  involved.    In  short,  it  is  intended  to  be  a  pragmatic approach for the convenience of taxpayers and the Department alike.

35. The  situation  is  clearly  quite  different  where  one  of  the  specified criteria is not satisfied. In such a case there will at least be an indication of an employment relationship.    Careful consideration of all of the circumstances of the arrangement will be required before it can be concluded whether or not in substance one exists.
36. In considering cases under subsection (4), the Commissioner will of course  have  regard  to  the  substantial  body  of  case  law  concerning  the distinction  between  a  contract  of  service  (i.e.  one  of  employment)  and  a contract for services (i.e. independent contractor).
37. In Poon  Chau  Nam  v.  Yim  Shiu  Cheung  [2007]  HKLRD  951 , Ribeiro PJ at the Court of Final Appeal confirmed that the modern approach to the question whether a person was an employee was to examine all the features of their relationship against the background of the indicia of employment with a view to deciding whether, as a matter of overall impression, the relationship was  one  of  employment.    This  involved  a  nuanced  and  not  a  mechanical approach:  painting  a  picture  from  the  accumulation  of  detail. The  indicia included the degree of control exercised by the 'employer'; whether the person performing the services provided his own equipment; whether he hired his own helpers; what degree of financial risk he took; what degree of responsibility for investment  and  management  he  had; and  whether  and  how  far  he  had  an opportunity of profiting from sound management in the performance of his task. In Board of Review Decision Case No. D13/06 21 IRBRD 341 ,  referred to in paragraph  32,  the  Board  also  ruled  that  section  9A(4)  was  not  satisfied:  the taxpayer had one full-time job; he received a monthly income; he was under the hospital's control; he held himself out as an officer of the hospital and no real entrepreneurship on the part of the taxpayer.
38. Subsection (4) was considered in Board of Review Decision Case No.  D155/01  17  IRBRD  231 though  the  case  was  decided  primarily  on  the ground  that  section  61A  applied  to  counteract  the  tax  benefit  from  the arrangement entered  into. The case involved the provision  of  services  by  a programme production manager to a television company through his personal services  company.    The  Board  concluded  that  section  9A  applied  to  the arrangement. Although factors existed in support of the taxpayer's contention that he was not an employee of the television company (such as the fact that he did not receive all benefits available to employees, no redundancy payment was

made on the termination of the agreement for the provision of services, he had no set office hours, he had no computer and he was not required to attend staff meetings), the Board upon a global assessment was satisfied that the taxpayer was in substance an employee.

39. Subsection (4) was also considered in Case No. D78/06 22 IRBRD 36 , which decided primarily that the interposition of the service company was to be disregarded under section 61. The Board were not satisfied that the taxpayer, a  resident  engineer  for  a  project,  was  not  in  substance  an  employee  of  two companies  contracting  with  the  service  company  for  his  services  because: remuneration  was  payable  monthly  in  arrears  and  was  fixed  (subject  to adjustment);  neither  the  taxpayer  nor  the  service  company  ran  any  financial risk nor could they profit from sound management; the taxpayer was granted annual leave; he was given office space; he did not provide his own equipment and the agreement could be summarily terminated.
40. In Case  No.  D78/06  22  IRBRD  36 ,  the  Board  explained  that  the relationship  had  to  be  determined  by  an  investigation  and  evaluation  of  the factual circumstances in which the work was performed and it had been firmly established that the question of whether or not the work was performed in the capacity of an employee or as an independent contractor is to be regarded by an appellate court as a question of fact to be determined by the trial court.

## Control test and integration test

41. Although in many cases the control test can still be simply applied to determine  the  matter,  there  are  situations  where  it  proves  to  be  inadequate. For example, it is not now unusual for professional or highly skilled individuals to  perform  their  tasks  on  the  basis  of  their  own  judgement  when  engaged  as employees. It  is  therefore  not  surprising  that  a  further  test,  known  as  the integration test, was recognised alongside the control test. This was introduced  by  Lord  Denning  in Bank  voor  Handel  en  Scheepvaart  NV  v. Administrator of Hungarian Property [1954] 35 TC 311, HL where he said:

'In this connection I would observe the test of being a servant does not rest nowadays on submission to orders. It depends on whether the person is part and parcel of the organisation.'

## Economic reality test

42. A  further  test,  the  economic  reality  test,  was  applied  in Market Investigations Ltd. v. Minister of Social Security, [1969] 2 QB 173 . This test has  regard  to  matters  such  as  whether  the  individual  is  involved  in  the management of the work and is placed at financial risk, whether he can employ others to assist and whether he provides major equipment. However, in 1984 the  Court  of  Appeal,  in Nethermere  (St.  Neots)  Ltd.  v.  Gardiner  1  CR  612 , rejected the view that the economic reality test was 'the fundamental test' and regarded it as 'no more than a useful test'.
43. What has become clear from the cases, as Nolan J stated in the Court of Appeal in Hall v. Lorimer [1994] STC 23 , is that:

'In cases of this sort there is no single path to a correct decision. An approach  which  suits  the  facts  and  arguments  of  one  case  may  be unhelpful in another.'

He went on to cite with approval the views expressed by Mummery J earlier in the case in the High Court, where he said:

'The process involves painting a picture in each individual case. As Vinelott J said in Walls v. Sinnett (Inspector of Taxes) [1986] STC 236 at 245 : 'It is, in my judgment, impossible in a field where a very large  number  of  factors  have  to  be  weighed  to  gain  any  real assistance  by  looking  at  the  facts  of  another  case  and  comparing them one by one to see what facts are common, what are different and  what  particular  weight  is  given  by  another  tribunal  to  the common facts. The facts as a whole must be looked at, and a factor which may be compelling in one case in the light of the facts of that case may not be compelling in the context of another case.' '

## Mutuality of obligation

44. The doctrine of mutuality of obligation has become an important test in determining employment status. The essence of the employment is that the employer is under an obligation to provide work to the employee just as much as the employee is under an obligation to carry out work. There must be an

irreducible minimum of mutual obligation for there to be a contract of service. That irreducible minimum is that the engager must be obliged to pay a wage or other remuneration, and that the worker must be obliged to provide his or her own work or skill. In the case of Poon Chau Nam , Ribeiro PJ confirmed the importance  of  mutuality  of  obligation  in  establishing  the  existence  of  an umbrella or global contract of service where there is a series of engagements. In Usetech  v.  Young  [2004]  STC  1671 ,  Park  J  explained  that  the  want  of mutuality would preclude the existence of a continuing contract of employment where there was both no obligation to provide work and no obligation to pay the worker for time in which work was not provided.

## Comprehensive details

45. It should therefore be clear that the Commissioner will only be able to  form  a  view  for  the  purposes  of  section  9A(4)  if  he  is  provided  with comprehensive details of all the facts surrounding an agreement.
46. A relevant individual who wishes to have the Commissioner exercise his  discretion  under  the  subsection  may  advise  the  Department  either  at  the time of lodging his or her tax return or by means of a separate application for an advance ruling which can be made at any time.    The supporting material and information required is the same in each case and is discussed below.

## ADVANCE RULINGS

## Request for advance ruling

47. A  request  for  an  advance  ruling  should  be  in  writing  and  be addressed to the Commissioner. It must be signed by the relevant individual or  his  authorized  representative.    The  following  material  and  information should support the request:
2. (a) Copies  of  the  agreement  and  any  related  undertaking. If  an agreement or undertaking has not been reduced to writing, an explanation of why this is the case should be provided together with full details of its terms and conditions.

- (b) If  not  otherwise  apparent,  full  details  of  the  remuneration payable under each agreement or undertaking, including fringe benefits, share awards, share options etc.
- (c) Copies  of  the  respective  organisation  charts  of  the  relevant person and the service company.
- (d) A statement setting out the relevant individual's:
- (i) duties  and  obligations  in  relation  to  the  relevant  person and the service company respectively; and
- (ii) previous  employment  history,  if  any,  with  the  relevant person or any associated party.
- (e) A  statement listing, together with supporting details, the specified criteria in subsection (3) which have been satisfied.
- (f) An  explanation  of  why  it  is  considered  that  the  relevant individual did not in substance hold an office or employment of profit.

## Questions to be answered

48. To facilitate consideration of the application, answers should also be provided to the questions listed on Appendix B. If a particular question is not pertinent  to  the  relevant  individual's  situation,  this  should  be  noted  together with a brief explanation of why that is the case.
49. Under  normal  circumstances,  where  the  information  referred  to above is provided, it should be sufficient to allow a ruling to be made. In such cases,  it  will  be  issued  in  letter  form  signed  by  the  Commissioner  or  an authorised  officer,  generally  within  6  weeks  of  the  date  of  receipt  of  the application. In some cases, however, it may be necessary for the Department to  seek  further  information  from  the  relevant  individual  or  a  third  party. Where this occurs it may not be possible to issue the ruling within the 6 weeks period. It  should  be  noted  that  rulings  will  not  be  provided  in  respect  of hypothetical, contemplated or proposed situations.

## COMPLIANCE

## Notification requirements under section 52

50. From  the  perspective  of  the  relevant  person,  if  an  agreement  has been entered into which comes within section 9A(1) and is not excluded from the scope of the operative provisions by virtue of subsection (3) or (4), there will be an obligation to comply with the notification requirements of section 52 (i.e.  on  the  basis  that  the  relevant  person  is  the  employer  of  the  relevant individual - see paragraphs 11 to 20 above). On the other hand, if it is clear that  subsection  (3)  or  (4)  is  applicable,  the  provisions  of  section  52  will  not apply.

## Section 80(1AA)

51. It  is  possible,  however,  that  a  relevant  person  may  be  unsure  as  to whether the operative provisions apply to a particular arrangement (e.g. it may not be clear as to whether the relevant individual controls the service company or  whether all  of  the  specified  criteria  in  subsection  (3)  have  been  satisfied). To cater for such cases, section 80(1AA) in effect allows a relevant person to presume in certain circumstances that the reporting obligations do not apply. The  section  provides  that  it  shall  be  a  defence  in  any  proceedings  against  a person for failure to comply with the requirements of section 52(4), (5), (6) or (7) if he shows that he relied upon a statement in writing by the relevant individual 'in  the  form  specified'  and  it  was  reasonable  for  him  to  rely  upon  that statement. In  this  regard,  section  80(1AC)  provides  that  the  Commissioner may specify the form of statement by notice in the Gazette (see Appendix C).
52. It  can  be  seen  from  the  specified  form  that  a  relevant  individual should only complete the statement where he is able to say that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, one or more of the following situations is applicable in relation to the agreement:
3. (a) the party to which the remuneration is paid or credited is not a corporation or trustee  of  the  kind  referred  to  in  section  9A(1) (e.g. if a corporation, it is  not  controlled  in  the  manner described);

- (b) all of the specified criteria are satisfied;
- (c) the Commissioner has confirmed in writing that he is satisfied that  in  carrying  out  services  under  the  agreement  he  is  not  in substance  holding  an  office  or  employment  of  profit  with  the relevant person.
53. It goes without saying that the defence provided for in section 80(1AA) will  not  apply  if  a  relevant  person  has  reason  to  doubt  that  the  relevant individual is entitled to make a statement of the kind in question. In such a situation  the  relevant  person  should,  as  a  matter  of  prudence,  proceed  on  the footing that  the  reporting  requirements are  applicable.    The  Department  will not, however, take any action in relation to a failure of the employer to comply with the requirements if during the relevant period the relevant individual was awaiting  the  outcome  of  an  application  for  a  ruling  from  the  Commissioner under section 9A(4).
54. As far as the relevant individual is concerned, if he has any doubt as to whether the service company is of the kind referred to in section 9A(1) or whether all of the specified criteria are satisfied, he should obtain a ruling from the  Commissioner  before  providing  the  relevant  person  with  a  statement  in writing. In  this  regard,  it  should  be  kept  in  mind  that  section  80(1AB) provides  that  a  person  who  knowingly  or  recklessly  makes  such  a  statement which in a material respect is false or misleading shall be guilty of an offence. The  sanctions  provided  for  under  sections  82  and  82A  may  also  have application where a relevant individual fails to comply with his obligations.

## COMMENCEMENT OF THE LEGISLATION

## Appointed day

55. As provided in the Amendment Ordinance, the legislation came into operation on the 'appointed day' (i.e. 18 August 1995). The legislation does not apply to any service company agreement entered into before the appointed day where the remuneration was paid or the services were carried out, or both were effected, prior to that date. The legislation will apply in relation to such an agreement where the remuneration is paid or credited and the services are

carried out on or after that date. The legislation will, of course, also apply in respect of agreements entered into on or after the appointed day.

56. The 'appointed day' serves to place it beyond any doubt that where an arrangement is in existence on or after that date and comes within the scope of the legislation, there is a compliance obligation to provide information to the Department. As far as arrangements which commenced before the appointed day are concerned, the Department will not take any penalty action in respect of  failure  to  comply  with  section  52  reporting  requirements  that  may  have existed  before  that  date. The  table  setting  out  the  Department's  position  in relation to the application of sections 9A and 52 is attached as Appendix D.
57. One of the purposes of the legislation is to facilitate the identification of  disguised  employment  arrangements. It  stands  to  reason  that  where  it  is established  that  such  an  arrangement  exists,  income  derived  both  before  and after  the  appointed  day  may  be  charged  to salaries  tax.    The  Department's view is that if the provisions of the Ordinance (including sections 61 and 61A) existing prior to the introduction of section 9A had the effect of rendering the earlier  income  chargeable  to  salaries  tax,  it  is  only  appropriate  to  assess  the income accordingly.
58. It is pertinent to mention at this point that where an arrangement falls outside  the  scope  of  section  9A  (i.e.  even  if  entered  into  after  the  appointed day), it may still, depending on the facts of the case, be charged to salaries tax by application of the general anti-avoidance provisions. For example, it might be considered appropriate to apply those provisions if a 'relevant person' not carrying  on  a  trade,  profession  or  business  or  prescribed  activity  engaged  a person to  carry  out  services  under  a  disguised  employment  agreement. The Department considers that its position in this regard is supported by the decision of the Privy Council in CIR v. Challenge Corporation Limited [1987] 2 WLR 24 . This  was  to  the  effect  that  a  general  anti-avoidance  provision  can  apply notwithstanding the existence of related specific anti-avoidance provisions. In Case No. D78/06 22 IRBRD 36 , the Board of Review in its decision ruled that the interposition of the service company was to be disregarded under section 61A while agreeing with Deputy Commissioner that the case was also caught under section 9A.

## TAX POSITION OF THE PARTIES

## Tax position of corporation and trustee

59. To  prevent  double  taxation,  section  9A(5)  provides  that  where  by virtue  of  section  9A  a  relevant  individual  is  chargeable  to  salaries  tax  on remuneration referred to in subsection (1), the corporation or trustee to whom that remuneration is paid or credited is not chargeable to tax on the remuneration.    Accordingly,  no  deductions  under  section  16  or  depreciation allowances under Part VI will be granted to the service company in respect of related expenditure.

## Tax position of relevant individual

60. Subsection (5) also provides, in effect, that the relevant individual is not  chargeable  to  tax  on  any  remuneration  paid  or  credited  to  him  by  the corporation  or  trustee  as  an  employee  to  the  extent  that  the  remuneration  is attributable to services carried out under the agreement. This exemption will not  apply  in  respect  of  any  remuneration  which  is  not  attributable  to  such services (e.g. services carried out by the relevant individual which are unrelated to the agreement with the relevant person).

## Service companies used by professionals

61. Reflecting the taxation principle that it is not possible for a man to employ himself, section 9A(7) has the effect of providing that the proprietors and partners of unincorporated businesses (e.g. professional firms) with service companies  are  excluded  from  the  application  of  the  operative  provisions  of section 9A. Section 9A(7)(b)(i) covers the situation where a sole proprietorship is involved and section 9A(7)(b)(ii) addresses partnership cases. The Department's  treatment  of  service  company  arrangements  of  this  kind  is detailed in Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 24.
