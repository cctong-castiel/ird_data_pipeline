## INTRODUCTION

Section 16(1) of the Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  provides  that outgoings  and  expenses  incurred  in  the  production  of  assessable  profits  are deductible for profits tax purposes. Commissions, rebates and discounts will qualify for deduction if they satisfy this condition.  This Practice Note sets out the disclosure requirements in respect of these outgoings and expenses and the action  the  Department  will  take  in  the  absence  of  sufficient  documentary evidence to support any such deduction claimed.

## FIELD AUDIT FINDINGS

2. The  Department  has  been  conducting  field  audits  on  selected  tax returns since 1991.  In the course of these audits, the following irregularities in relation to commissions have been spotted in some cases:
2. (a) the  recipient  of  the  commission  was  a  closely  connected non-resident and yet this fact was not properly reflected in the profits tax return under the part for transaction with non-resident;
3. (b) some commission payments were grouped with the purchase cost of goods resulting in no or a smaller commission expense figure in the profit and loss accounts; and
4. (c) unsubstantiated commission payments were charged in accounts.

In all of these cases, the Assessors found the payments unjustified and issued assessments disallowing the payments and instituted penal actions subsequently.

3. It  is  clear  from  these  findings  that  certain  auditors  have  failed  to  use proper audit procedures to detect what can at best be described as failures to distinguish these payments in the accounts and tax computations, or at worst, deliberate attempts to mislead the Revenue by misdescribing the payments or making unsubstantiated claims.  The Department takes a serious view on these instances  and  penal  action  under  the  Ordinance  will,  almost  invariably,  be instituted against those people who have made the unjustified claims.

## DISCLOSURE RULES

4. In  order  to  ascertain  the  deductibility  of  commissions,  rebates  and discounts  made  by  the  taxpayer,  it  is  necessary  for  the  following  disclosure requirements to be met, when filing profits tax returns:
2. (a) instead of showing the income net of commissions, rebates and discounts, taxpayers should return the gross income and clearly distinguish the payment of commissions, rebates and discounts in the accounts and tax computations submitted in support of profits tax returns;
3. (b) the following information should be disclosed for each payment:
4. (i) full name, address and identity card number or business registration number of the recipient;
5. (ii) whether  the  recipient  has  any  relationship  with  the taxpayer;
6. (iii) amount of the payment;
7. (iv) details of services rendered; and preferably
8. (v) evidence of payment.
5. The only exceptions to the disclosure rule mentioned in 4(a) above are:
10. (a) commissions,  rebates  and  discounts  allowed  in  the  ordinary course  of  trade  on  a  principal  to  principal  basis  where  it  is expected that such commissions, rebates or discounts would be reflected in the accounts of each party to the transaction;
11. (b) commissions, rebates and discounts paid to any individual who is an employee or otherwise of either principal and the separate amounts  are  disclosed  under  the  name  and  address  of  the recipient  on  the  statutory  BIR  Form  No.56A  (employer's return).

## THE ARRANGEMENT

6. Where the taxpayer is unable or unwilling to disclose the names and addresses of the recipients, the amounts paid by way of commissions, rebates and discounts should be disallowed in the tax computations.  This arrangement is accepted as a compromise to the business concerned and it does not relieve the recipient of these payments from his responsibility to return the amount for tax purposes.
7. However, this arrangement is not acceptable to the Department in the following circumstances:
3. (a) the payer suffers an overall operating loss in the basis period in which the commissions, etc., were incurred;
4. (b) the  expenses  were  incurred  in  part  of  an  accounting  period which does not fall into a basis period and will consequently drop out for assessment purposes; or
5. (c) these expenses were incurred in respect of a capital transaction and would not have been allowable as a deduction in the first place.

In each of the above scenarios, the payer will either be assessed as agent of the recipients of commissions, etc., or he should disclose the information as stated in paragraph 4(b) for direct assessments to be raised on the recipients.  Failure of the  payer  to  disclose  such  information  would  be  followed  by  action  under section 51(4)(a) of the Ordinance.

## CONCEALED COMMISSION, REBATE AND DISCOUNT PAYMENTS

8. Where  taxpayers  have  made  commission,  rebate  and  discount payments without proper disclosure and caused loss to the  revenue,  they  are advised  to  take  advantage  of  the  statement  of  practice  relating  to  voluntary disclosure  contained  in  Departmental  Interpretation  &amp;  Practice  Notes  No.  11 (Elements of Tax Investigation).  Taxpayers who do not would run a grave risk of  prosecution  under  the  Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  when,  as  a  result  of

Departmental  enquiries,  evidence  of  concealed  commissions  is  obtained.    In addition, the auditor responsible may also be liable to prosecution under sections 80 and 82 of the Ordinance.
