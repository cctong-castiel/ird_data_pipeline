## INTRODUCTION

Section 26A(1A) of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (the Ordinance) provides tax exemption to sums derived from specified investment schemes in respect  of  mutual  funds,  unit  trusts  and  similar  investment  schemes.    The purpose of this Practice Note is to outline the provisions contained in section 26A(1A) and to lay down broad statements on the interpretation and practice to be adopted by the Inland Revenue Department in relation to the application of the section.

## KEY ELEMENTS OF THE LEGISLATION

## Taxpayers entitled to exemption

2. Section  26A(1A)(a)  restricts  the  application  of  the  section  to  the following categories of persons -
2. ' (i) a  person  chargeable  to  tax  under  this  Part  in  respect  of  a mutual fund, unit trust or similar investment scheme that is authorized as a collective investment scheme under section 104 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571); or
3. (ii) a  person  chargeable  to  tax  under  this  Part  in  respect  of  a mutual fund, unit trust or similar investment scheme where the Commissioner is satisfied that the mutual fund, unit trust or investment scheme is a bona fide widely held investment scheme which complies with the requirements of a supervisory authority within an acceptable regulatory regime.'

The  various  types  of  qualifying  schemes  and  other  requirements  are  further discussed in the following paragraphs.

## Mutual funds, unit trusts and similar investment schemes

3. The  application  of  section  26A(1A)  is  restricted  to  mutual  funds, unit trusts and similar investment schemes.    It is of paramount importance to

understand the meaning of these terms.

4. 'Mutual  fund'  and  'unit  trust'  are  defined  in  section  26A(2)  as follows -
2. (a) 'mutual fund' means any arrangement made for the purpose, or having the effect, of providing facilities for investment in shares  in  a  corporation  which  is  or  hold  itself  out  as  being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading  in  securities  and  which  is  offering  for  sale  or  has outstanding any redeemable shares of which it is the issuer.
3. (b) 'unit trust' means any arrangement made for the purpose, or having the effect, of providing facilities for the participation by persons, as beneficiaries under a trust, in profits or income arising from the acquisition, holding, management or disposal of securities or any other property whatsoever.

They  fall  within  the  meaning  of  'collective  investment  scheme'  under  the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the SFO).

5. There is, however, no definition of 'similar investment scheme' in the  Ordinance.  The  reference  to  'similar  investment  scheme'  in  section 26A(1A) is intended primarily to cater for investment arrangements established under civil law which are in substance the same as unit trusts or mutual funds which fall within the scope of section 26A(1A), but have a different legal form (e.g. a 'Fond Commun D' Placement' which is essentially a contractual mutual fund, although not incorporated or established under trust).    To be a qualified scheme, among others, the investors concerned should have no control over the management  of  the  funds  they  have  invested  in  the  scheme  (other  than indirectly by being able to exercise voting rights in relation to the appointment of fund managers).

## Conditions for exemption

6. Not  all  mutual  funds,  units  trusts  and  similar  investment  schemes qualify  for  exemption  automatically. To  qualify  for  exemption,  any  such investment scheme must satisfy either one of the two alternative conditions, i.e.

- (i)  it  is  authorized  as  a  collective  investment  scheme  under  the  SFO;  or  (ii) where the Commissioner is satisfied that certain specified requirements are met. Paragraphs 7 and 8 below deal with the first condition while paragraphs 9 to 14 below deal with the second one.

## Authorized collective investment schemes

7. From 1 April 2003 onwards, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)  is  given  the  power,  under  section  104(1)  of  the  SFO,  to  authorize collective investment schemes (which include mutual funds and unit trusts) as it  considers  fair  and  reasonable.    The  conditions  for  authorization  generally imposed by the SFC are set out in its 'Code on Unit Trusts and Mutual Funds' (the  Code)  which  is  included  in  Section  II  of  the  SFC  Handbook  for  Unit Trusts and Mutual Funds, Investment-Linked Assurance Schemes and Unlisted Structured  Investment  Products.  Briefly,  the  Code  is  divided  into  three  parts which cover the following -

## Part I: General matters

- (a) authorization  procedures  (such  as  the  requirement  that  an applicant for authorization must submit a completed Application Form together with specified supporting documents);
- (b) recognition of schemes established in certain regulated jurisdictions;
- (c) nomination of an individual as an approved person;
- (d) set  up  of  a  Products  Advisory  Committee  by  the  SFC  to consult and advise on matters relating to collective investment schemes; and
- (e) definitions of terms used in the Code ('collective investment scheme'  or  'scheme'  means  collective  investment  schemes commonly regarded as mutual funds (whether they appear in the legal forms of contractual model, companies with variable capital or otherwise) and unit trusts).

## Part II: Authorization requirements

- (f) role  of  the  trustee/custodian  (every  collective  investment scheme  for  which  authorization  is  requested  must  appoint  a trustee, in the case of a trust, or a custodian, for a mutual fund, acceptable to the SFC);
- (g) role of the management company (every collective investment scheme  for  which  authorization  is  requested  must  appoint  a fund management company acceptable to the SFC, except as provided in the Code for cases where a scheme's own board of  directors  are  to  perform  the  functions  of  a  management company);
- (h) appointment of the auditor for the scheme;
- (i) operational requirements (in respect of scheme documentation; maintenance  of  a  register  of  holders;  information  detailing investment plans; pricing, issue and redemption of units/shares; general meetings of the holders of units or shares; and fees);
- (j) core requirements of the investment limitations and prohibitions, other than for specialized schemes (e.g. a scheme  is  prohibited  from,  among  others,  investing  in  any type  of  real  estate  (including  buildings)  or  interests  in  real estate (including options or rights, but excluding shares in real estate companies and interests in real estate investment trusts (REITs));
- (k) guidelines  for  various  specialized  schemes  (i.e.  any  scheme whose primary objective is not investment in equities and/or bonds;  any  scheme  falling  under  the  categories  specified  in Chapter  8  of  the  Code,  namely  unit  portfolio  management funds, money market/cash management funds, warrant funds, futures  and  options  funds,  guaranteed  funds,  index  funds, hedge  funds, structured funds, and  funds that invest in financial derivative instruments; or any scheme which

otherwise does not meet the core requirements of the investment  limitations  and  prohibitions  referred  to  above); and

- (l) additional  requirements  for  non-Hong  Kong  based  schemes (cover  matters  such  as  the  requirement  that  a  Hong  Kong representative must be appointed if the scheme's management company  is  not  incorporated  and  does  not  have  a  place  of business in Hong Kong; appointment criteria; functions of a representative; details of all contracts between the representative,  the  scheme  and/or  the  management  company must be supplied to the SFC; and jurisdiction of the courts of Hong Kong to entertain an action concerning the scheme).

## Part III: Post-authorization requirements

- (m) operational  matters  (in  respect  of  valuation  and  pricing  of  a scheme;  pricing  errors;  changes  to  the  method  of  dealing; suspension  and  deferral  of  dealings;  and  transactions  with connected persons); and
- (n) documentation  and  reporting  requirements  (in  respect  of proposed changes to constitutive documents, of key operators and  in  investment  objectives,  policies  and  restrictions,  fee structure  and  dealing  and  pricing  arrangements;  notices  to holders; intention not to maintain authorized status; merger or termination;  reporting  to  holders;  reporting  to  the  SFC;  and advertising materials).

The  Code  also  includes  six  appendices:  Information  to  be  disclosed  in  the offering  document;  Contents  of  the  constitutive  documents;  Contents  of financial  reports;  Guidelines  for  review  of  internal  controls  and  systems  of trustees/custodians;  Guidelines  on  hedge  funds  reporting  requirements;  and Guidelines for regulating index tracking exchange traded funds.

8. For detailed guidance as to the conditions for authorization imposed by the SFC, reference should, of course, be made to the current version of the Code, which is available on the website of the SFC.

## Non-authorized collective investment schemes

9. With effect from the year of assessment commencing 1 April 1996, section  26A(1A)  was  amended  so  that  in  addition  to  having  application  to authorized mutual fund corporations and the trustees of authorized unit trusts, it also  applies,  where  certain  requirements  are  satisfied,  to  a  mutual  fund corporation established outside Hong Kong, a trustee of a unit trust established outside Hong Kong and a person chargeable to Profits Tax in respect of any other  similar  collective  investment  scheme. In  each  case  (i.e.  where  the scheme is not authorized by the SFC), the concessions provided by the section only  apply  where  the  Commissioner  is  satisfied  that  the  scheme  is  (i)  'bona fide  widely  held';  and  (ii)  'complies  with  the  requirements  of  a  supervisory authority  within  an  acceptable  regulatory  regime'  (collectively  hereinafter referred to as the 'specified requirements').

The specified requirements

## 'bona fide widely held'

10. Section  26A(1A)  does  not  define  what  is  meant  by  a  'bona  fide widely held' scheme.    However, it may be presumed that this requirement is satisfied if during the year of assessment in question at no time did fewer than 50 persons hold (or have the right to become the holders of) all of the units or shares in the scheme, and at no time during the year did fewer than 21 persons hold (or have the right to become the holders of) units or shares that entitled the holders, directly or indirectly, to 75% or more, of the income or property of the scheme.
11. Where  the  above  benchmark  figures  are  not  met,  it  will  still  be accepted in practice that the requirement has been satisfied if it is clear from the constitutive documents of the scheme and other relevant material that it was established with a view to wide public participation and that genuine efforts are being  taken  with  the  aim  of  achieving  that  objective  (i.e.  there  is  nothing  to suggest that the scheme is intended to be a closely held investment vehicle). This situation could arise, for example, where a scheme has only recently been established or where, despite the wishes of the parties concerned, it has proved to be unpopular with investors.

'complies with the requirements of a supervisory authority within an acceptable regulatory regime'

12. It  will  be  accepted,  unless  there  is  evidence  to  the  contrary,  that  a scheme qualifies in this respect if it is a scheme of a kind set out in the list of recognized jurisdictions published on the SFC's website (Recognized Jurisdictions  Schemes)  and  has  received  recognition  of  such  status  from  the supervisory authority corresponding to the SFC in the jurisdiction concerned.
13. For  any  other  case  it  will  be  necessary  for  the  parties  seeking  the application of section 26A(1A) to provide the Department with full details of the  nature  of  the  scheme  and  the  regulatory  regime  under  which  it  operates. Supporting documentary material should be provided, including copies of the material  submitted  to  the  supervisory  authority  of  the  regime  concerned  and confirmation from the authority that the scheme complies with the requirements of the regime.
14. In  essence,  a  regulatory  regime  will  be  regarded  as  acceptable  if  it not  only  lays  down  standards  for  collective  investment  schemes  which  are comparable to those detailed in the Code, but also actively promotes compliance  (e.g.  through  enforcement  measures  such  as  the  application  of inspection standards and the utilization of arrangements with other jurisdictions for the exchange of information concerning investment management persons).

## Advance rulings

15. Where a scheme is of a kind referred to in paragraph 12 above and is widely held in terms of the test specified in paragraph 10, it may be accepted without confirmation from the Department that the scheme falls within section 26A(1A)(a)  (exemption  will,  however,  only  apply  if  section  26A(1A)(b)  is satisfied  -  see  paragraphs  17  and  18  below).    If,  on  the  other  hand,  such  a scheme  is  not  widely  held  in  terms  of  the  test,  the  application  of  section 26A(1A)(a)  cannot  be  presumed.    In  the  latter  situation,  a  request  may  be made to the Commissioner for a ruling on the question of whether it can be accepted that the requirements of the subsection are satisfied.    Such a request should be accompanied by information and relevant documentary evidence to support  the  contention  that  the  scheme  was  established  with  a  view  to  wide public participation (see paragraph 11 above) and to substantiate that it is of a

kind described in paragraph 12.    Please refer to Departmental Interpretation &amp; Practice Notes No. 31 on the procedures and requirements for making such an 'advance ruling'.

16. Applications for rulings may also be made to the Commissioner in respect of collective investment schemes which are not of a kind referred to in paragraph 12. An application in respect of such a case should be accompanied  by  material  sufficient  to  enable  the  Commissioner  to  decide whether  or  not  he  is  satisfied  that  the  scheme  meets  the  relevant  specified requirements discussed in paragraphs 10 to 14 above.

## Sums which qualify for exemption

'specified investment scheme'

17. The  scope  of  the  section  26A(1A)  exemption  is  limited  to  sums which  are  received  by  or  accrued  to  a  qualifying  person  in  respect  of  a 'specified  investment  scheme'. The  meaning  of  this  term  is  set  out  in paragraph (b) of that section.    In  essence,  the  term  applies  to  an  investment scheme which satisfies two requirements, namely -
2. (i) the investment scheme must be carried on for the purposes for which  it  was  stated  to  be  carried  on  in  the  constitutive documents approved by the relevant supervisory authority (i.e. by the SFC in the case of an authorized mutual fund, unit trust or similar investment scheme, or by the supervisory authority within  an  acceptable  regulatory  regime  in  the  case  of  a scheme which has not been authorized by the SFC but falls within subsection (1A)(a)(ii)); and
3. (ii) the investment scheme must be carried on in accordance with the  requirements  of  the  SFC  or  the  supervisory  authority within the acceptable regulatory regime, as the case may be.
18. It should be noted that as a consequence of the amendments made in 1998, section 26A(1A) no longer restricts exemption to specified categories of sums  derived  by  a  qualifying  fund.    Exemption  instead  hinges  on  the questions of whether a sum has been derived from an activity which has been

approved  by  the  relevant  supervisory  authority,  and  whether  the  activity  has been conducted in accordance with the requirements of the authority.
