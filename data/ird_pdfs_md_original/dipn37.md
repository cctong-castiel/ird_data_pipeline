## INTRODUCTION

## Background

The concessionary deduction for approved charitable donations was first introduced  by  the  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  Ordinance  1970  under  section 42(1).  After the enactment of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Ordinance 1998, the concessionary deduction for approved charitable donations made in a year of assessment by a person subject to salaries tax or personal assessment is allowable under section 26C which is now contained in Division 2 of Part 4A of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (IRO).

## APPROVED CHARITABLE DONATIONS

## Conditions for deduction

2. Section  26C  of  the  IRO  allows  a  deduction  for  approved  charitable donations made by a person during a year of assessment, subject to the fulfillment of the specified conditions.  The conditions for deduction of approved charitable donations under salaries tax or personal assessment are:
2. (a) the payment must be a donation;
3. (b) the donation must be a donation of money;
4. (c) the donation must be made to a charitable institution or trust of a public character which is exempt from tax under section 88 of the IRO, or to the Government;
5. (d) the donation must be for charitable purposes;
6. (e) the aggregate of the person's donations, including the donations of the person's spouse, not being a spouse living apart from the person, must not be less than $100;
7. (f) the allowable deduction in any year of assessment cannot exceed

35% 1  of the person's reduced assessable income or adjusted total income;

- (g) a deduction in respect of the same donation cannot be granted to more than one person; and
- (h) no  deduction  is  allowed  if  the  donation  has  been  allowed  under profits tax.

## Donations

3. In its ordinary sense, the word 'donation' means a gift.  A 'gift' is a transfer of property in a thing without any valuable consideration.  To constitute a gift, the property transferred must be transferred voluntarily and not as a result of a contractual  obligation  to  transfer  it.    Further,  the  transferor  cannot  receive  any benefit or advantage of a material character by way of return: Sanford Yung-tao Yung v Commissioner of Inland Revenue [1979] HKLR 429.  There is no provision in the IRO to permit payments to be apportioned into 'charitable' and 'material benefit' components.  If the person making the payment received a material benefit, the whole of the payment falls outside of the ambit of a gift because the condition that no material advantage may accrue to the donor, is breached.  Payments other than those which are strictly gifts are not donations for the purposes of section 26C.
4. Payments  that  fall  outside  the  categorisation  of  donations  include payments for grave spaces: see D54/11 (2012-13) 27 IRBRD 117, purchases of raffle tickets, admission fees to charity film shows and the cost of tickets for charity balls and concerts etc.  The receipt by the donor of a benefit which is minute in nature does not compromise the 'materiality' requirement to preclude the payment from  being  a  donation.    Benefits  received  by  donors  which  fall  within  the classification of 'minute' include badges, flags and other similar token acknowledgements of a donation.

## Donation of money

5. The term 'approved charitable donation' is defined in section 2 of the IRO.    It is a donation of money to:

1 10% for years of assessment up to the year of assessment 2002/03 and 25% for the years of assessment from 2003/04 to 2007/08 inclusive.

- (a) any charitable institution or trust of a public character that is exempt from tax under section 88 of the IRO; or
- (b) the Government,

for charitable purposes.

The donation must be one of money.  Deductions under section 26C cannot be allowed for the monetary value of any property (e.g. landed property or works of art) gifted to a charitable institution or trust of a public character.

## Tax-exempt charitable institution or trust of a public character

6. Voluntary  and  non-profit  making  organisations  are  not  necessarily charities.      There  are  many  clubs  and  societies  in  Hong  Kong  operating  on  a voluntary, non-profit making basis for the benefit of their members.  In some cases, section 24(1) of the IRO deems the clubs and similar institution not to be carrying on a business in Hong Kong.  They are not subject to profits tax because they fulfill the conditions specified in section 24(1) rather than being exempted under section 88 from the payment of tax.  Therefore, donations made to these organisations are not  approved  charitable  donations  within  the  meaning  of  the  IRO  and  not  tax deductible.
7. The Department is not responsible for registering charities in Hong Kong nor  does  the  Department  have  any  statutory  power  in  the  monitoring  of  their conducts.  Nevertheless, a charity may request the Department to recognise its tax exemption status accorded by section 88 of the IRO.  If a charity is tax exempted, donations made to it are, subject to the other qualifying conditions being satisfied, deductible to the donors for tax purposes.
8. For an institution or a trust to be a charity, the purposes for which the institution  or  trust  of  a  public  character  is  established  must  be  exclusively charitable.  It is not permissible for an institution or a trust of a public character to have  mixed  purposes,  some  of  which  are  charitable  and  others  which are  noncharitable.  The  decision  of  Lord  MacNaghten  in Commissioners  for  Special Purposes of Income Tax v Pemsel [1891] AC 531 summarises the purposes which are charitable as:

- (a) the relief of poverty;
- (b) the advancement of education;
- (c) the advancement of religion; or
- (d) any other purposes of a charitable nature beneficial to the community not falling under any of the preceding categories.

Any institution or trust of a public character whose purposes fall outside of  these parameters cannot be a charitable institution or trust of a public character for the purposes of section 88.

9. A purpose is not charitable unless it is for public benefit.  That is, there must be an identifiable benefit or benefits and the benefits must be to the public in general, or to a sufficient section of the public.  In general, an organisation cannot be classified as charitable if, in principle, it is established for the benefit of specific individuals.  It is not possible to lay down a precise rule as to what constitutes a sufficient section of the public.  Over the years, the Courts have considered various situations where charitable status was claimed.   Example of the Court decisions are summarised below.
2. (a) The following purposes are held to be charitable:
3. (i) relief of poor people;
4. (ii) relief of victims of a particular disaster;
5. (iii) relief of sickness;
6. (iv) relief of physically and mentally disabled;
7. (v) establishment or maintenance of non-profit-making schools;
8. (vi) provision of scholarships;
9. (vii)  diffusion of knowledge of particular academic subjects;

- (viii) establishment or maintenance of a church;
- (ix) establishment of religious institutions of a public character;
- (x) prevention of cruelty to animals;
- (xi) protection and safeguarding of the environment or countryside;
- (xii)  promotion of health.
- (b) The following purposes are not accepted to be charitable:
- (i) attainment of a political object;
- (ii) promotion of the benefits of the founders or subscribers;
- (iii) encouragement of a particular sport such as football or cycling;
- (iv) provision of a playing field, recreation ground or scholarship fund for employees of a particular company.
10. To facilitate members of the public in checking whether their donations to  an  organisation  will  qualify  for  tax  deduction,  with  the  consent  of  the organisations  concerned,  a  list  of  charitable  institutions  and  trusts  of  a  public character recognised by the Department as exempt from tax under section 88 of the IRO is uploaded to the Department's website and accessible at www.ird.gov.hk/eng/tax/ach\_index.htm .  It must be emphasised that the list does not  constitute  a  formal  register  of  charities.    Donors  should  check  with  donee organisations concerned if their names do not appear on the list.

## Minimum aggregate amount of donations

Not less than $100

11. Section  26C(1)  prescribes  that  a  deduction  for  approved  charitable donations may only be allowed where the aggregate amount of the donations made is not less than $100.  The 'aggregate' is the total amount of all approved charitable donations made by the person and the person's spouse in the year of assessment.

It is not necessary for every donation made by the person and the person's spouse to be not less than $100.  It is sufficient that the total of all approved charitable donations made in the year of assessment is not less than $100.

## Donations made by spouse

12. In section 2(1) of the IRO, 'spouse' is defined to mean a husband or wife whereas  'husband'  and  'wife'  refer  to  a  married  man  and  married  woman respectively.  'Marriage' is also defined in the same section to mean:
2. (a) any marriage recognized by the law of Hong Kong; or
3. (b) any marriage, whether or not so recognized, entered into outside Hong Kong according to the law of the place where it was entered into and between persons having the capacity to do so.

Based  on  the  above  definitions,  'marriage'  was  in  the  past  construed  as  a heterosexual  marriage  between  a  man  and  a  woman  and  parties  in  a  same-sex marriage would be incapable of having a 'spouse'.

13. In Leung  Chun  Kwong  v  Secretary  for  the  Civil  Service (2019)  22 HKCFAR 127, the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) recognized that the protection of the institution of marriage in Hong Kong, being heterosexual and monogamous, was a legitimate aim.  However, the differential treatment under the IRO between a person in a heterosexual marriage and a person in a same-sex marriage entered into outside Hong Kong was not rationally connected to the legitimate aim and was not justified.  As a relief, the CFA considered that a remedial interpretation of the IRO was appropriate and ordered the following declaration:
2. (a) the existing limb (b) of the term 'marriage' in section 2 of the IRO shall  be  read  as  'any  marriage,  whether  or  not  so  recognized, entered into outside Hong Kong according to the law of the place where it was entered into and between persons having the capacity to do so, provided where the persons are of the same sex and such a marriage  between  them  would  have  been  a  marriage  under  this Ordinance but for the fact only that they are persons of the same sex, they shall be deemed for the purposes of such a marriage to have the capacity to do so'; and

- (b) for the purposes of the IRO, references to:
- (i) 'husband and wife' shall be read as 'a married person and his or her spouse';
- (ii) 'not being a wife living apart from her husband' shall be read as 'not being a spouse living apart from the married person'; and
- (iii)  'either the husband or wife' shall be read as 'either the married person or his or her spouse'.

Therefore, a person, whether in a heterosexual marriage or same-sex marriage, is entitled to claim deduction in respect of the donations made by the person's spouse subject to the satisfaction of other conditions.

14. The definition of 'marriage' shall not, in the case of a marriage which is both potentially and actually polygamous, include marriage between a person and any spouse other than the principal spouse.  If a person has more than one legal spouse under the laws of other places which permit polygamous marriage, only the marriage  between  the  person  and  the  principal  spouse  is  recognized  for  the purposes of the IRO.  The person can only claim for deduction of the donations made by the person and the person's principal spouse.

## Maximum deduction

15. For any person chargeable to salaries tax, the maximum deduction that may  be  allowed  for  approved  charitable  donations  in  any  year  of  assessment commencing on or after 1 April 2008 cannot exceed 35% of the person's assessable income as reduced by his or her deductions for outgoings and expenses allowable under  section  12(1)(a),  and  depreciation  allowances  on  machinery  and  plant granted  under  section  12(1)(b)  (referred  to  as  'reduced  assessable  income' hereafter).

## Example 1

In the year of assessment 2018/19, Mr. A derived an income of $500,000 from his employment.   He incurred expenses of $7,000 in the production of his chargeable income.   Since Mr. A had to use plant and machinery in performing his duties, he was entitled to claim depreciation allowance of $3,000.   During the year of assessment 2018/19, Mr. A made charitable donations of $210,000 and claim for deduction of self-education expense of $20,000.

The approved charitable donations of $210,000 made by Mr. A during the year of assessment 2018/19 exceeded 35% of the reduced assessable income.  In computing the reduced assessable income for ascertaining the maximum amount of allowable approved charitable donations, the selfeducation expenses were not required to be deducted from the assessable income.  The  maximum amount of allowable  approved charitable donations  for  the  year  of  assessment  201 8 / 19 would  be  computed  as follows:

|                                         |                                            | $     | $       |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------|---------|
| Mr. A's salary income                   | Mr. A's salary income                      |       | 500,000 |
| Less:                                   | Deductible expenses - section 12(1)(a)     | 7,000 |         |
|                                         | Depreciation allowances - section 12(1)(b) | 3,000 | 10,000  |
| Reduced assessable income               | Reduced assessable income                  |       | 490,000 |
| Allowable approved charitable donations | Allowable approved charitable donations    |       | 171,500 |
| (i.e. reduced assessable income × 35%)  | (i.e. reduced assessable income × 35%)     |       |         |

16. If a married couple have elected under section 10(2) to be jointly assessed, the deduction for charitable donations cannot exceed 35% of their total reduced assessable income.

## Example 2

Same facts as in Example 1 except that Mr. A elected for joint assessment with  his  spouse.    Mr.  A's  spouse,  who  made  charitable  donation  of $30,000, had an assessable income of $100,000.

The aggregate of the approved charitable donations of $240,000 made by Mr. A and his spouse during the year of assessment 201 8 / 19 exceeded 35%  of  their  aggregate  reduced  assessable  income.    The  maximum amount  of  allowable  approved  charitable  donations  for  the  year  of assessment 201 8 / 19 would be computed as follows:

|                                                   | $       |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Mr. A's reduced assessable income (see example 1) | 490,000 |
| Spouse's reduced assessable income                | 100,000 |
| Total reduced assessable income                   | 590,000 |
| Allowable approved charitable donations           | 206,500 |
| (i.e. reduced assessable income × 35%)            |         |

17. If  personal  assessment  is  elected,  a  person  with  multiple  sources  of income (i.e. business profits, property rentals and salaries) cannot be allowed a deduction  for  approved  charitable  donations  exceeding  35%  of  the  person's adjusted total income.  The adjusted total income of a person is the total income of the person computed in accordance with section 42, increased by:
2. (a)    the  amount  of  the  approved  charitable  donations  allowed  in  the profits tax assessment under section 16D; and
3. (b)    self-education expenses allowed in the salaries tax assessment under section 12(1)(e).

The aggregate of the approved charitable donations allowed under section 26C and section 16D cannot exceed 35% of the person's total income, as adjusted, under personal assessment.

## Example 3

Same facts as in Example 1 but Mr. A had assessable profits of $97,000 which  were  arrived  at  after  deducting  charitable  donations  of  $3,000 under section 16D.  Mr. A elected for personal assessment.

In  computing the total adjusted income for ascertaining the maximum amount of allowable approved charitable donations, the self-education

expenses were not required to be deducted from the reduced assessable income;  and  the  charitable  donations  allowed  under  profits  tax  were added back to the assessable profits.  The maximum amount of allowable approved  charitable  donations under  personal  assessment of  Mr.  A  for the year of assessment 201 8 / 19 would be $203,500 which was computed as follows:

|                                                                                              | $       |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Mr. A's reduced assessable income (see example 1)                                            | 490,000 |
| Assessable profits                                                                           | 97,000  |
| Add: Charitable donations allowed under section 16D                                          | 3,000   |
| Total adjusted income                                                                        | 590,000 |
| Maximum amount of allowable approved charitable donations (i.e. total adjusted income × 35%) | 206,500 |
| Less: Charitable donations allowed under section 16D                                         | 3,000   |
| Allowable charitable donations under personal assessment                                     | 203,500 |

## Same donation claimed by different persons

18. In general, an approved charitable donation made by a person can only be claimed by that person.  The only exception relates to donations made by a married couple who are not living apart from each other.  For a married couple not living  apart  from  each  other,  a  spouse  may  claim  a  deduction  for  approved charitable donation made by the other spouse.   In no case can a deduction for the same donation be claimed by both of them.
19. Sections 33(2) and (3), dealing with allowances granted under Part 5 of the IRO, contain supplementary provisions to enable the Commissioner to resolve situations  where  two  or  more  persons  are  claiming,  or  have  been  allowed,  an allowance in respect of the same person, or it appears to the Commissioner that two or more persons are eligible to claim an allowance for the same person for that year.    Section  26C(3)(b)  provides  that  these  supplementary  provisions,  suitably modified, also apply to deductions for approved charitable donations. Where more than one person is claiming, or has been allowed, a deduction for an approved charitable donation, the Commissioner will invite the claimants to agree amongst themselves as to which of them will claim the deduction.  In the event that they are

unable to  reach  an  agreement,  the  Commissioner  will  allow  the  deduction  in  a manner  that,  having  regard  to  the  information  available  to  him,  is  just  in  the circumstances.

## Donations allowable under different assessment types

20. If a person who made an approved charitable donation is assessed under both profits tax and salaries tax, the person can only claim the deduction under either  section  16D  or  26C.    The  same  approved  charitable  donation  cannot  be claimed as a deduction under both profits tax and salaries tax.

## Review of deduction claim

21. After  the  raising  of  a  tax  assessment,  a  person  may  be  requested  to provide documentary evidence, such as the receipt issued by a charity, to prove that the deduction claim for a charitable donation has been properly made.
