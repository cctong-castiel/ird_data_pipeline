## INTRODUCTION

Section  16(1)  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  provides  that  in ascertaining  the  assessable  profits  for  any  year  of  assessment  there  shall  be deducted all outgoings and expenses to the extent to which they are incurred in the production of profits chargeable to tax.

2. Generally, an outgoing or expense is an allowable deduction if it is incurred in producing chargeable profits.    The words 'to the extent to which' signify  that  an  outgoing  or  expense  may  be  apportioned  if  it  is  only  partly incurred to produce chargeable profits. In CIR v. Cosmotron Manufacturing Co.  Ltd.  4  HKTC  562 ,  Lord  Nolan  at  the  Privy  Council  observed  that  the phrase 'for the purposes of the trade' adopted in the United Kingdom Income and  Corporation  Taxes  Act  1988  has  generally  been  interpreted  in  a  manner consistent with the words 'in the production of profits'.

## THE PRINCIPLES

3. In Ronpibon Tin (NL) v. FCT 4 AITR 236 , it was recognized that two kinds  of  expenditure  require  apportionment.    The  first  is  expenditure  in respect  of  a  matter  where  distinct  and  severable  parts  are  devoted  to  making profits  and  other  parts  are  devoted  to  some  other  end. The  second  kind  of apportionable expenditure is a single outlay that serves both the profit making purpose and some other purpose indifferently.
4. Godfrey J agreed in Anthony Patrick Fahy trading as A.P. Fahy &amp; Co.  v.  CIR 3 HKTC 695 that  if  an  outgoing  or  expense  had  a  dual  purpose, partly of a domestic or private nature and partly for business purpose, it was not  allowable  to  the  extent  that  the  outgoing  or  expense  was  a  domestic  or private character. He ruled that there could not be any sensible apportionment of medical expenses if those elements of the purpose could not be distinguished and the expense was one indivisible matter.
5. In CIR v. Hang Seng Bank Ltd. 3 HKTC 351, Lord Bridge said that if a  taxpayer  derived  profits  partly  within  Hong  Kong  and  partly  outside  Hong Kong, the gross offshore profits should be scaled down to bear their fair share of the general expenses of the business.
6. In  an  apportionment,  the  objective  is  to  find  a  basis  which  is reasonable and equitable. Whilst the method adopted by an Assessor is open to  objection  and  appeal,  the  taxpayer  has  to  adduce  primary  documents  in support that the expenditure was truly incurred in the production of chargeable profits. Ledgers  are  secondary  and  not  primary  documents  per  Chu  J  in SO Kai-tong, Stanley trading as Stanley So &amp; Co. v. CIR 6 HKTC 38 .

## SPECIFIC EXPENDITURES

7. Research and development payments or expenditures are apportioned under section 16B(2) where the relevant payments or expenditures are made or incurred outside Hong Kong and the trade is carried on partly in and partly out of Hong Kong. Expenditures on patent rights are apportioned under  section  16E(2)  where  the  rights  are  purchased  partly  for  use  in  and outside Hong Kong. The deduction allowable will be determined after having regard to the extent of the use in Hong Kong. Apportionment of expenditure on  prescribed  fixed  assets  is  required  by  section  16G(2)  where  the  asset  is partly used in the production of chargeable profits.

## INLAND REVENUE RULES

8. Rules  2A,  2B  and  2C  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Rules  provide  the methods  for  apportionment  of  expenses  in  general,  interest  and  management expenses in relation to the holding of share investments. Under Rules 2A, 2B and 2C, apportionment should be made on a basis that is most reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances of the case. Apportionment can be based on turnover, gross profit, income or assets.
9. The  following  methods  adopted  in  practice  are  largely  based  on Rules 2A, 2B and 2C:
- (a) If  trading  profits  are  derived  partly  within  Hong  Kong  and partly  outside  Hong  Kong,  expenses  directly  attributable  to the  profits  arising  outside  Hong  Kong  are  to  be  disallowed and an apportionment will be made of such expenses as are partly one and partly the other. The basis of such

apportionment  may  be  on  turnover  or  gross  profit  or  such basis as is most appropriate to the activities of the trade.

- (b) If  profits  are  derived  from  trading  and  also  from  share investments in the form of dividends, then -
    - (i) interest on money borrowed and used for the purpose of acquiring the share investments is not allowable for deduction; and
    - (ii) administration  and  general  expenses  as  applicable  to the receipt of the non-taxable dividends are allowable for deduction unless the extent of activities involved in the  management  and  supervision  of  the  investment portfolio  and  the  collection  of  dividends  is  relatively appreciable.
- (c) Apart from any other profit earning activities, if the person is engaged in share dealing, then -
    - (i) no attempt is made to split any interest paid in respect of the share investments and the whole sum is allowed as  against  the  profits  arising  from  the  buying  and selling of stocks and shares and no portion is treated as applicable  to  the  earning  of  the  non-taxable  profits from dividends; and
    - (ii) a  small  fraction  of  such  expenses  in  supervision  and management will normally be disallowed as applicable to  the  earning  of  the  non-taxable  dividends  since  the portfolio in these case, which would involve time and expense, is large.
- (d) Where  there  is  a  substantial  investment  portfolio,  which would  involve  a  degree  of  supervision  and  management  as well  as  clerical  and  accounting  records,  it  is  a  question  of ascertaining the direct expenses and of allocating a proportion of  the  management,  clerical  and  general  expenses  properly

attributable to those activities. Unless a more suitable basis is available, Rule 2C provides for taking a percentage of the total cost of the portfolio as the measure of the disallowable expenses. The percentage is not to exceed -

    - (i) 1/8% where the investments are held at least partly for share dealing purposes;
    - (ii) 1/2% in other cases.
