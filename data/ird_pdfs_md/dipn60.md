## THE AUTHORISED OECD APPROACH

### The working hypothesis

The Authorised OECD Approach (the AOA) is a working hypothesis. It  is  a  functionally  separate  entity  approach  and  not  a  single  entity  approach. It is a two-step approach to attribute profits:

- (a) use functional and factual analysis to hypothesize the permanent establishment as a distinct and separate enterprise;
- (b) apply  the  arm's  length  principle  to  the  hypothetical  enterprise  in accordance with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multilateral Enterprises and Tax Administrations (the TPG) by analogy.

Under  the  first  step,  assets  and  risks  are  attributed  to  location  of  Key Entrepreneurial Risk-Taking (KERT)  functions and capital follows risk. KERT  functions  require  active,  day-to-day  decision  making  regarding  the assumption of risk and ongoing management of risk.    Under the second step, there is equality of treatment (i.e. the same principles) not equality of outcome as branch and subsidiary are economically different.

2. Under  the  AOA,  where  dealings  are  capable  of  being  recognized, they  should  be  priced  on  an  arm's  length  basis,  assuming  the  permanent establishment  and  the  rest  of  the  enterprise  of  which  it  is  a  part  to  be independent  of  one  another.    It  does  not  limit  a  profit  to  the  permanent establishment even when the enterprise as a whole has incurred losses.

### Applying guidance in the TPG by analogy

3. The AOA is to apply the guidance given in the TPG not directly but by  analogy.    The  aim  of  the  AOA  is  not  to  achieve  equality  of  outcome between  a  permanent  establishment  and  a  subsidiary  in  terms  of  profits  but rather to apply to dealings among separate parts of a single enterprise the same transfer pricing principles that apply to transactions between  associated enterprises.    There  are  generally  economic  differences  between  using  a subsidiary and a permanent establishment.    Application of the AOA will not

achieve equality of outcome between subsidiaries and permanent establishments where there are economic differences between them.

### The AOA and the business profits article

4. While  some  tax  jurisdictions  might  take  the  view  that  the  AOA should not apply unless the double taxation agreement or arrangement (DTA) was concluded with  the  AOA  in  mind  (i.e.  the  business  profits  article  is  the same as that  contemplated  by  the  AOA),  the  AOA  is  often  applied  to  DTAs entered into before the AOA was in existence since the AOA has a pervasive influence due to the level of detail of guidance provided in 2010 Report on the Attribution  of  Profits  to  Permanent  Establishments (the  2010  Report).    If  a DTA territory resident person disagrees to the attribution of profits or losses in accordance with the AOA, the mutual agreement procedure provided under the relevant DTA can be used to resolve the issue.

### KERT Function/ SPF Concept

5. The AOA relies on the KERT function/ Significant People Function (SPF)  concept  since  financial  assets  and  risks  are  not  segregated  from  each other within the single legal entity in an intra-enterprise scenario.    The KERT function/  SPF  concept  has  been  developed  to  help  allocating  the  balance  of activity  between  the  permanent  establishment  and  the  remainder  of  the enterprise based on where the people controlling the asset/ risk are located.
6. The  KERT  function/  SPF  concept  relates  to  the  active  day-to-day decision makers and management, rather than the formalizing of the outcome of decision making.    KERT function/ SPF refers to functions performed below the strategic level of senior management and often middle management, but it depends  on  decision  making  process  within  the  enterprise.    In  a  banking  or financial markets context, a KERT function is the function which accepts the financial risk and undertakes ongoing management of that financial risk.
7. In  short,  Part  II  of  the  2010  Report  (Banks)  prescribes  a  KERT function as the function which accepts and undertakes ongoing management of credit  risk  while  Part  III  of  the  2010  Report  (Global  Trading  of  Financial Instruments)  prescribes  a  KERT  function  as  acceptance  and  management  of key market risks on instrument with an emphasis on ongoing risk management.

8. Split  KERT  function  may  arise  where  a  KERT  function  can  be identified  in  more  than  one  single  location  (e.g.  credit  committee  spread between entity and branch jurisdictions). Though the nature of risk management  may  be  dynamic,  split  KERT  functions  may  not  result  in  split assets.    Usually it is possible to identify a location with the majority of KERT functions.    Economically the contribution of the other KERT functions can be recognized through a profit/ revenue split or through an arm's length price for the dealing with the other part of the enterprise.

### Permanent establishment's accounts and books

9. The  assets  and  risks  recorded  in  the  accounts  and  books  of  the permanent  establishment  form  a  practical starting point for  determining whether  the  economic  ownership  of  assets  has  been  assigned  to  the  location where the KERT functions were performed.    The accounts and books should be respected for tax purposes if they reflect an attribution of assets and risks that  is  consistent  with  the  functional  and  factual  analysis.    There  may, however,  be  cases  where  the  accounts  and  records  are  inconsistent  with  the functional  and  factual  analysis  (e.g.  material  amounts  of  financial  assets  and risks  may  be  booked  in  a  location  where  none,  or  very  few,  of  the  KERT functions related to their creation or subsequent management were performed). Respecting  the  booking  location  in  such  cases  would  not  lead  to  an  arm's length attribution of profit.
10. The assets and risks of the permanent establishment are attributed by reference  to  a  functional  and  factual  analysis,  especially  the  identification  of the KERT functions for assets.    This analysis may be performed at the level of portfolios of similar assets and risks, rather than for each individual asset and risk.

## HONG KONG'S ATTRIBUTION RULES

### Permanent establishment as defined in DTA or Schedule 17G

11. Rule 2 in section 50AAK requires the income or loss of a non-Hong Kong resident person  attributable  to  the  person's  permanent  establishment  in Hong Kong to be determined as if the permanent establishment were a distinct

and  separate  enterprise.    Neither  the  AOA  nor  the  provisions  in  section 50AAK would change the rules that define a permanent establishment.    If the non-Hong Kong resident person is a tax resident of a jurisdiction which has a DTA with Hong Kong, it is necessary to refer to the relevant DTA to determine whether the non-Hong Kong resident person has a permanent establishment in Hong Kong.    If the non-Hong Kong resident person is not a tax resident of a jurisdiction which has a DTA with Hong Kong, it is necessary to refer to Part 3 of Schedule 17G to determine whether the non-Hong Kong resident person has a permanent establishment in Hong Kong.

### Permanent establishment deemed carrying on business

12. If a non-Hong Kong resident person has a permanent establishment in Hong Kong, the non-Hong Kong resident person is regarded as carrying on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong for the purposes of charging profits tax  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  section  50AAK(1).    However,  if  a non-Hong Kong resident person does not have a permanent establishment in Hong Kong, it does  not  necessarily  follow  that  the  non-Hong  Kong  resident person is not carrying on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong or does not  have  profits  chargeable  to  profits  tax.    In  such  cases,  whether  the non-Hong Kong resident person is carrying on business would depend on the facts and circumstances.
13. Profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong in respect of a business carried  on  in  Hong  Kong  by  a  non-DTA  territory  resident  person,  without  a permanent establishment in Hong Kong, remain chargeable to profits tax under section 14.    Chargeability to profits tax under section 14 does not depend on having a permanent establishment in Hong Kong.    Provisions under sections 16 and 17 will continue applicable to any deduction claims.

## RULE 2: SEPARATE ENTERPRISES PRINCPLE FOR ATTRIBUTING INCOME OR LOSS

### Basic premise of Rule 2

14. Section 50AAK(2) provides that the income or loss of a non-Hong Kong resident person that is attributable  to  a  permanent  establishment  of  the

person in Hong Kong are those that the permanent establishment would have made in circumstances where it were a distinct and separate enterprise that:

- (a) engaged  in  the  same  or  similar  activities  under  the  same  or similar conditions; and
- (b) dealt wholly independently with the person.

The amount of income or loss of the person that is attributed to the permanent establishment in accordance with section 50AAK(2) is referred to as the arm's length amount.

15. In the attribution of income or loss, section 50AAK(3) provides that account is to be taken of the functions performed, assets used and risk assumed by the person:
- (a) through the permanent establishment; and
- (b) through the other parts of the person.
16. As  required under section 50AAK(4),  it is assumed  that the permanent establishment:
- (a) has the same credit rating as the person; and
- (b) has  the  equity  and  loan  capital  that  it  could  reasonably  be expected  to  have  in  the  circumstances  set  out  in  section 50AAK(2).
17. Each  dealing  between  the  permanent  establishment  and  any  other part of the person is treated as taking place on the terms that would have been agreed between parties dealing at arm's length.    No deduction is to be allowed for costs and expenses in excess of those that would have been incurred on the assumptions set out in section 50AAK(4).

### Notice and assessment process

18. Section  50AAK(7)  provides  that  the  Assessor  may  give  a  notice requiring  the  person  to  state  the  amount  of  income  or  loss  attributed  to  the permanent  establishment  and  prove  that  the  amount  of  income  or  loss  so attributed is the arm's length amount.
19. Section  50AAK(9) provides that if  the  person  fails  to  prove  to  the Assessor's satisfaction that the amount of income or loss attributed is the arm's length  amount,  the  Assessor  must  estimate  an  amount  as  the  arm's  length amount and, taking into account the estimated amount:
- (a) make an assessment or additional assessment on the person; or
- (b) issue  a  computation  of  loss,  or  revise  a  computation  of  loss resulting in a smaller amount of computed loss, in respect of the person.
20. Section 50AAK(10) provides that the estimated amount is taken to be the arm's length amount unless the person proves that another amount is an equally  reliable  measure,  or  a  more  reliable  measure,  of  the  arm's  length amount.    The combined effect of section 50AAK(7) and (9) should enable the Assessor  to  make  an  upward  adjustment  if  the  amount  attributed  to  the permanent establishment in Hong Kong is not an arm's length amount.

### Protection of revenue base

21. Section  50AAK  aims  to  prevent  under-attribution  of  income  or over-attribution  of  loss  to  a  non-Hong  Kong  resident  person's  permanent establishment in Hong Kong.    It is not to be used to achieve double deduction or  double  non-taxation.    The  notice  and  assessment  mechanism  in  section 50AAK(9)  allows  the  Assessor  to  make  upward  adjustments.    Downward adjustments would only be considered by way of corresponding relief under the terms of the relevant DTA.

22. While  there  may  be  difficulties  in  obtaining  information  about  the profits  of  a  non-Hong  Kong  resident  person  under  the  domestic  information powers, such information would fall within the scope of domestic information powers if the non-Hong Kong resident person has a permanent establishment in Hong Kong.    The Assessor can also make use of the exchange of information mechanism to obtain such information.

### Consistency with the AOA

23. Section 50AAE requires, among other things, that sections 50AAK and 50AAO are to be construed in a way that best secures consistency with the OECD rules.    The  OECD  rules  refer  to  the  Commentary  on  the  associated enterprises article or the business profits article (as the case requires) contained in the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (the MTC) and the TPG.
24. The  inclusion  of  the  adverb  'best'  in  the  equivocal  phrase  'best secures consistency' recognizes that:
- (a) there  might  be  a  choice  between  two  or  more  approaches  to the identification of the arm's length amount; and
- (b) when determining the effect given to section 50AAK, it might not  be  possible  to  arrive  at  an  attribution  of  profits  that achieves total consistency with the relevant OECD rules.

Therefore, the approach which achieves the highest level of consistency with the OECD rules is to be preferred.

### Interaction with source rules

25. The broad guiding principle as explained in Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 21 would not be affected as a result of the enactment of Rule 2 in Part 8AA.    Rule 2 requires the attribution of profits of a  non-Hong  Kong  resident  person  to  its  permanent  establishment  in  Hong Kong as if the permanent establishment were a distinct and separate enterprise, taking into account the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the  non-Hong  Kong  resident  person  through  the  permanent  establishment.

After the attribution of profits to the permanent establishment in Hong Kong, the broad guiding principle would be applied to determine whether and, if so, the extent such profits should be taxed.    In deciding the source of profits, the broad  guiding  principle  is  to  see  what  has  been  done  to  earn  the  profits  in question  and  where  the  operations  have  been  performed.    The  two-step approach should not conflict with OECD's Actions 8-10 - 2015 Final Reports : it  is  expected  that  profits  will  be  reported  where  the  economic  activities  that generate them are carried out and where value is created.

## THE BUSINESS PROFITS ARTICLE AND THE 2010 REPORT

### Principles explained in the business profits article

26. As far as Rule 2 is concerned, the general application of the separate and independent enterprise principle is succinctly summarized in the business profits article of the MTC which states that:
- '1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated  therein.    If  the  enterprise  carries  on  business  as aforesaid,  the  profits  that  are  attributable  to  the  permanent establishment in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 may be taxed in that other State.
- For the purposes of this Article and Article [23 A] [23 B], the profits  that  are  attributable  in  each  Contracting  State  to  the permanent  establishment  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  are  the profits  it  might  be  expected  to  make,  in  particular  in  its dealings with other parts of the enterprise, if it were a separate and  independent  enterprise  engaged  in  the  same  or  similar activities  under  the  same  or  similar  conditions,  taking  into account the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the enterprise through the permanent establishment and through the other parts of the enterprise.'

### Determination of profits as explained in the Commentary

27. Paragraphs 11, 12, 15, 16 and 17 of the Commentary on the business profits article explain as follows:
- '11. The first principle underlying paragraph 1, i.e. that the profits of an enterprise of one Contracting State shall not be taxed in the other State unless the enterprise carries on business in that other State through a permanent establishment situated therein, has a long history and reflects the international consensus that, as  a  general  rule,  until  an  enterprise  of  one  State  has  a permanent establishment in another State, it should not properly  be  regarded  as  participating  in  the  economic  life  of that  other  State  to  such  an  extent  that  the  other  State  should have taxing rights on its profits.
- The second principle, which is reflected in the second sentence of the paragraph, is that the right to tax of the State where the permanent establishment is situated does not extend to profits that the enterprise may derive from that State but that are not attributable to the permanent establishment. This is a question on which there have historically been differences of view,  a  few  countries  having  some  time  ago  pursued  a principle  of  general  'force  of  attraction'  according  to  which income such as other business profits, dividends, interest and royalties  arising  from  sources  in  their  territory  was  fully taxable by them if the beneficiary had a permanent establishment therein even though such income was clearly not attributable  to  that  permanent  establishment.    Whilst  some bilateral tax conventions include a limited anti-avoidance rule based  on  a  restricted  force  of  attraction  approach  that  only applies  to  business  profits  derived  from  activities  similar  to those  carried  on  by  a  permanent  establishment,  the  general force  of  attraction  approach  described  above  has  now  been rejected in international tax treaty practice.    The principle that is  now  generally  accepted  in  double  taxation  conventions  is based  on  the  view  that  in  taxing  the  profits  that  a  foreign enterprise derives from a particular country, the tax authorities of  that  country  should  look  at  the  separate  sources  of  profit

- that the enterprise derives from their country and should apply to  each the permanent  establishment  test, subject to the possible application of other Articles of the Convention. ….
15. Paragraph  2  provides  the  basic  rule  for  the  determination  of the profits that are attributable to a permanent establishment. According  to  the  paragraph,  these  profits  are  the  profits  that the  permanent establishment  might be expected to  make  if it were  a  separate  and  independent  enterprise  engaged  in  the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, taking  into  account  the  functions  performed,  assets  used  and risks assumed through the permanent establishment and through other parts of the enterprise. In addition, the paragraph  clarifies  that  this  rule  applies  with  respect  to  the dealings  between  the  permanent  establishment  and  the  other parts of the enterprise.
16. The  basic  approach  incorporated  in  the  paragraph  for  the purposes of determining what are the profits that are attributable  to  the  permanent  establishment  is  therefore  to require  the  determination  of  the  profits  under  the  fiction  that the  permanent  establishment  is  a  separate  enterprise  and  that such an enterprise is independent from the rest of the enterprise of which it is a part as well as from any other person. The second part of that fiction corresponds to the arm's length principle  which  is  also  applicable,  under  the  provisions  of Article 9, for the purpose of adjusting the profits of associated enterprises (see paragraph 1 of the Commentary on Article 9).
17. Paragraph 2 does not seek to allocate the overall profits of the whole enterprise to the permanent establishment and its other parts  but,  instead,  requires  that  the  profits  attributable  to  a permanent establishment be determined as if it were a separate enterprise.    Profits may therefore be attributed to a permanent establishment even though the enterprise as a whole has never made  profits.    Conversely,  paragraph  2  may  result  in  no profits  being  attributed  to  a  permanent  establishment  even though the enterprise as a whole has made profits.'

### Detailed guidance provided in the 2010 Report

28. It  is  clear  that  the  business  profits  article,  as  currently  worded, reflects the approach developed in the 2010 Report adopted by the Committee on  Fiscal Affairs in 2010. The  2010  Report  dealt  primarily  with  the application  of  the  separate  and  independent  enterprise  fiction  that  underlies paragraph 2 of the business profits article.    The main purpose of the changes made  to  that  paragraph  following  the  adoption  of  the  2010  Report  was  to ensure  that  the  determination  of  the  profits  attributable  to  a  permanent establishment  followed  the  approach  put  forward  in  that  report.    The  2010 Report therefore provides a detailed guide as to how the profits attributable to a permanent establishment should be determined under the provisions of paragraph 2 of the business profits article.
29. The attribution  of  profits  to  a  permanent  establishment  will  follow from the calculation of the profits or losses from all its activities, including:
- (a) transactions with independent enterprises;
- (b) transactions with associated enterprises (with direct application of the TPG); and
- (c) dealings with other parts of the enterprise.
30. This  analysis  involves  the  two  steps  described  in  the  2010  Report. The order of the listing of items within each of these two steps is not meant to be prescriptive,  as  the  various  items  may  be  interrelated  (e.g.  risk  is  initially attributed to a permanent establishment as it performs the SPF relevant to the assumption of that risk but the recognition and characterization of a subsequent dealing between the permanent establishment and another part of the enterprise that manages the risk may lead to a transfer of the risk and supporting capital to the other part of the enterprise).
31. Under the first step, a functional and factual analysis is undertaken which will lead to:
- (a) the attribution to the permanent establishment, as appropriate, of the rights and obligations arising out of transactions between the enterprise of which the permanent establishment is a part and separate enterprises;
- (b) the identification of SPFs  relevant to the attribution of economic ownership of assets, and the attribution of economic ownership of assets to the permanent establishment;
- (c) the identification of SPFs relevant to the assumption of risks, and the attribution of risks to the permanent establishment;
- (d) the identification of other functions of the permanent establishment;
- (e) the  recognition  and  determination  of  the  nature  of  those dealings between the permanent establishment and other parts of  the  same  enterprise  that  can  appropriately  be  recognized, having  passed  the  threshold  test  referred  to  in  paragraph  34; and
- (f) the attribution of capital based on the assets and risks attributed to the permanent establishment.
32. Under the second step, any transactions with associated enterprises attributed  to  the  permanent  establishment  are  priced  in  accordance  with  the guidance of the TPG and these guidelines are applied by analogy to dealings between the permanent establishment and the other parts of the enterprise of which it is a part.    The process involves the pricing on an arm's length basis of these recognized dealings through:
- (a) the  determination  of  comparability  between  the  dealings  and uncontrolled  transactions,  established  by  applying  the  TPG's comparability  factors  directly  (characteristics  of  property  or services,  economic  circumstances  and  business  strategies)  or by analogy (functional analysis, contractual terms) in light of the particular factual circumstances of the permanent establishment; and

- (b) the  application  by  analogy  of  one  of  the  TPG's  methods  to arrive at an arm's length compensation  for  the dealings between the permanent establishment and the other parts of the enterprise, taking into account the functions performed by and the assets and risks attributed to the permanent establishment and the other parts of the enterprise.

### Attributing funding costs to p e rmanent establishments

33. A  key  feature  of  the  AOA  as  it  applies  to  funding  costs  is  that  it moves  the  focus  away  from  the  recognition  of  dealings  as  such  to  a  wider consideration of determining an allowable interest deduction for the permanent establishment.    The  objective  of  the  AOA  is  to  establish,  using  one  of  the authorised approaches described below, an arm's length amount of interest in the permanent establishment, commensurate with the functions, assets and risks attributed.    Whilst movements of funds between parts of the enterprise do not necessarily  give  rise  to  dealings,  there  would  be  circumstances  where  they could be recognized as internal interest dealings within non-financial enterprises,  for  the  purposes  of  rewarding  a  treasury  function.    The  tracing approach and the fungibility approach are in principle the two other approaches for  attributing  the  external  interest  expense  of  the  enterprise  to  its  permanent establishment.

### Documentation regarding dealings

34. Dealings between the permanent establishment and other parts of the enterprise of which it is a part have no legal consequences for the enterprise as a whole.    Thus, there is a need for greater scrutiny of these dealings than of transactions between two associated enterprises.    Considering the uniqueness of the nature of a dealing, enterprises should be able to demonstrate clearly that it would be appropriate to recognize the dealing (e.g. an accounting record and contemporaneous documentation showing a dealing that transfers economically significant risks, responsibilities and benefits would be a useful starting point for  the  purposes  of  attributing  profits).    Effect  would  be  given  to  such documentation to the extent that:

- (a) the  documentation is consistent with  the  economic  substance of the activities taking place within the enterprise as revealed by the functional and factual analysis;
- (b) the arrangements documented  in  relation to the dealing, viewed in their entirety, do not differ from those which would have  been  adopted  by  comparable  independent  enterprises behaving in a commercially rational manner, or if they do, the structure as presented in the documentation does not practically impede the Assessor from determining an appropriate transfer price; and
- (c) the dealing presented in the documentation does not violate the principles of the approach put forward in the 2010 Report (e.g. purporting to transfer risks in a way that segregates them from functions).

### Master file and local file

35. Section  58C  applies  to  a  Hong  Kong  entity  of  a  group  in  the extended sense.    The  term  'Hong  Kong  entity'  includes  a  constituent  entity that  is  a  permanent  establishment  in  Hong  Kong  while  the  term  'group  in extended sense' covers a single enterprise with business carried out through a permanent  establishment  in  a  jurisdiction  other  than  its  jurisdiction  of  tax residence.    Hence,  the  provisions  in  section  58C  and  Schedule  17I,  which relate to the keeping of master file and local file, equally apply to a permanent establishment subject to exemption thresholds.
36. Though the exemption conditions are met, a permanent establishment should consider having transfer pricing documentation in place that addresses the activities undertaken in Hong  Kong  since  having  a permanent  establishment  in  Hong  Kong  would  result  in  the  attribution  of profits to the permanent establishment in Hong Kong.

## PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT

### Definition of permanent establishment

37. For  a  DTA  territory  resident  person,  the  permanent  establishment status is to be determined in accordance with the relevant provisions under the relevant DTA.    For a non-DTA territory resident person, the question is to be determined in accordance with Part 3 of Schedule 17G.
38. The  definition  of  permanent  establishment  provided  in  Part  3  of Schedule  17G  is  consistent  with  and  has  the  same  broad  effect  with  the permanent establishment article of the MTC.    In essence, a non-DTA territory resident person has a permanent establishment in Hong Kong if it has a fixed place of business in Hong Kong through which the business of the enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.

### Fixed place of business

39. A fixed place of business includes, but not limited to:
- (a) a place of management;
- (b) a branch;
- (c) an office;
- (d) a factory;
- (e) a workshop; and
- (f) a  mine,  an  oil  or  gas  well,  a  quarry  or  any  other  place  of extraction of natural resources.
40. The  term  'place  of  business'  covers  any  premises,  facilities  or installations used for carrying on the business of the enterprise whether or not they are used exclusively for that purpose.    A place of business may also exist where no premises are available or required for carrying on the business of the enterprise and it simply has a certain amount of space at its disposal, regardless

of  whether  the  place  is  owned  or  rented  by  it.    Whether  a  location  may  be considered  to  be  at  the  disposal  of  an  enterprise  in  such  way  that  it  may constitute a 'place of business through which the business of that enterprise is wholly or partly carried on' will depend on that enterprise having the effective power to use that location as well as the extent of the presence of the enterprise at that location and the activities that it performs there.

41. The place of business must be fixed.    Two critical components will be considered:
- (a) a  certain  degree  of  permanence  at  geographical  point  (the duration test); and
- (b) a specific geographical point (the location test).
42. A permanent establishment can be deemed to exist only if the place of  business  has  a  certain  degree  of  permanency  (i.e.  if  it  is  not  of  a  purely temporary nature).    A place of business may, however, constitute a permanent establishment even though it exists, in practice, only for a very short period of time because the nature of the business is such that it will only be carried on for that short period of time.
43. The  place  of  business  of  an  enterprise  has  to  be  a  'fixed'  one. However, there  may be difficulties  in  determining  a  single  place  of  business where  business  activities  are  moved  between  locations.    A  single  place  of business will generally be considered to exist where, in light of the nature of the business, a particular location within which the activities are moved may be identified  as  constituting  a  coherent  whole  commercially  and  geographically with  respect  of  the  business.    The  concept  of  commercial  and  geographical coherence may be illustrated by a consulting firm that regularly rents different areas or rooms in a shared office.
44. For a building site or construction or installation project, it will be regarded as a permanent establishment of an enterprise (subject enterprise) if:
- (a) the  subject  enterprise  has  carried  on  activities  at  the  site  or project for a period of more than 12 months 1 ; or
- (b) all of the following apply:
    - (i) the subject enterprise has carried on activities at the site or project for a period that exceeds, or 2 or more periods that in the aggregate exceed, 30 days;
    - (ii) connected  activities  have  been  carried  on  at  the  site  or project by one or more closely related enterprises of the subject enterprise for one or more different periods that each exceeds 30 days;
    - (iii) all the periods referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) in the aggregate exceed 12 months.
45. In  determining  whether  different  activities  are  connected  for  the purposes  mentioned  in  the  preceding  paragraph,  regard  is  to  be  had  to  the actual facts and circumstances of the case, including in particular:
- (a) whether  the  contracts  covering  the  different  activities  were concluded with the same person or closely related persons;
- (b) whether the conclusion of additional contracts with a person is a  logical  consequence  of  a  previous  contract  concluded  with the person or closely related persons;
- (c) whether  the  activities  would  have  been  covered  by  a  single contract absent tax planning considerations;
- (d) whether  the  nature  of  the  work  involved  under  the  different contracts is the same or similar; and
- (e) whether  the  same  employees  are  performing  the  activities under the different contracts.

1 The  term  'month'  is  defined  in  the  Interpretation  and  General  Clauses  Ordinance  (Cap.  1)  as 'calendar  month'.    The  guidelines  provided  in  the  Commentary  on  permanent  establishment article at pages 129 to 132 of the MTC will be followed for counting the periods.

### Preparatory or auxiliary activities

46. While  an  enterprise  has  a  fixed  place  of  business  in  Hong  Kong through  which  the  business  of  the  enterprise  is  carried  on,  it  will  not  be regarded as having a permanent establishment in Hong Kong if the activities performed  by  the  enterprise  are  merely  preparatory  or  auxiliary.    Subject  to the complementary function test, if either set of the following conditions is met, the  enterprise  will  not  be  regarded  as  having  a  permanent  establishment  in Hong Kong.

#### The 1st set of conditions

- (a) the  activity  carried  on  for  the  enterprise  through  the  place consists solely of one of the following:
    - (i) the  use  of  facilities  solely  for  the  purpose  of  storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandize belonging to the enterprise;
    - (ii) the  maintenance  of  a  stock  of  goods  or  merchandize belonging  to  the  enterprise  solely  for  the  purpose  of storage, display or delivery;
    - (iii) the  maintenance  of  a  stock  of  goods  or  merchandize belonging  to  the  enterprise  solely  for  the  purpose  of processing by another enterprise;
    - (iv) the  maintenance  of  a  fixed  place  of  business  solely  for the  purpose  of  purchasing  goods  or  merchandize,  or collecting information, for the enterprise;
    - (v) the  maintenance  of  a  fixed  place  of  business  solely  for the  purpose  of  carrying  on  any  other  activity  for  the enterprise; and
- (b) in  relation  the  business  of  the  enterprise  as  a  whole,  the activity is of a preparatory or auxiliary character.

#### The 2nd set of conditions

- (a) the  activities  carried  on  for  the  enterprise  through  the  place consist solely of any combination of the activities mentioned in subparagraph (a) of the 1st set of conditions; and
- (b) the overall activity of the place resulting from the combination of the activities is of a preparatory or auxiliary character.
47. Generally, an activity is of preparatory character if it is carried on in contemplation  of the carrying on of what  constitutes the essential  and significant part of the activity of the enterprise as a whole. Since  a preparatory activity precedes another activity, it will often be carried on during a relatively short period of time, the duration of that period being determined by the nature of the core activities of the enterprise.    An activity is of auxiliary character  if  it  corresponds  to  an  activity  that  is  carried  on  to  support  the essential and significant part of the activity of the enterprise as a whole.    It is unlikely that an activity  that requires a significant proportion of the assets or employees  of  the  enterprise  could  be  considered  as  having  an  auxiliary character.

## ARTIFICIAL AVOIDANCE OF PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT

### Fragmentation of activities between closely related parties

48. The anti-fragmentation rule is to prevent an enterprise and its closely related enterprises from fragmenting a cohesive business operation into several small operations in order to argue that each is merely engaged in a preparatory or auxiliary activity.    For this rule to apply, either place A or place B where these activities are exercised must constitute a permanent establishment or the overall  activity  resulting  from  the  combination  of  the  relevant  activities  goes beyond what is merely preparatory or auxiliary.
49. Under the rule, where the activities carried on at a place (place A) and  other  activities  of  the  same  enterprise  or  a  closely  related  enterprise,  as defined  in  section  2  of  Part  1  of  Schedule  17G,  exercised  at  that  place  or another place in Hong Kong (place B) constitute complementary functions that

are part of a cohesive business operation, the exceptions relating to preparatory or auxiliary activities are not applicable.

### Complementary functions

50. The exceptions relating to preparatory or auxiliary activities do not apply if:
- (a) either or both of the following apply-
    - (i) business activities at place A are carried on by a closely related enterprise of the subject enterprise;
    - (ii) business activities are carried on at another place (place B) in Hong Kong by the subject enterprise or its closely related enterprise;
- (b) the  business  activities  carried  on  at  place  A  by  the  subject enterprise and those referred to in subparagraph (a) constitute complementary functions that are part of a cohesive business operation; and
- (c) any one or more of the following apply-
    - (i) place A would have constituted a permanent establishment for the subject enterprise but for the exceptions applicable to preparatory or auxiliary activities;
    - (ii) place  A  constitutes  a  permanent  establishment  for  the closely related enterprise;
    - (iii) place  B  constitutes  a  permanent  establishment  for  the subject enterprise or the closely related enterprise;
    - (iv) the overall activity resulting from the combination of the following is not of a preparatory or auxiliary character-
        - (A) the business activities carried on at place A by the subject enterprise;
        - (B) business activities referred to in subparagraph (a).

### Commissionnaire arrangement and similar strategies

#### Agent as permanent establishment

51. Agents  can  be  a  permanent  establishment  of  an  enterprise  if  they have, and habitually exercise, authority to conclude contracts on behalf of an enterprise.    However,  independent  agents  who  act  for  an  enterprise  in  the ordinary course of their business do not constitute a permanent establishment of that enterprise.

#### Commissionnaire arrangement

52. A  commissionnaire  arrangement  may  be  loosely  defined  as  an arrangement through which a person sells products in Hong Kong in its own name  but  on  behalf  of  an  enterprise  resident  outside  Hong  Kong  that  is  the owner of these products.    Through such an arrangement, the foreign enterprise is  able  to  sell  its  products  in  Hong  Kong  without  technically  having  a permanent establishment to which such sales may be attributed for tax purposes and without, therefore, being taxable in Hong Kong on the profits derived from such  sales.    Since  the  person  that  concludes  the  sales  does  not  own  the products that it sells, that person cannot be taxed on the profits derived from such sales and may only be taxed on the remuneration that it receives for its services (e.g. a commission).

#### Similar strategies

53. Similar strategies that seek to avoid having a permanent establishment  in  Hong  Kong  involve  situations  where  contracts  which  are substantially  negotiated  in  Hong  Kong  are  not  formally  concluded  in  Hong Kong because they are finalized or authorized abroad, or where the person that habitually exercises an authority to conclude contracts constitutes an 'independent agent' even though it is closely related to the foreign enterprise on behalf of which it is acting.

#### Sufficient taxable nexus

54. Section  7  of  Part  3  of  Schedule  17G  provides  that  despite  the absence  of  a  fixed  place  of  business,  an  enterprise  (the  enterprise)  that  is  a non-DTA territory resident person is taken to have a permanent establishment in  Hong  Kong  in  respect  of  any  activities  (the  activities)  that  a  person  (the person) undertakes for the enterprise if:
- (a) the person is acting in Hong Kong on behalf of the enterprise and in doing so-
    - (i) habitually concludes contracts; or
    - (ii) habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion  of  contracts  that  are  routinely  concluded without material modification by the enterprise; and
- (b) the contracts are-
    - (i) in the name of the enterprise;
    - (ii) for the transfer of the ownership of, or for the granting of the right to use, property owned by the enterprise or that the enterprise has the right to use; or
    - (iii) for the provision of services by the enterprise.
55. The rule for counteracting commissionnaire arrangement and similar strategies does  not apply  if the activities of the person  are  limited to preparatory  or  auxiliary  activities  that,  if  exercised  through  a  fixed  place  of business, would not make the fixed place of business a permanent establishment.

#### Independent agent

56. Section 7 of Part 3 of Schedule 17G does not apply if the person:
- (a) carries on business in Hong Kong as an independent agent; and

- (b) acts for the enterprise in the ordinary course of that business.

However, a person is not an independent agent if the person acts exclusively, or almost exclusively, on behalf of one or more enterprises that are closely related to the person.

### Subsidiary company

57. If  a  foreign  company  controls  a  Hong  Kong  resident  subsidiary company,  that  subsidiary  will  not  for  that  reason  alone  be  regarded  as  a permanent  establishment  of  the  foreign  company.    However,  the  subsidiary may be a permanent establishment of its foreign parent company if on the facts it  carries  on  the  business  of  the  parent  company  as  a  dependent  agent  in addition to its own business.    Thus, in the absence of such facts, even if:
- (a) a  company (company A) controls or is controlled by another company (company B);
- (b) company A is resident for tax purposes in a non-DTA territory;
- (c) company B-
    - (i) is resident for tax purposes in Hong Kong; or
    - (ii) carries  on  business  in  Hong  Kong  (whether  through  a permanent establishment or otherwise),

these  matters  do  not  of  themselves  constitute  either  company  a  permanent establishment of the other.

## ATTRIBUTION OF PROFITS

### Activities of non-Hong Kong resident person

58. Before quantifying the profits that arise through the activities carried out in Hong Kong, a detailed understanding is required of what the non-Hong Kong resident person's activities in Hong Kong comprise.    Information about

how  the  Hong  Kong  activities  fit  in  with  any  other  activities  outside  Hong Kong  could  be  highly  relevant.    If  details  have  not  been  provided,  the Assessor would have to obtain or investigate the facts.

59. Section 50AAK applies in relation to a year of assessment beginning on or after 1 April 2019.    In the tax return for the year of assessment 2019/20 and onwards, information relevant for the purposes of ascertaining the profits attributable to the permanent establishment in Hong Kong should be provided, including the financial statements of the non-Hong Kong resident person as a whole.    The  financial  statements  would  enable  a  better  and  comprehensive analysis  of  the  global  value  chain  and  a  proper  attribution  of  profits  to  the non-Hong Kong resident person's permanent establishment in Hong Kong.

### Financial statements or accounts

60. The  starting point in any attribution exercise is the financial statements or accounts of the permanent establishment in  Hong  Kong determined  in  accordance  with  generally  acceptable  accounting  principles. They should be a fair reflection of the real economic functions performed, the assets used and risks undertaken by the permanent establishment. A cross-check should be carried out by examining any transfer pricing documentation  (e.g.  master  file  and  local  file)  relating  to  the  functional operation of the permanent  establishment. Such  documentation  should describe  the  key  functions  performed  and  assets  used  in  the  permanent establishment's business operations.

### Attribution of profits and expenses

61. The rule for attribution of profits is the separate enterprises principle. Profits  are  attributed  to  the  permanent  establishment  in  the  amount  that  it would have made if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same of similar activities under the same or similar conditions dealing wholly independently  with  the  non-Hong  Kong  resident  person.    This  includes  the assumption that the permanent establishment would have such equity and loan capital attributed to it as it would reasonably be expected to have if it were a separate entity.

62. Expenses  are  only  attributable  to  the  permanent  establishment  in Hong Kong where they are incurred for the purposes of producing chargeable profits  of  the  permanent  establishment  regardless  of  whether  the  permanent establishment reimburses sums initially paid away by another part of the entity. That is, a real cost had been incurred and it was attributable to the permanent establishment.
63. Where expenses are incurred for other purposes apart from those of the permanent establishment in Hong Kong alone, then a reasonable apportionment  should  be  made  to  calculate  the  amount  attributable  to  the permanent establishment of the non-Hong Kong resident person.    Similarly, it may be appropriate for the expenses attributable to the Hong Kong operations to include a proportionate part of general administrative costs of the entity as a whole.    Any  reasonable  method  of  apportionment  can  be  adopted  and  it should  be  applied  consistently  from  year  to  year.    Expenses  that  are  not allowable  under  the  provisions  in  the  Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  (Cap.  112) (e.g. capital expenditure) should be excluded.

### Cost allocated with profit element

64. The  cost  of  goods  or  services  procured  from  another  part  of  the enterprise is to be recognized at full market price if the goods or services are of the same kind as those which the enterprise would normally sell or provide to third  parties  in  the  ordinary  course  of  its  trade  or  business.    An  appropriate profit  element  could  be  included,  measured  by  reference  to  the  arm's  length standard.
65. Since  a  permanent  establishment  is  a  hypothesized  separate  entity, methods including comparable uncontrolled price method, resale price method, cost plus method, transactional net margin method and profit split method, if appropriate, should be equally applicable.

### Cost allocated without profit element

66. For other expenditure not incurred in the ordinary course of trade or business, the amount to be taken into account as incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment's profits tax position is limited to the actual costs with  no  profit  element  added  (i.e.  notional  sums  are  not  deductible).    The

following issues commonly arise:

- (a) general management,  administration and support services should  be  allocated  on  an  actual  cost  basis  only  (i.e.  no mark-ups);
- (b) guarantee  fees  charged  by  head  office  or  other  parts  of  the non-Hong Kong resident person are not deductible as no credit risk happens within a single enterprise;
- (c) research  and  development  on  an  actual  cost  basis  may  be appropriate where the permanent establishment receives direct  benefits  arising  from  such  research  and  development (subject  to  conditions  required  for  deduction)  and  makes  use of the intangible created;
- (d) royalties charged by head office or other parts of the non-Hong Kong resident person  are  not  deductible  as  there  is  only  one legal entity and it is not possible to allocate legal ownership of intangible rights to any particular part of the single enterprise. However, if an unrelated third party charges a royalty for the specific use of intellectual property by the permanent establishment, then this cost may be allocated accordingly.

### Transfer of capital

67. The  transfer  of  capital  against  the  payment  of  interest  and  an undertaking  to  repay  in  full  at  a  future  date  does  not  fit  with  the  true  legal nature  of  a  permanent  establishment.    Where  no  business  of  banking  is involved, internally charged interest is non-deductible to a permanent establishment apart from the cost of funds incurred when borrowed from third parties and used in the permanent establishment's business.
68. Special considerations apply to payments  of  interest  made  by different  parts  of  a  financial  institution  to  each  other  on  advances.    Making and  receiving  advances  are  closely  related  to  the  ordinary  business  of  such enterprises so market interest rates may be acceptable.

### Reasonableness check

69. Finally,  a  reasonableness  check  is  required  to  ensure  the  profit calculated as being attributed to the permanent establishment is in line with that which  would  be  expected  from  a  comparable  business  operating  entirely  at arm's  length. This  is subject to the particular deductibility restrictions outlined  above.    The  TPG,  while  not  directly  applicable,  are  of  general assistance in this regard.

## ATTRIBUTION OF CAPITAL

### Pure computational adjustment

70. The attribution of 'free capital' (i.e. funding that does not give rise to a tax deductible interest expense) should be carried out in accordance with the arm's length principle to ensure that a fair and appropriate amount of profits is  allocated  to  the  permanent  establishment.    The  2010  Report  describes  a number of different possible approaches for applying the principle in practice, recognizing that any particular facts and circumstances are likely to give rise to a  range  of  arm's  length  results  for  the  capital  attributable  to  a  permanent establishment.
71. The  adjustment  required  is  purely  a  computational  one  for  tax purposes and has no effect on the way in which the permanent establishment conducts  or  funds  its  actual  business.    It  is  only  necessary  to  consider  the attribution  of  capital  to  a  permanent  establishment  if  interest  is  claimed  as deduction in the computation of the permanent establishment's profits. Deduction of allocated interest will remain subject to the provisions in sections

16 and 17. It may be helpful to consider the approach in terms of four steps:

#### Step 1: Attributing the assets

72. The  amount  of  capital  required  by  a  permanent  establishment  will depend on the size and nature of its activities.    The assets attributable to the permanent establishment are those from which it derives profits including both tangible and intangible assets.    These may not correspond to the assets shown on  any  existing  balance  sheet  that  the  permanent  establishment  has.    For

example, where the permanent establishment is responsible for business where assets  are  held  off  balance  sheet,  those  assets  must  be  attributed  to  the permanent  establishment.    Conversely,  some  assets  that  are  on  the  balance sheet at market value may not have required an equivalent amount of funding because their actual cost, either through in-house creation or by purchase which was  lower  than  current  value.    Revaluations  above  or  below  cost  should  be disregarded.

#### Step 2: The capital requirement calculation

73. The  capital  requirement  calculation  is  essentially  a  hypothesized balance sheet for the permanent establishment prepared purely for the purposes of the attribution of capital exercise.    Assets would be the amount determined under  step  1.    Liabilities  would  consist  of  a  balancing  figure  representing  a mixture of equity and loan capital.    This part of the exercise is concerned with determining how much of that capital would be made up of interest-free equity capital  and  how  much  by  interest-bearing  loan  capital  if  the  permanent establishment operations were carried out by a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions.
74. Generally,  the  Commissioner  does  not  accept  that  a  permanent establishment would necessarily have the most tax efficient mix of capital that is theoretically possible (i.e. comprising the minimum amount of equity capital and the maximum amount of loan capital) if such capital structures are not in fact seen at arm's length. So for capital attribution to permanent establishments,  in  addition  to  considering  how  much  an  independent  banker might have loaned to a similar business operation with similar assets, there are a number of factors that may have a bearing on how much interest-bearing debt would have been carried by the permanent establishment operations if they had been carried out by a separate entity.    Those factors could include:
- (a) the capital structure of the non-resident person as a whole;
- (b) the  capital  structure  of  other  companies  of  the  same  size, trading in Hong Kong;
- (c) the capital structure of other companies undertaking the same type of activities in Hong Kong;
- (d) the capital structure of other companies, trading in Hong Kong, that are comparable, in both size and in terms of its activities, to the permanent establishment operations; and
- (e) interest-free  facilities ─ where any part of the existing debt capital  is  on  interest-free  terms,  it  can  be  treated  as  meeting part, or all, of the equity capital requirement.
75. It is accepted that post tax profits can be counted as equity capital to the extent that these funds have been kept in Hong Kong and not remitted to head office.    To the extent that profits have not been remitted to head office, they  can  be  taken  into  account  as  they  accrue.    Financial  statements  would need to be provided to demonstrate the measure of retained profits where these had not been provided in detail before.    The same principle applies to losses. Where a non-Hong Kong resident person has losses, these should also be taken into account and they will effectively increase the amount of capital that needs to  be  attributed  to  the  permanent  establishment.    There  should  be  consistent treatment for both profits and losses with the same basis being applied to both.

#### Step  3:  Determine  the  notional  costs  of  the  permanent  establishment  capital requirement

76. Step 3 is a calculation of the notional funding costs on the combined amount representing the equity and loan capital determined under step 2.    So far as the equity capital is concerned, this will be nil.
77. The  notional  interest  and  other  borrowing  costs  applicable  to  the permanent  establishment  loan  capital  requirement  should  be  derived  mainly from the actual terms, including interest rates and other charges, of actual loans borrowed by the non-Hong Kong resident person and permanent establishment. Other  factors  may  then  require  adjustment  such  as  where  the  actual  loan currency differs from the functional currency of the permanent establishment.
78. Where the non-Hong Kong resident person and permanent establishment  have  various  loan  facilities  with  different  rates  of  interest  and charges,  an  appropriate  mix  of  interest  bearing  funds  held  by  the  permanent establishment will then have to be determined and the actual interest and other costs of those borrowed funds identified.

79. There is an inevitable tension between the hypothesis of a permanent establishment being a distinct and separate enterprise and the fact that it is in practice part of a larger entity.    The legislative requirement that the attribution should be based on the hypothesis that the permanent establishment is a distinct and  separate  enterprise,  engaged  in  the  same  or  similar  activities  under  the same  or  similar  conditions  goes  some  way  to  resolving  this  tension.    It recognizes the need  to look at the economic  reality of  the  permanent establishment's  activities.    In  line  with  this,  and  making  it  clear  that  the legislation  is  not  simply  seeking  to  treat  the  permanent  establishment  for  tax purposes  as  if  it  were  a  free  standing  subsidiary  of  similar  size,  section 50AAK(4) states for  the  avoidance  of  doubt  that  among  the  same  or  similar conditions are included the fact that the permanent establishment has the same credit rating as the non-Hong Kong resident person of which it is a part.    That reflects the economic and legal reality that the permanent establishment is able to obtain funds at a cost below that of an independent entity of the same size. Consequently there should be no hypothesized additional borrowing cost paid from the permanent establishment to the rest of the entity on the assumption that  the  rest  of  the  entity  guaranteed  the  permanent  establishment's  assumed borrowings.
80. Incidental  costs  of  borrowing  could  also  be  restricted.    Section 50AAK(6) specifies that no deduction may be made for any costs in excess of those  that  would  have  been  incurred  if  the  permanent  establishment  had  the equity  and  loan  capital  assumed  by  section  50AAK(4).    The  term  'cost'  is intentionally  not  limited  in  the  legislation,  except  by  its  context,  to  give  it  a broader  meaning than  simply  interest.    Its  context  will  restrict  it  to  funding, funding related costs and costs incidental to funding.    It will certainly include fees  and  incidental  costs  associated  with  loans.    It  is  also  broad  enough  and intended to catch non-interest funding and funding related costs such as swap payments  and  premiums,  whether  related  to  hedging  or  used  as  the  primary method of funding (e.g. embedded loans in  swap arrangements), and foreign exchange losses.    These costs are limited to that part of the costs relating to that  part  of  the  funding  displaced  from  the  permanent  establishment  by  the assumptions on equity and loan capital.

#### Step 4: Determine the capital attribution tax adjustment to be made

81. This is the simple calculation of the difference between the permanent establishment's claimed funding costs and the notional costs of the permanent establishment capital requirement calculated in step 3.    The capital attribution  tax  adjustment  should  be  carried  to  the  permanent  establishment's tax computation.

### Use of comparables

82. Section  50AAK(2)  requires  the  permanent  establishment  to  be regarded as a distinct and separate enterprise carrying on the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions.    There are a number of reasons why  the  activities  of  the  permanent  establishment  might  differ  from  those generally  carried  on  by  a  separate  entity  of  the  same  size  as  the  permanent establishment,  trading  in  Hong  Kong.    It  may  therefore  be  difficult  to  find Hong Kong entities that are true comparables to the permanent establishment in terms of both size and level or type of activities.    If appropriate comparables can be found, then these can be used as an indicator of the amount of equity and loan capital that the permanent establishment would have had at arm's length.

### Use of calculations based on funding of the non-Hong Kong resident person

83. In most cases, the way the non-Hong Kong resident person, of which the  permanent  establishment  is  a  part,  funds  itself  in  the  market  will  be  the most  obvious  measure  of  an  arm's  length  mix  of  funding  for  that  person. Where this is so, there is clearly scope for considering the extent to which the funding  of  the  permanent  establishment  would  replicate  the  funding  of  the whole  non-Hong  Kong  resident  person.    Generally,  unless  the  activities carried  on  by  the  permanent  establishment  are  sufficiently  similar  to  those carried  on  by  the  non-Hong  Kong  resident  person  as  a  whole,  it  may  not  be possible to apply the capital ratios of the non-Hong Kong resident person to the permanent establishment in Hong  Kong. Where  the activities of the permanent establishment are sufficiently different from those of the rest of the non-Hong Kong resident person  to  warrant  that  the  permanent  establishment would have a somewhat different capital structure, the capital structure of the whole non-Hong Kong resident person could still be used as a starting point with appropriate adjustments being made.

84. The  use  of  more  than  one  method  as  a  back-up  check  might  be considered  if  a  particular  case  warrants  the  resources  necessary  to  undertake the exercise (e.g. comparables might prove to be a good check where capital has been attributed to the permanent establishment based on the capital mix of the non-Hong Kong resident person as a whole).

**Example**

Corporation-F manufactured its products in a permanent establishment  factory  in  Hong  Kong.    The  products  were  sold  by Corporation-F  to  a  third  party  distributor.    Corporation-F  had other manufacturing operations carried out through subsidiaries in various  jurisdictions.    In  the  year  of  enquiry,  Corporation-F  paid interest of $5 million to a bank on a new loan of $100 million that was obtained to purchase a factory in Hong Kong at $90 million and plant  and  machinery  at  $10  million.      In  addition,  an  initial  1% arrangement fee of $1 million was paid.    The loan was secured in part  by  the  factory  premises  in  Hong  Kong  and  in  part  by  a guarantee from Corporation-F relating to its other world-wide assets. The interest cost of $5 million and the arrangement fee of $1 million were claimed as deduction in the tax computation of the permanent establishment in Hong Kong.

The permanent establishment in Hong Kong had no assets other than the  factory  and  plant  and  machinery.    These  had  been  purchased recently at arm's length price, so there was no suggestion that their value was significantly more or less than $100 million.    Clearly, a borrower would not be able to obtain a loan from an independent party  if  the  balance  sheet  was  thinly  capitalized.    A  lender  would seek  to  minimize  its  own  risk  by  insisting  on  equity  shareholders putting up equity to absorb some of the risks themselves should the business plan fail to repay the loan and interest throughout the term of the loan.

Step 1: Determine the assets attributable to the permanent establishment

The permanent establishment assets were clearly $100 million.

Step 2: Make the capital requirement calculation

The security that a lender would take from taking a charge over the factory could be quite a high percentage of its value, probably ranged from  60%  to  80%  of  the  recent  purchase  price  (i.e.  between  $54 million and $72 million less anticipated costs of potential foreclosure).    In  this  example,  if  the  permanent  establishment's income  was  high  compared  to  the  costs  of  servicing  the  debt,  the banker might agree to offer the higher amount.

There  were  no  factors  to  be  taken  into  account  in  respect  of  the non-Hong Kong resident person's capital structure and the banker's approach  was  not  out  of  step  with  that  would  be  taken  towards similar operations in Hong Kong carried out by separate entities.

So, the capital requirement of $100 million would be comprised of equity of $28 million and debt of $72 million.

Step 3: Determine the notional costs of the permanent establishment capital requirement

The notional cost of the $28 million equity would be nil as equity is interest-free  capital.    The  costs  of  $72  million  of  the  debt  are calculated as follows:

Step 4: Determine the capital attribution tax adjustment to be made

| Interest cost: $5 million × 72% =   | $3.60 million   |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Arrangement fee: $1 million × 72% = | $0.72 million   |
|                                     | $4.32 million   |

The borrowing costs claimed in the tax computation for the accounting  period  were  $6  million.    Hence,  an  amount  of  $1.68 million should be disallowed.

### OECD additional guidance

85. Additional  Guidance  on  the  Attribution  of  Profits  to  Permanent Establishments, BEPS Action 7 , which was issued by the OECD in March 2018 (the  Additional  Guidance),  helps  illustrating  the  attribution  of  profits  to permanent establishments under permanent establishment article of the MTC in the following circumstances:
- (a) warehousing delivery, merchandising and information collection activities;
- (b) commissionaire structure;
- (c) sale of advertising on a website; and
- (d) procurement of goods.

86. On the whole, the Commissioner agrees with the principles contained in the Additional Guidance and will follow the high-level principles outlined therein.

### Dependent agent permanent establishment

87. The  Additional  Guidance  makes  it  clear  that  the  relevance  of attribution of profits to a dependent agent permanent establishment (DAPE) is to capture the difference between the profits commensurate with the functions carried out by the dependent agent, if any, and that received by the dependent agent.    Not each and every DAPE would automatically lead to attribution of incremental  profits.    For  example,  if  the  dependent  agent  does  not  carry  out SPF  or  KERT  functions,  then  no  incremental  profits  relating  to  any  routine functions  would  be  attributed  to  the  DAPE  over  and  above  the  arm's  length remuneration  received  by  the  DAPE,  in  most  cases  being  an  associated enterprise of the foreign principal.
88. If a DAPE has been found to exist, its profits should be determined using  the  same  principles  as  for  any  other  permanent  establishment.    To  do this, the SPF or KERT functions performed on behalf of the foreign principal by the dependent agent are used to determine the assets and risks of the DAPE.

After  the  assets  and  risks  of  the  DAPE  have  been  determined,  capital  is attributed  to  support  those  risks,  and  income  from  transactions  with  other enterprises is attributed to the DAPE, in particular from the contracts concluded on  its  behalf  by  the  dependent  agent.    The  DAPE  must  then  reward  the dependent agent for its functions.

89. If no assets and risks are attributed to the DAPE under step 1, there is  unlikely to be any profit remaining after deducting the commission or fees paid to the dependent agent.    If, however, there are assets and risks attributed to the DAPE, there may be profits remaining in the DAPE to be taxed.

## ADDITIONAL TAX

### Penalty not exceeding the amount of tax undercharged

90. To ensure compliance with the fundamental rule, an administrative penalty by way of additional tax relating to transfer pricing is provided under section 82A(1D) and (1F).    Noting that transfer pricing is not an exact science and having regard to international practices, the additional tax is set at a level lower than those for other non-compliances under section 82A(1). Specifically, a person who commits an offence is liable to an additional tax not exceeding the amount of tax undercharged (vis-à-vis an amount trebling the tax undercharged, as imposed for incorrect return and other matters under section 82A).
91. If an assessment or additional assessment is made on a person under section 50AAK(9), such person is liable to an additional tax pursuant to section 82A(1C)  and  (1D).    The  maximum  penalty  is  the  difference  between  the amount  of  tax  assessed  on  the  basis  of  the  amount  of  the  person's  incomes under section 50AAK(9) and the amount of tax that would have been assessed if  the  amount of the person's income as stated in the person's tax return had been accepted for the purpose of assessment.
92. If an assessment made on a person for a year of assessment has taken into  account  the  person's  loss  for  an  earlier  year  of  assessment  as  computed under section 50AAK(9), such person is liable to an additional tax pursuant to section 82A(1E) and (1F) for that year of assessment.    The maximum penalty

is  the  difference  between  the  amount  of  tax  assessed  taking  into  account  the amount of the person's loss computed under section 50AAK(9) and the amount of  tax  that  would  have  been  assessed  if  the  amount  of  the  person's  loss  as stated in the tax return for the earlier year had been accepted for the purpose of assessment.

### No penalty if reasonable efforts are proved

93. Section  82A(1G)  provides  that  no  additional  tax  under  section 82A(1D)  and  (1F)  should  be  imposed  on  a  person  who  proves  reasonable efforts have been made to determine the arm's length amount.
94. A reasonable effort means the degree of effort that an independent and competent person engaged in the same line of business or endeavour would exercise under similar circumstances.    What is reasonable is based on what a reasonable  business  person  in  the  permanent  establishment's  circumstances would  do,  having  regard  to  the  complexity  and  importance  of  the  transfer pricing issues that arise in that particular case.
95. Permanent  establishments  are  considered  as  not  having  exercised reasonable effort in the following examples:
- (a) there  is  no  process  in  place  or  documentation  to  check  the selection or application of transfer pricing methods;
- (b) there is some contemporaneous documentation but no analysis of functions, assets, risks, market  conditions  or business strategies;
- (c) there is evidence of limited efforts to develop and implement a transfer pricing setting process but the process is not sufficiently developed or properly implemented having regard to  the  complexity  and  importance  of  the  particular  transfer pricing issues;
- (d) non-arm's length transactions are used as comparables; or
- (e) the  documentation  is  prepared  with  the  use  of  inappropriate statistical  tools  (e.g.  inappropriate  use  of  average  results  of multiple years).

### More stringent penalty

96. The Commissioner would not rule out the possibilities of imposing more stringent penalty or initiating criminal prosecutions if there are apparent violations of the provisions in sections 80 and 82, or other relevant provisions in  section  82A.    Such  cases  may  involve  not  only  transfer  pricing  issue  but also omission or understatement of income.

### Basic Principles Used to Attribute Profits to a Bank Permanent Establishment

#### Distinct and separate enterprise

1. For banks, it is necessary to determine the profits which permanent establishment  might  be  expected  to  make  if  it  were  a  distinct  and  separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, taking into account the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the enterprise through the permanent establishment and through the other parts of the enterprise.    A permanent establishment is not the same as a subsidiary since it is not in fact legally or economically separate from the rest of  the  enterprise  of  which  it  is  a  part.    This  is  of  course  a  natural  outcome, resulting from the decision to operate through a permanent establishment rather than  a  subsidiary.    The  following  issues  are  of  particular  significance  when applying  the  Authorised  OECD  Approach  (the  AOA)  to  bank  permanent establishments.

#### Functional and factual analysis

2. In the context of the AOA, the functional and factual analysis is used to  delineate  the  permanent  establishment  as  a  hypothesized  separate  and independent enterprise.    The functional and factual analysis will also take into account  the  assets  used  and  risks  assumed  as  a  result  of  performing  those functions.    Of  particular  importance  will  be  the  determination  of  the  Key Entrepreneurial Risk-Taking (KERT) functions of the enterprise and the extent to  which  the  permanent  establishment  undertakes  those  functions.    This  is because it is the performance of those functions that leads to the assumption of the greatest risks and the AOA  attributes economic ownership of the income-generating  assets  (i.e.  the  loans  associated  with  those  functions  and risks, to the part of the enterprise which performs those functions).    In short, the functional and factual analysis determines the attribution of profits to the permanent  establishment  in  accordance  with  its  functions  performed,  assets used and risks assumed by the permanent establishment, and informs also the

attribution of free capital and interest-bearing debt to the permanent establishment.

3. The  functional  and  factual  analysis  is  of  critical  importance.  In delineating  the  permanent  establishment,  it  is  not  sufficient  to  record  loan assets in the books without consideration of where the KERT functions leading to their creation are performed.    Nor is it sufficient in attributing profits to a permanent establishment to prepare symmetrically balanced books attributing profits in the books of the permanent establishment that correspond exactly to the values used in the books of the head office.    Ideally, book entries will be consistent with, and follow from, the functional and factual analysis.    Where this is in fact the case, the books provide a starting point for determining the profits attributable to the permanent establishment.

#### Attribution of assets and risks

4. Financial assets and related risks will be attributed to the permanent establishment  in  accordance  with  a  functional  and  factual  analysis  of  the banking enterprise of which the permanent establishment is a part that seeks to identify the  KERT functions. The KERT functions associated with traditional banking business of the kind covered in this part of Part II of the 2010 Report on  the  Attribution  of  Profits  to  Permanent  Establishments (the  2010  Report) will generally relate to:
- (a) the creation of financial assets, typically loans;
- (b) the subsequent management of the risks associated with those assets.

This  determination  should  be  made  on  a  case-by-case  basis  as  the  KERT functions and especially their relative importance will depend on the particular facts  and  circumstances.    Other  assets  and  risks  will  be  attributed  to  the permanent establishment in accordance with a functional and factual analysis that  seeks  to  identify  the  Significant  People  Function  (SPF)  relevant  to  the economic ownership of assets and the SPF relevant to the assumption and/or management  (subsequent  to  the  transfer)  of  risks,  except  that  the  economic ownership  of  tangible  assets  will  be  attributed  to  their  place  of  use  in  the absence of circumstances in a particular case that warrant a different view.

#### Attribution of capital

5. The factual starting point for the attribution of capital is that a bank's capital is primarily required to support the risks assumed by the bank through its making of loans (and to support the risks associated with off-balance sheet items  such  as  undrawn  commitments  to  make  loans).    This  capital  must  be regarded as following those risks.    In other words, capital is to be attributed to a permanent establishment by reference to the risks arising from its activities, and not the other way round.
6. The attribution of free capital can have a significant impact upon the amount  of  profit  attributed  to  the  permanent  establishment.    It  is  therefore important  that  the  attribution  of  capital  should  be  carried  out  in  accordance with the arm's length principle, to ensure that an appropriate amount of profits is attributed to the permanent establishment.    Under the arm's length principle, a bank permanent establishment, just like any other permanent establishment, should have sufficient capital to support the functions it undertakes, the assets it uses  and  the  risks  it  assumes.    The  2010  Report  describes  a  number  of different possible approaches for applying that principle in practice, recognizing that the attribution of capital to a permanent establishment is not an exact science, and that any particular facts and circumstances are likely to give rise to a range of arm's length results for the capital attributable to a permanent establishment, not a single figure.
7. The  different  possible  approaches  for  attributing  capital  to  the permanent establishment of a bank all have their strengths and weaknesses in terms  of  how  closely  they  approximate  to  the  arm's  length  principle,  the relative  importance  of  which  will  depend  on  the  circumstances.    The  key  to attributing capital is to recognize:
- (a) the existence of the strengths and weaknesses in any approach, and when these are likely to be present;
- (b) that  the  key  test  of  the  suitability  of  an  approach  in  any particular  case  is  whether  it  gives  a  result  that  is  consistent with the arm's length principle. It may well be appropriate to test  this  by  applying  one  of  the  other  approaches,  to  see whether this produces an outcome within a similar range.

#### Recognition of dealings

8. There are a number of aspects to the recognition or not of dealings between a permanent establishment and the rest of the enterprise of which it is a part.    First, a permanent establishment is not the same as a subsidiary, and it is not in fact legally or economically separate from the rest of the enterprise of which it is a part.    It follows that:
- (a) save  in  exceptional  circumstances,  all  parts  of  a  banking enterprise have the same creditworthiness.    This is the reality as  seen  by  depositors  and  other  creditors  of  the  bank.    It means  that  dealings  between  a  permanent  establishment  and the rest of the banking enterprise of which it is a part should generally  be  priced  on  the  basis  that  both  share  the  same creditworthiness; and
- (b) there  is  no  scope  for  the  rest  of  the  bank  guaranteeing  the permanent establishment's creditworthiness, or for the permanent establishment to guarantee the creditworthiness of the rest of the banking enterprise of which it is a part.
9. Second, dealings between a permanent establishment and the rest of the enterprise of which it is a part normally have no legal consequences for the enterprise  as  a  whole.    This  implies  a  need  for  greater  scrutiny  of  dealings between a permanent establishment and the rest of the enterprise of which it is a  part  than  of  transactions  between  two  associated  enterprises.    This  also implies a greater scrutiny of documentation (in the inevitable absence of legally binding contracts) that might otherwise exist and considering the uniqueness of this  issue,  banks  would  be  required  to  demonstrate  clearly  that  it  would  be appropriate to recognize the dealing.
10. This greater scrutiny means a threshold needs to be passed before a dealing is accepted as equivalent to a transaction that would have taken place between  independent  enterprises  acting  at  arm's  length.    Only  once  that threshold is passed can a dealing be reflected in an attribution of profits.    A functional  and  factual  analysis  will  determine  whether  a  real  and  identifiable event has occurred and should be taken into account as a dealing of economic significance  between  the  permanent  establishment  and  another  part  of  the

enterprise. For example, an accounting record and contemporaneous documentation  showing  a  dealing  that  purports  to  transfer  economically significant  risks,  responsibilities  and  benefits  would  provide  a  useful  starting point for the purposes of attributing profits.    Banks are encouraged to prepare such documentation, as it may reduce substantially the potential for controversies  regarding  application  of  the  AOA.    Effect  would  be  given  to such documentation, notwithstanding its lack of legal effect, to the extent that:

- (a) the  documentation  is  consistent  with  the  economic  substance of the activities taking place within the enterprise as revealed by the functional and factual analysis;
- (b) the arrangements documented  in  relation to the dealing, viewed in their entirety, do not differ from those which would have  been  adopted  by  comparable  independent  enterprises behaving in a commercially rational manner or, if they do so differ, the structure as presented in the documentation does not practically impede the tax administration from determining an appropriate transfer price; and
- (c) the dealing presented in the documentation does not violate the principles of the AOA by purporting to transfer risks in a way that segregates them from functions.
11. It  is  important  to  note,  however,  that  the  AOA  is  generally  not intended to impose more burdensome documentation requirements in connection  with  intra-enterprise  dealings  than  apply  to  transactions  between associated enterprises. Moreover, as in the case of transfer pricing documentation,  the  requirements  should  not  be  applied  in  such  a  way  as  to impose on banks costs and burdens disproportionate to the circumstances.
12. Third,  where  dealings  are  capable  of  being  recognized,  they  may reflect  a  transfer  of  assets  and/or  risks  between  the  permanent  establishment and other parts of the enterprise to which it belongs.    As a consequence the characterization and recognition of dealings will affect the attribution of risks, assets  and  therefore  capital  to  the  permanent  establishment.    Moreover,  the dealings  should  be  priced  on  an  arm's  length  basis,  assuming  the  permanent establishment  and  the  rest  of  the  enterprise  of  which  it  is  a  part  to  be

independent  of  one  another.    This  should  be  done  by  analogy,  following  a functional and factual analysis.

13. Traditional  banking  involves  borrowing  money  from  depositors  for on-lending to third parties.    Interest costs are consequently an intrinsic part of a  bank's business, and its trading profits can only properly be determined by deducting such costs.    It follows that lending and borrowing by a permanent establishment to and from the rest of the enterprise of which it is a part should generally be recognized where it  meets the requirements for recognition as a dealing.    Such  borrowing  may,  however,  be  displaced  by  the  attribution  of capital to the permanent establishment's assets and risks, as indeed may third party borrowing.

#### Attribution of profits

14. The attribution of profits to a permanent establishment of a bank on an arm's length basis will follow from the calculation of the profits (or losses) from all  its  activities,  including  transactions  with  other  unrelated  enterprises, transactions with related enterprises (with direct application of the guidance of the OECD Transfer  Pricing  Guidelines  for  Multilateral  Enterprises  and  Tax Administrations (the  TPG)),  and  dealings  with  other  parts  of  the  enterprise (under step 2 of the AOA).    This analysis involves the following two steps:

Step 1: A functional and factual analysis, leading to -

- (a) The attribution to the permanent establishment as appropriate of the rights and obligations arising out of transactions between the enterprise of which the permanent establishment is a part and separate enterprises;
- (b) The  identification  of  the  KERT  functions  relevant  to  the economic  ownership  of  financial  assets  and  the  assumption and/or management (subsequent to the transfer) of related risks, and the attribution of those assets and risks to the permanent establishment;
- (c) The  identification of SPFs  relevant to the attribution of economic  ownership  of  other  assets,  and  the  attribution  of

economic ownership of those assets to the permanent establishment;

- (d) The identification of SPFs relevant to the assumption of other risks,  and  the  attribution  of  those  risks  to  the  permanent establishment;
- (e) The identification of other functions of the permanent establishment;
- (f) The  recognition  and  determination  of  the  nature  of  those dealings between the permanent establishment and other parts of  the  same  enterprise  that  can  appropriately  be  recognized, having passed the threshold test; and
- (g) The  attribution of capital based  on  the assets and  risks attributed to the permanent establishment.

Step 2: The pricing on an arm's length basis of recognized dealings through -
- (a) The determination of comparability between the dealings and uncontrolled  transactions,  established  by  applying  the  TPG's comparability  factors  directly  (characteristics  of  property  or services,  economic  circumstances  and  business  strategies)  or by analogy (functional analysis, contractual terms) in light of the particular factual circumstances of the permanent establishment; and
- (b) Selecting and applying by analogy to the guidance in the TPG the most appropriate method to the circumstances of the case to  arrive  at  an  arm's  length  compensation  for  the  dealings between  the  permanent  establishment  and  the  rest  of  the enterprise, taking into account the functions performed by and the assets and risks attributed to the permanent establishment.
15. The  pricing  on  an  arm's  length  basis  of  any  transactions  with associated enterprises attributed to the permanent establishment should follow the guidance in the TPG.    The order of the listing of items within each of the

steps  above  is  not  meant  to  be  prescriptive,  as  the  various  items  may  be interrelated  (e.g.  risk  is  initially  attributed  to  a  permanent  establishment  as  it performs the SPF relevant to the assumption of that risk but the recognition and characterization of a subsequent dealing between the permanent establishment and another part of the enterprise that manages the risk may lead to a transfer of the  risk  and  supporting  capital  to  the  other  part  of  the  enterprise).    The resulting determination of the profits attributable to the permanent establishment reflects both its income and expense from recognized dealings in amounts  equal  to  an  arm's  length  compensation  for  the  functions  that  the permanent  establishment  and  the  rest  of  the  enterprise  of  which  it  is  a  part respectively perform, taking into account the assets and risks attributed to the permanent establishment and the other parts of the enterprise.

#### Five Steps in determining an adjustment to funding costs

16. It  should  be  noted  that  a  required  adjustment  to  funding  costs  is purely a computational one for tax purposes and has no effect on the way in which  a  permanent  establishment  conducts  or  funds  its  actual  business.    It may be helpful to consider the approach in terms of five distinct steps.

##### Step 1: Determine the assets attributable to the permanent establishment

17. The  amount  of  capital  required  by  a  permanent  establishment  will depend on the size and nature of its activities.    Those activities are evidenced by the assets attributable to the permanent establishment from which it derives profits.    Where the permanent establishment is responsible for the creation of a financial asset then both the asset and the related income should be attributed to  that  permanent  establishment.    The  assets  attributable  to  the  permanent establishment may not correspond to the assets shown on its balance sheet if such exists.
18. Regarding the frequency of calculating risk  weighted  assets,  in  the absence  of  significant  changes  over  the  basis  period,  the  drawing  up  a  tax balance sheet on an annual basis should be sufficient though bank permanent establishments are not prohibited from doing so more frequently.

##### Step 2: Risk weight those assets

19. Banks  are  regulated  entities.    As  such  they  are  required  by  their regulator to maintain a certain level of capital to support their financial assets. From a supervisory perspective capital provides a buffer that enables a bank to absorb losses without the interests of the depositors being adversely affected. In general terms, the more risky the asset, the more is the capital required to support it.    Thus, capital follows risk and regulatory capital is determined in a banking context by attributing a risk weighting to the financial assets.
20. Because there is  a  regulatory  framework  that  banks  adhere  to,  this framework  can  be  used  to  help  calculate the capital that  a  permanent establishment would have if it were a separate enterprise.    Once assets have been  correctly  attributed  to  the  permanent  establishment  they  can  be  risk weighted to establish the amount of capital that is required to support them.
21. Where  the  regulatory  regime  of  the  home  state  is  not  materially different to that operated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the permanent  establishment's  assets  may  initially  be  risk  weighted  according  to the  home  state's  rules.    However,  any  major  differences  between  the  home state's  rules  and  those  operated  by  Hong  Kong  will  need  to  be  adjusted  for. For example, some regulators allow transactions between separate legal entities in  their  jurisdictions  to  be  risk  weighted  at  0%  while  this  would  not  be permitted.    If assets of the permanent establishment are initially risk weighted on the basis of the home state's rule, an adjustment would need to be made to reflect  the  fact  that  those  assets  would  require  a  higher  risk  weighting  as required.

##### Step 3: Determine the equity capital

22. Section  50AAK(2) requires that the  attribution  should  be  based  on the  hypothesis  that  the  permanent  establishment  is  a  distinct  and  separate enterprise, engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions goes some way to resolving this tension.    It recognizes the need to look at the economic reality of the permanent establishment's activities, which may  in  practice  go  beyond  those  which  would  be  possible  for  a  small independent bank.    In line with this, and making it clear that the legislation is not simply seeking to treat the permanent establishment for tax purposes as if it

were a free standing subsidiary of similar size, section 50AAK(4)(a) states, for the avoidance of doubt, that among the same or similar conditions are included the  fact  that  the  permanent  establishment  has  the  same  credit  rating  as  the non-resident  bank  of  which  it  is  part.    This  reflects  the  economic  and  legal reality  that  it  is  able  to  obtain  funds  at  a  cost  below  that  of  an  independent entity of the same size.

23. The  amount  of  equity  capital  to  be  attributed  to  the  permanent establishment will therefore be that appropriate to the level of the permanent establishment's  risk-weighted  assets,  any  exceptional  factors,  and  the  likely capital  adequacy  requirements  for  a  Hong  Kong  banking  business  of  similar size and business activities.
24. If the permanent establishment were a separate enterprise trading in Hong Kong then it would be set a  minimum level  of  regulatory  capital.    In addition,  most  banks  actually  operate  with  levels  of  capital  in  excess  of  the level set by the HKMA and the amount of this excess varies depending on the needs,  activities  and  the  attitude  of  that  particular  bank.    Thus,  as  a  starting point,  the  amount  of  capital  that  the  permanent  establishment  would  have  at arm's  length  would  be  over  and  above  the  regulatory  minimum,  but  the questions  still  arise  as  to  what  that  regulatory  minimum  would  be  and  how much  more  capital  the  permanent  establishment  would  actually  have.    In forming a view on this there are a number of factors that could be taken into account:
- (a) the level of capital that the bank has as a whole;
- (b) the  level  of  capital  held  by  other  banks  of  the  same  size, trading in Hong Kong;
- (c) the level of capital held by banks undertaking the same type of activities in Hong Kong;
- (d) the level of capital held by a bank, trading in Hong Kong that is comparable, in both size and in terms of its activities, to the permanent establishment.

25. The 2010 Report provides for several approaches to be used when determining the equity capital needed to fund the assets and support the risks attributed  to  a  bank  permanent  establishment.    If  an  approach  is  appropriate for determining the equity capital attributable to the bank permanent establishment  in  a  particular  case,  it  may  be  adopted  for  the  purposes  of complying with the provisions in section 50AAK(4)(b).
26. In practice it may be difficult to find banks that are true comparables in  both  terms  of  size  and  level  or  type  of  activities,  so  as  a  practical  starting point consideration may be given to the capital levels of the bank of which the permanent establishment is a part.    Thus, if the bank as a whole has a capital ratio  of  say  11%,  then  as  a  starting  point  it  might  be  assumed  that  the permanent establishment would have a similar capital ratio.
27. There may be instances where such an approach would not produce a level of capital that would be in an arm's length range, for instance where the bank  itself  is  based  in  a  country  where  banks'  capital  falls  very  close  to  the regulatory  minimum  (where  the  figure  might  be  too  low  for  a  permanent establishment in a country where banks were generally much more generously capitalized).    In  such  a  case,  using  the  capital  ratio  figure  of  the  bank  as  a whole might produce a figure that  would be less than the  minimum level of capital that would be required.    More critically, it might give a figure which is significantly out of line with the known level of capital for banks carrying out a banking business in Hong Kong.
28. It may  also be the case that the activities of  the  permanent establishment are not a microcosm of the activities of the bank as a whole, with the  permanent  establishment  undertaking  activities  which  are  either  more,  or less, risky than those undertaken by other parts of the same bank.    However, in this situation it is envisaged that, if necessary, adjustments could be made, so if  permanent  establishment  carries  on  a  relatively  greater  proportion  of  more risky activities than the bank as a whole, it might be reasonable to assume that as a stand alone it would have a slightly higher capital ratio, and vice versa.

##### Step 4: Determine the loan capital

29. Section 50AAK(4)(b) in effect requires that a permanent establishment of a foreign bank to have such equity and loan capital as it could reasonably be expected to have as if it were a distinct and separate enterprise, engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions. This means looking not just at the amount of equity capital that the permanent establishment would have at arm's length, but also looking at the mix of equity and loan capital that it  would  have  if  it  were  a  separate  enterprise  trading  in Hong Kong in the same or similar conditions.
30. When  considering  the  mix  of  equity  and  loan  capital  that  the permanent  establishment  would  have  at  arm's  length,  it  is  possible  that  in certain circumstances this mix could include interest-bearing regulatory capital securities  (e.g.  Additional  Tier  1  and  Tier  2,  and  banking  loss  absorbing capacity instruments).
31. The Commissioner does not accept that a permanent establishment would have the most tax efficient mix of capital that is theoretically possible (i.e.  comprising  the  minimum  amount  of  equity  capital  and  the  maximum amount of loan capital) because such capital structures are not in fact seen at arm's length.

##### Step 5: Determine the capital attribution tax adjustment

32. Having established the  equity  and  loan  capital,  which  a  permanent establishment would require, it is necessary to arrive at the hypothetical cost of such capital for the purposes of the capital attribution tax adjustment.
33. As  far  as  the  equity  capital  is  concerned  this  will  be  nil.    To  the extent that there is deductible regulatory capital to be taken into consideration this will form part of the loan capital.    The rate of interest to be applied to the total amount of loan capital will depend on a number of factors including the functional currency of the permanent establishment, the likely hypothetical mix of loan capital and to some extent the actual nature of, and rate of interest on, loan capital  held by  the permanent establishment and the bank of which it is part.

**Example 1**

The  Hong  Kong  branch  of  Bank-F,  which  was  incorporated  in  a Jurisdiction-F, was funded by its head office with short term loans of $8,000  million  at  an  interest  cost  of  5%,  a  10-year  loan  of  $250 million  at  an  interest  cost  of  7%;  and  an  interest-free  allotment  of capital of $750 million.

Under a functional and factual analysis and in accordance with the provisions in section 50AAK, the Hong Kong branch was required to have  equity  capital  of  $1,500  million  and  loan  capital  of  $500 million, the appropriate interest rate for attributed loan capital was agreed  at  6%  and,  that  the  funding  that  was  displaced  by  the attributed  equity  and  loan  capital  was  agreed  as  the  $750  million allotted  equity,  $250  million  10-year  loan  and  $1,000  million  of short-term loans.

The attributed capital and its cost would be:

| Type of capital   | Amount of capital $ million   | Interest rate   | Cost $ million   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Equity capital    | 1,500                         | 0%              | Nil              |
| Loan capital      | 500                           | 6%              | 30               |
| Total             | 2,000                         |                 | 30               |

The funding and its cost would be:

| Type of funding   | Amount of funding $ million   | Interest rate   | Cost $ million   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Allotted capital  | 750                           | 0%              | Nil              |
| 10-year loan      | 250                           | 7%              | 17.5             |
| Short-term loan   | 1,000                         | 5%              | 50.0             |
| Total             | 2,000                         |                 | 67.5             |

The disallowed funding cost would be:

The disallowed interest under section 50AAK as the capital attribution tax adjustment should be $37.5 million ($67.5 million -$30 million).

34. It  is  important to be clear that the mix of, and cost of, loan capital actually held by the permanent establishment will not necessarily determine the hypothetical cost of loan capital.    Neither will that cost be based on the most tax effective capital cost (i.e. the maximum possible amount of tax deductible Additional  Tier  1  and  Tier  2  subordinated  debt).    The  aim  is  to  arrive  at  an amount, which reflects the requirements of the legislation.
35. The hypothetical funding cost reached as described above must then be compared with the actual funding costs of an equivalent amount of funding in the permanent establishment.    Clearly, any interest-free funds provided by the bank will be deducted from this total figure first.    An appropriate mix of interest-bearing funds held by the permanent establishment will then have to be determined and the actual interest costs of those funds identified.
36. The  difference  between  the  hypothetical  funding  costs  for  the appropriate mix of equity and loan capital and the actual funding costs of an equivalent amount of funding is the capital attribution tax adjustment required.
37. If regulatory capital securities have been issued through and used to fund  the  permanent  establishment,  then  the  interest  rate  on  the  loan  capital should  be  used  to  calculate  the  costs  of  the  loan  capital  of  the  permanent establishment.    However,  to  the  extent  that  the  amount  of  such  loan  capital issued exceeds the amount assumed by section 50AAK(4)(b), then a disallowance  will  arise.    The  disallowance  to  be  taken  into  account  in  the capital attribution tax  adjustment will not be the  whole of the interest on the excess  loan  capital,  only  the  additional  costs  associated  with  the  form  of  the loan capital compared to ordinary funding.

**Example 2**

The  Hong  Kong  branch  of  Bank-F,  which  was  incorporated  in  a Jurisdiction-F,  was  funded  by  its  head  office  with  a  loan  of  $900 million at an interest rate of 4% and proceeds of $100 million from the issue of Tier 2 instruments to an associate at an interest rate of 6%.    The head office charged the Hong Kong branch a sum of $15 million as an arm's length arrangement fee and on translating for tax purposes, an exchange loss of $10 million was recorded.

It  is  assumed that the analysis under section 50AAK that the Hong Kong branch should be holding $100 million of equity capital and $40 million of loan capital as Tier 2 capital at 6%.

There  would  be  no  additional  interest  to  be  allowed  on  the  Tier  2 instruments as it was assumed by section 50AAK(4) that that would be reduced from $100 million actually held to $40 million. However, a disallowance would arise in respect of the premium on the $60 million excess loan capital displaced by interest-free equity capital.

The  funding  that  was  displaced  by  equity  capital  and  the  related interest costs would be:

| Type of funding       |   Amount of funding $ million | Interest rate   | Interest $   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Tier 2 instruments    |                            60 | 6%              | 3,600,000    |
| Interest bearing loan |                            40 | 4%              | 1,600,000    |
| Total                 |                           100 |                 | 5,200,000    |

The related costs attributable to the displacement of funding by equity capital would be:

|                        |                   | $         |
|------------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Arrangement fee        | $15 million × 10% | 1,500,000 |
| Exchange loss          | $10 million × 10% | 1,000,000 |
| Costs to be disallowed |                   | 2,500,000 |

Total  amount  of  disallowance  was:  $7,700,000  (i.e.  $5,200,000  + $2,500,000).

38. The  funding  displaced  by  equity  should  represent  longer  term funding which is fulfilling a similar role like equity.    Following the same way, when  attributing  additional  loan  capital,  there  should  not  be  an  automatic presumption  that  the  additional  loan  capital  displaces  the  cheapest  funding, neither should it be presumed that excess loan capital should be replaced by the cheapest overnight funding.    A similar principle to the above applies, namely

that  the  replacement  debt  will  most  likely  be  longer  term  funding  which  is fulfilling a similar role in the funding structure of the permanent establishment, albeit not subordinated.

39. Section 50AAK(6) specifies that no deduction may be made for any costs  in  excess  of  those  that  would  have  been  incurred  if  the  permanent establishment  had  the  equity  and  loan  capital  assumed.    The  term  'cost'  is intentionally  not  limited  in  the  legislation,  except  by  its  context,  to  give  it  a broader meaning than simply interest expense.    In this context, it will restrict to  funding,  funding  related  costs  and  costs  incidental  to  funding.    It  will certainly  include  fees  and  incidental  costs  associated  with  loans.    It  is  also broad enough and intended to catch non-interest funding and funding related costs such as swap payments and premiums, whether related to hedging or used as the primary method of funding, though it must be stressed that all these costs are limited to those part of the costs that relate to funding that is displaced from the permanent establishment by the assumptions on equity and loan capital.

**Example 3**

Bank-F was incorporated in a Jurisdiction-F with which Hong Kong had a DTA.    The foreign bank was a tax resident of Jurisdiction-F under both Hong Kong internal law and the DTA.    It was regulated by  the  banking  regulator  in  Jurisdiction-F .    It  carried  on  business operations  through  a  fixed  place  of  business  in  Hong  Kong  (i.e. Hong  Kong  branch  operations).    The  HKMA  granted  a  restricted banking licence for Hong Kong branch operations.

The Hong Kong branch operations constituted business carried on by  Bank-F  through  a  permanent  establishment  for  the  purposes  of applying the relevant business profits article of the DTA. Accordingly, profits attributable to the Hong Kong branch operations may be taxed by Hong Kong.

Bank-F maintained general reserve liquid assets as required under rules  imposed  by  the  banking  regulator  in  Jurisdiction-F.    The liquid reserve assets of Bank-F comprised assets that qualify as high quality  liquid  assets  (e.g.  certain  government  bonds  and  secured cash deposits).    Bank-F was required to hold a minimum amount or

value  of  liquid  reserve  assets  to  reflect  future  global  net  cash outflows of Bank-F as estimated.

The  liquid  reserve  assets  were  managed  and  controlled  for  use outside  of  Hong  Kong.    Bank-F  derived  interest  and  other  income from the liquid reserve assets.    Bank-F incurred interest expense on borrowings that fund the liquid reserve assets.    The amount of the interest  expense  incurred  exceeded  the  income  derived  from  the liquid reserve assets in the taxable period.

Per  section  49(1C),  the  business  profits  article  of  the  DTA  should have  effect  for  taxing  income,  profits,  gains  and  chargeable  gains attributable  to  business  carried  by  Bank-F  through  its  Hong  Kong permanent  establishment.    In  the  case  of  costs  of  a  foreign  bank carrying on banking business through a permanent establishment, it is also necessary to consider the provisions relating to deductions or restrictions  on  deductions  (e.g.  sections  16  and  17).    In  general, interest expense incurred by foreign bank is deductible under section 16(2) in determining the profits of the foreign bank taxable in Hong Kong under the business profits article of the relevant DTA, to the extent  the  interest  expense  is  incurred  by  the  foreign  bank  in producing  its  chargeable  profits  derived  from/  through  or  from  its business carried on in Hong Kong through its permanent establishment;  and  not  a  loss  or  outgoing  of  capital  or  of  a  capital nature,  and  is  not  of  a  private  or  domestic  nature.    Thus,  interest expense incurred by the foreign bank on its borrowings that fund the bank's general reserve liquid assets, managed and controlled for use outside  Hong  Kong,  should  not  be  allocated  to  Hong  Kong  and claimed  for  deduction  in  ascertaining  the  assessable  profits  of  the permanent establishment.

### Documentary Support for the Authorised OECD Approach (AOA) in Addition to/ Incorporated into the Local File

#### Evidencing compliance with Rule 2

1. The following additional guidance is intended to provide non-Hong Kong  resident  persons  with  permanent  establishments  in  Hong  Kong  on  the documentation  and  records  that  should  be  retained  for the purposes  of evidencing  compliance  with  Rule  2  and  supporting  the  tax  return  filing position.

#### Evidence of high level compliance

2. The documentary information should be prepared and maintained in addition to or incorporated into the body of the local file and/ or master file, the requirements for which are separately detailed in sections 6 and 7 of Schedule 17I.
3. Adequate documentation prepared to evidence high-level compliance with the AOA should include documenting:
