## INTRODUCTION

On  30  June  1998,  the  Chief  Executive  in  Council  made  the Exemption from Profits Tax (Interest Income) Order 1998 under Section 87 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (the Ordinance). The purpose of the Order is to exempt persons other than financial institutions from the payment of profits tax on interest income chargeable under Part IV of the Ordinance.  The Order has been amended by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Ordinance 2004 (the 2004  Amendment  Ordinance),  in  consequence  of  the  amendments  made  to section 16 of the Ordinance.

2. This  Interpretation  and  Practice  Note  sets  out  the  Department's views  on  the  application  of  the  Order,  as  revised  to  reflect  the  amendments made by the 2004 Amendment Ordinance.  In addition, the opportunity is taken to explain the approach the Department will adopt in respect of practical issues arising out of the application of the Order.

## EXEMPT PERSONS

3. Taxpayers exempted from payment of profits tax on interest income to which the Order applies are -
(a) corporations, other than financial institutions, carrying on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong, and
(b) persons,  other  than  corporations,  carrying  on  a  trade, profession  or  business  in  Hong  Kong  where  the  interest income is  in  respect  of  funds  of  the  trade,  profession  or business.

The  exemption  from  the  payment  of  profits  tax  does  not  apply  to  interest income received by financial institutions.

4. A  financial  institution  is  defined  in  section  2  of  the  Ordinance  as being -
- (a) an authorized institution within the meaning of section 2 of the Banking Ordinance (Cap. 155);
- (b) any associated corporation of such an authorized institution which,  being  exempt  by  virtue  of section 3(2)(a) or (b) or (c) of the Banking Ordinance (Cap. 155), would  have  been  liable  to  be  authorized  as  a  deposittaking  company  or  restricted  licence  bank  under  that Ordinance had it not been so exempt.

Section 2 of the Banking Ordinance defines the term 'authorized institution' as meaning a bank, restricted licence bank or deposit taking company.

## BASIS OF EXEMPTION

5. The Order specifies that a taxpayer is exempt from the payment of tax on interest income to which the Order applies.  Accordingly, whilst no tax is  payable  on  the  relevant  interest  income,  the  income  itself  does  not  come within the categorisation of 'exempt'  income. Such  income  therefore continues to retain its underlying characteristic as chargeable profits. Examples of the application of the Order to a number of practical situations are set out in paragraph 14.

## RELEVANT INTEREST INCOME

6. For the purpose of the Order, the relevant interest income is interest income derived from any deposit placed with an authorized institution in Hong Kong by a person to whom the Order applies.  Such person may either be a corporation,  or  a  person  other  than  a  corporation,  carrying  on  a  trade, profession or business in Hong Kong. Where the person is not a corporation, the  interest  income  has  to  be  in  respect  of  funds  of  the  trade,  profession  or business  carrying  on  by  that  person.    It  is  worth  noting  that  interest  income derived  from  solicitors'  clients'  money  does  not  fall  within  the  scope  of  the Order.  This is because clients' money is not funds of the solicitors' profession [see  CIR  v.  Messrs.  Lau,  Wong  &amp;  Chan  Solicitors,  2  HKTC  470] . The currency in which the deposit is denominated is not relevant and there is no requirement for the deposit to be evidenced by a certificate of deposit.

## ASSOCIATED EXPENSES

7. The interest income that is exempt from the payment of tax is the net amount derived by the person as reduced by all attributable  losses,  outgoing and expenses incurred in the production of that interest income.  The general principles embodied in the Ordinance requiring an appropriate adjustment to be made  for  expenses  not  incurred  in  the  production  of  assessable  profits  are applicable to determining the amount of the interest income that is subject to exemption from the payment of tax.  Only the net interest income earned (the interest income received after deduction of attributable costs) is so exempted.
8. Expenses attributable to Hong Kong-sourced interest income will be computed  on  the  same  basis  as  that  applied  to  the  calculation  of  offshore interest income.  The Department's policy as regards adjustments for expenses attributable to the earning of interest income is only to require an adjustment for expenses to be made where there is a direct link between the expenses in question and the interest income in question.  Where the link is merely indirect or incidental, adjustments to expense deductions are not usually required to be made.  Assessors do, however, reserve the right to make adjustments in specific situations  where  the  particular  facts  of  individual  cases  indicate  that  such adjustments are appropriate in the circumstances.

## EFFECTIVE DATE OF ORDER

9. The exemption from payment of tax applies, in respect of a deposit placed  or  renewed  prior  to  22  June  1998, to  the  whole  of the  interest accrued on or after that date .  For any new deposits placed on or after 22 June 1998 or any existing deposit renewed on or after that date, the whole of the  interest  paid on  such  deposit,  when  received  by  a  qualifying  person,  is exempt from the payment of tax.
10. It is well established judicially that interest accrues on a day-to-day basis.  Accordingly, as regards deposits placed prior to 22 June 1998, only the interest that accrued on or after 22 June 1998 will qualify for the exemption.  In particular, any interest that accrued prior to 22 June 1998, whether paid to the taxpayer  before  or  after  the  date,  will  continue  to  be  subject  to  profits  tax. Where the  term  of  a  deposit  straddles  22  June  1998,  it  will  be  necessary  to

apportion  any  interest  received  on  a  'days  before'  and  'days  after'  basis  to ascertain the amount qualifying for exemption under the Order.

11. For  deposits  placed  with  financial  institutions  on  or  after  22  June 1998,  the  whole  of  the  interest  income  received  will  be  exempt  from  the payment of profits tax.

## DEPOSITS AS SECURITY FOR BANKING FACILITIES

12. Any interest  income  arising  on  deposits  that  have  been  pledged  as collateral for financing facilities is not exempt from the payment of tax, if the interest  expenses  incurred  on  the  financing  facilities  are  allowable  for  tax deduction. While the interest expenses deduction scheme has been amended by the 2004 Amendment  Ordinance, the basic principles for granting exemption  from  payment  of  tax  under  this  Order  remain  unchanged.    The positions  on  the  application  of  the  exemption  before  and  after  the  2004 Amendment Ordinance are as follows -

### (a) Before the 2004 Amendment Ordinance

The exemption does not apply to any deposit which is used to secure  or  guarantee  a  loan  of  money  where  the  condition specified  in  the  then  section  16(2)(d)  of  the  Ordinance  is satisfied. In  such  case,  the  interest  income  earned  from  the deposit is chargeable  to tax, while  the interest  expense incurred on the loan is allowable for deduction.  The position remains the same even if there are other securities for the loan or  the  interest  expense  incurred  on  the  loan  is  less  than  the interest  income  earned  from  the  deposit.    The  whole  of  the interest  income  is  chargeable  to  tax  because  the  Order  does not  allow  partial  exemption  for  the  interest  income.  The taxpayer  cannot  give  up  the  interest  expense  deduction  and claim the interest income exemption.

### (b) After the 2004 Amendment Ordinance

The exemption does not apply to any deposit which is used to secure  or  guarantee  a  loan  of  money  where  the  condition under section 16(2)(c), (d) or (e) of the Ordinance is satisfied and the restriction on interest expense deduction under section 16(2A) does not apply. In such case, the interest expense is allowable and the interest income is not exempt from payment of  tax  by  the  Order,  notwithstanding  that  there  are  other securities for the loan or the interest expense incurred on the loan is less than the interest income earned from the deposit. As  before,  partial  exemption  for  the  interest  income  is  not allowed. The  taxpayer  cannot  give  up  the  interest  expense deduction and claim the interest income exemption.

## ADVANCE RULINGS

13. Section  88A  of  the  Ordinance  permits  the  Commissioner,  upon application  from  a  person,  to  make  a  ruling  on  matters  specified  in  Part  I  to Schedule 10 of the Ordinance.  In particular, section 1 of Part I of Schedule 10 provides that the Commissioner may make a ruling on how any provision of the Ordinance applies to the applicant or to the arrangement described in the application. Advance  rulings  may  be  given  in  respect  of  the  application  of Orders made under section 87.

## PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE ORDER

14. As noted above, the Order exempts taxpayers from the payment of profits  tax  on  interest  income  to  which  it  relates.    Notwithstanding  the legislative approach adopted, the practical effect of the Order is to exempt the relevant  interest  income  from  tax. To  ensure  consistency  in  the  basis  of assessment  with  the  situation  that  would  have  prevailed  had  the  relevant interest income been excluded from chargeability, the following practices will be adopted by the Department in finalising assessments -

- (a) The  Order  will  be  applied  to  the  relevant  interest income  as  regards  both  the  final  profits  tax  liability and the provisional profits tax liability.
- (b) In computing the assessable profits of a taxpayer, the relevant  interest  income  will  be  treated  as  'exempt income'.

**Example 1**

|                                                      | ($M)       |

| 1999/2000 Provisional profits tax (3) $11M (4) x 16% | $1,760,000 |
| Total tax payable                                    | $3,520,000 |

- (1) Exemption under section 87 applies to interest accrued on or after  22.6.1998.    Such  interest  income  is  treated  as  exempt income.
- (2) Local deposit interest income treated as exempt income.
- (3) The  exemption  is  extended  to  the  payment  of  provisional profits tax.
- (4) 1999/2000  Provisional  profits  tax  is  based  on  the  assessable profits for 1998/99, which includes $1M interest accrued prior to 22.6.1998.

**Example 2**

For  the  year  ended  31  March  2000,  the  taxpayer  in  Example  1  has  the following assessable profits -

|                            |   ($M) |
|----------------------------|--------|
| Assessable trading profits |     11 |
| Local deposit interest (1) |      5 |

|                                               | $0                    |
| Provisional profits tax 2000/2001 $11M x 16%  | $1,760,000            |
| Total tax payable                             | $1,760,000            |

(c) For loss set-off purposes, relevant interest income will be treated as 'exempt income'.

(1) Local deposit interest income treated as exempt income.

(d) As  relevant  interest  income  is  treated  as  'exempt income', applications for the holding over of 1998/99 provisional tax (or any subsequent year of provisional tax for that matter) in respect of that income may be made if the  assessable  profits  for  the  1998/99  year  of assessment  (excluding  the  relevant  interest  income) are, estimated or are likely to be, less than 90% of the assessable profits on which the provisional profits tax has been charged.

**Example 7**

For the year ended   31.3.1998, the taxpayer has the following assessable profits -

|                                                        | ($M)       |

| Assessable profits for 1997/98                         | 14         |
| 1997/98 Final profits tax $14M x 16.5%                 | $2,310,000 |
| 1998/99 Provisional profits tax for 1998/99 $14M x 16% | $2,240,000 |

In January 1999, the taxpayer estimates that its assessable profits for the year ended 31 March 1999 will be -

$3M x 16%

$480,000

- (1) The interest of $3M earned on or after 22 June 1998  is treated as  exempt income.   The  estimated  1998/99  assessable  profits are  therefore  less  than  90%  of  the  1997/98  assessable  profits and provisional tax charged on the relevant income can be held over.
