## INTRODUCTION

### Background

In  recent  years,  given  the  expansion  of  their  business  in  Asia, particularly Mainland China, as a key growth and revenue-generating market, more and more multinational corporations are considering to establish global and regional corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in the region.    The external volatility in the global financial environment has generated greater demands for  these  corporations  to  centralise  their  groups'  treasury  management  of liquidity  and  risks,  as  well  as  hedging  transactions  so  as  to  achieve  greater operational efficiency.

2. As an international financial centre, Hong Kong offers an extensive banking  network,  deep  capital  markets,  robust  financial  infrastructure,  and effective  professional  services  crucial  for  corporations  to  establish  their regional CTCs and expand their business presence in Asia.    Enhancing Hong Kong's global competitiveness in attracting corporate treasury activities will help strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre and create demands for the financial and professional services sectors.
3. In  essence,  a  CTC  is  an  'in-house  bank'  within  a  multinational corporation focusing on the optimal procurement and usage of capital for the operations  of  the  entire  group.    Typical  CTCs  perform  the  functions  of intra-group financing, optimising multi-currency cash  management  and liquidity management,  cash pooling, central or regional processing of payments  to  vendors  or  suppliers for the corporate  group,  conducting transactions for financial or treasury-related risk management, and supporting the raising of capital by the group.
4. Before the enactment of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2016 (the 2016 Amendment (No. 2) Ordinance), interest deduction rules were relatively less favourable for multinational corporations to engage in intra-group borrowing and lending of funds with other associated corporations  outside  Hong  Kong.    If  a  corporation  obtained  a  loan  from  a non-financial  institution  in  the  ordinary  course  of  its  intra-group  financing

business, the interest expense was deductible provided that the corresponding interest income of that non-financial institution was chargeable to Hong Kong profits tax.    From the perspective of CTCs located in Hong Kong engaging in an intra-group financing business, its interest expense payable to associated corporations  outside  Hong  Kong  (being  non-financial  institutions  whose profits  are  not  subject  to  Hong  Kong  tax)  was  not  deductible,  whereas  the interest income arising from its intra-group financing business was chargeable to profits tax.

5. The Financial Secretary announced in the 2015-2016 Budget that, to attract multinational and Mainland enterprises to establish CTCs in Hong Kong  to  perform  treasury  services  for  their  group  companies,  the  Inland Revenue  Ordinance  (the  Ordinance)  would  be  amended  to  allow,  under specified conditions, interest deductions with respect to profits tax for CTCs, and to reduce the profits tax for specified treasury activities by 50 per cent.
6. On  26  May  2016,  the Legislative Council passed the  2016 Amendment  (No.  2)  Ordinance  to  implement  the  budget  proposal.    The purpose of this Note is to set out in detail the Department's views and practice on  the  tax  treatments  in  relation  to  the  interest  income  and  expenses  for intra-group financing business as well as the profits tax concession granted to qualifying corporate treasury centres (QCTCs).

### The 2016 Amendment (No. 2) Ordinance

7. The 2016 Amendment (No. 2) Ordinance amended the Ordinance to give profits tax concession to QCTCs and to make provisions for profits tax purposes  regarding  interests  on  money  borrowed  from  or  lent  to  associated corporations.    The main provisions relating to QCTCs and the borrowing and lending of money with associated corporations are as follows:

Profits tax concession for QCTCs

- (a) Section 14C(1) is added to provide for the interpretation of terms for the QCTC profits tax concession, such as corporate treasury  service,  corporate  treasury  transaction,  intra-group financing business and qualifying profits.

- (b) Section  14C(5)  is  added  to  empower  the  Secretary  for Financial  Services  and  the  Treasury  to  amend  by  order published  in  the  Gazette  certain  definitions,  which  are specified in Schedule 17B.
- (c)        Section 14D is added to provide for the QCTC profits tax concession -
    - (i) Section  14D(1)  provides  that  a  corporation  that  is  a QCTC for a year of assessment is entitled to have its qualifying profits for that year of assessment charged at one-half of the profits tax rate specified in Schedule 8 to the Ordinance.
    - (ii) Section  14D(2)  provides  for  how  a  corporation  may be a QCTC, that is -
        - by  satisfying  the  conditions  specified  in  section 14D(3);
        - by  satisfying  the  safe  harbour  rule  under  section 14E; or
        - by obtaining the determination of the Commissioner  of  Inland  Revenue  under  section 14F(1).
        - A  financial  institution  is,  however,  not  eligible  to  be  a QCTC by virtue of section 14D(9).
    - (iii)    Section 14D(5) is added to provide certain conditions other  than  being  a  QCTC  for  the  entitlement  to  the concessionary rate.
- (d) Section 14E is added to provide for how a corporation may satisfy  the  safe  harbour  rule  under  section  14E(1).    There are two alternative safe harbours -
    - (i) The '1-year safe harbour' in section 14E(2) requires the corporation to satisfy certain conditions regarding its  corporate  treasury  profits  and  corporate  treasury assets for the year of assessment concerned.
    - (ii) The  'multiple-year  safe  harbour'  in  section  14E(3) requires the corporation  to  satisfy certain similar conditions for the year of assessment and the preceding one or two years of assessment.
- (e) Section  14F  is  added  to  provide  for  the  Commissioner's discretion  to  make  a  determination  that  a  corporation  that satisfies  neither  the  conditions  specified  in  section  14D(3) nor the safe harbour rule under section 14E is a QCTC for the year of assessment concerned.
- (f) Section  19CA  is  amended  to  include  the  case  where  the concessionary rate is applicable in the adjustment mechanism provided under that section.
- (g) Schedule 17B is added to define corporate treasury service and corporate treasury transaction and to specify the prescribed profits percentage and the prescribed asset percentage for the safe harbour rule.

Interest on money borrowed from / lent to associated corporations

- (h) Section  15(1)(ia)  and  (la)  is  added  to  make  it  clear  that interest  and  gains  received  by  or  accrued  to  a  corporation, other  than  a  financial  institution,  which  arise  through  or from the carrying on of its intra-group financing business in Hong Kong have a Hong Kong source regardless of whether the  moneys  concerned  are  made  available  outside  Hong Kong.

- (i) Section  16(2)(g)  is  added  to  provide  for  the  deduction  in respect of interest payable by a corporation that is carrying on in Hong Kong an intra-group financing business on money borrowed from its non-Hong Kong associated corporation.
- (j) Section  16(2CA)  and  (2CC)  is  added  to  provide  for  two anti-avoidance  provisions  specific  to  the  deduction  under section 16(2)(g).

## MONEY BORROWED FROM ASSOCIATED CORPORATIONS

### Conditions specified in section 16(2)(g)

8. The interest  deduction  rule  in  section  16(2)(g)  allows  a  corporate borrower  carrying  on  in  Hong  Kong  an  intra-group  financing  business deduction  of  interest  payable  on  money  borrowed  from  a  non-Hong  Kong associated  corporation  under  specified  conditions.    Though  the  rule  in section 16(2)(g) is not confined to a QCTC as defined under section 14D, the corporation  must  be  carrying  on  in  Hong  Kong  an  intra-group  financing business.    The specified conditions in section 16(2)(g) are:
- (a)        the deduction claimed is in respect of interest payable by a corporation (i.e. the borrower) on money borrowed from a non-Hong  Kong  associated  corporation  (i.e.  the  lender)  in the ordinary course of an intra-group financing business;
- (b)        the lender is, in respect of the interest, subject to a similar tax (i.e. such tax has been paid or will be paid) in a territory outside  Hong  Kong  at  a  rate  that  is  not  lower  than  the reference rate; and
- (c)      the  lender's  right  to  use  and  enjoy  that  interest  is  not constrained by a contractual or legal obligation to pass that interest to any other person, unless the obligation arises as a result of a transaction between the lender and a person other than the borrower dealing with each other at arm's length.

The term 'intra-group financing business', in relation to a corporation, means the  business  of  the  borrowing  of  money  from  and  lending  of  money  to  its associated corporations.    The term 'non-Hong Kong associated corporation' means an associated corporation that does not carry on any trade, profession or  business  in  Hong  Kong.    Generally,  if  an  associated  corporation  merely maintains a bank account in Hong Kong without any other business operation in Hong Kong, it would not be regarded as carrying on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong.

### Intra-group financing business

9. The  corporation  carrying  on  an  intra-group  financing  business  is borrowing money from and lending money to its associated corporations in the ordinary course of its business.    That is, the corporation borrows money from and lends money to its associated corporations regularly as a business with  a  view  to  earning  an  interest  margin.    The  deduction  rule  in  section 16(2)(g) would not apply to a corporation which borrows and lends money in isolated  transactions.    Whether  a  corporation  is  carrying  on  an  intra-group financing  business  is  a  question  of  fact.    The  principles  explained  in Shun Lee  Investment  Co.  Ltd.  v  CIR, [1967]  HKLR  712  and CIR  v  Chinachem Finance Co. Ltd., [1993] 1 HKLR 136 are of relevance.    Regard shall be had to all the relevant facts, including:
- (a) the frequency, repetitiveness and the amount of the borrowing  from  and  lending  to  associated  corporations  of money;
- (b) whether there is borrowing from and lending to associated corporations of money at commercial rates of interest;
- (c) whether there is a degree of system and continuity of laying out and getting back of the loan of money by way of interest and repayment of principal;
- (d) the regularity and frequency of the payment of interest and repayment of principal;

- (e) whether  a  profit  is  earned  out  of  the  interest  differential between the borrowing and lending; and
- (f) whether the interest charged on the borrowing and lending is on an arm's length basis.
10. To  constitute  an  intra-group  financing  business,  there  must  be  a sufficient  number  of  intra-group  borrowing  and  lending  transactions  with  a number of associated corporations, involving not an insignificant amount of funds having regard to the nature and scale of the business operations of the multinational  corporation.    The  intra-group  financing  business  can  rely  on funding through various sources (e.g. bank finance or equity).    Generally, the Commissioner would accept that a corporation is carrying on an intra-group financing business if:
- (a) the corporation has not less than four borrowing or lending transactions each month;
- (b) each  borrowing  or  lending  transaction  exceeds  $250,000; and
- (c) borrowing or lending transactions are with not less than four associated corporations in the relevant basis period.

Failure  to  reach  the  benchmark,  however,  would  not  necessarily  lead  to  the conclusion  that  the  corporation  is  not  carrying  on  an  intra-group  financing business.

11. The reference to 'an intra-group financing business' instead of 'the intra-group  financing  business'  in  section  16(2)(g)  means  that  the  money borrowing  and  lending  business  may  not  be  the  only  business  that  the corporation carries on in Hong Kong.    That is, the corporation may carry on other businesses as well.

### In the ordinary course of intra-group financing business

12. Section 16(2)(g)(i) stipulates that the interest claimed for deduction

must  be  payable  by  the  corporation  on  money  borrowed  from  a  non-Hong Kong  associated corporation in the ordinary course of its intra-group financing business.    Money borrowed for purposes other than on-lending the same to other associated corporations is not money borrowed in the ordinary course  of  an  intra-group  financing  business  and  the  relevant  interest  would not be allowed for deduction.

### Interest paid to non-corporate associates outside Hong Kong

13. Interest  paid  to  non-corporate  associates  outside  Hong  Kong  (e.g. partnerships,  trusts)  will  not  be  allowed  for  deduction.    The  deduction  rule under  section  16(2)(g)  only  applies  to  interest  paid  to  non-Hong  Kong associated  corporations.    This  requirement  is  to  prevent  double  deduction claims or the shifting of interest to another entity through a hybrid entity or an entity considered as transparent in an overseas territory.

### Subject to tax condition

#### Tax motivated loan transactions

14. Section  16(2)(g)(ii)  requires  that  the  lender  is,  in  respect  of  the interest  income,  subject  to  tax  (similar  to  profits  tax  in  Hong  Kong)  in  a territory outside Hong Kong at a rate not lower than Hong Kong's profits tax rate.    This  prevents  tax  avoidance  opportunities  in  which  a  corporation arranges  artificial  loan  transactions  generating  interest  expenses,  deductible under section 16(2)(g), with a lending associated corporation situated in a tax jurisdiction charging ultra-low or even zero rate for the profits derived from the interest income.    In the absence of withholding tax and thin capitalisation rules  in  Hong  Kong,  this  requirement  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  the provisions in section 16 would not be seen by other tax jurisdictions as tax base erosion or as encouraging multinational companies to arrange transactions subject to double non-taxation.    It strikes a reasonable balance in  facilitating  tax  deduction  by  companies  and  mitigating  risks  of  tax avoidance.

#### Tax paid or will be paid

15. Under section 16(2)(g)(ii), the deduction of the interest will only be allowed  if  the  lender  is  subject  to  tax  in  respect  of  the  interest  received. Even though the interest may be included as the income of the lender in the statement  of  income  for  a  taxable  year  or  period,  the  lender  cannot  be regarded as being subject to tax in respect of the interest if the interest has been  reduced  to  nil  or  a  negative  figure  by  direct  expenses,  including  the interest expense incurred to produce the interest income.    Section 16(2I)(a) clarifies  that  the  lender  is  regarded  as  having  been  subject  to  tax  if  tax  has been paid or will be paid in respect of the interest as required by the laws of that territory.    Given that the interest received by the lender may be taxed in a  taxable  period  which  ends  after  that  of  the  borrower  in  Hong  Kong,  the condition is accepted as having been satisfied if tax payment will be made by the  lender  in  that  taxable  period.    While  immediate  tax  payment  is  not required,  there  should  be  a  reasonable  degree  of  certainty  that  tax  payment will  be  made.    Sufficient  evidence  (e.g.  audited  financial  statements,  tax computations, tax assessments, etc.) must be provided upon request to prove that  tax  payment  will  be  made  in  that  taxable  period  which  ends  after  the taxable  period  of  the  borrower  in  Hong  Kong  if  that  is  the  case.    If information received after deduction shows that the lender is not required to make  any  tax  payment,  an  additional  assessment  under  section  60  will  be raised to withdraw the deduction previously allowed.

**Example 1**

On 30 November Year 1, Corporation-HK paid interest of $500,000 on  money  borrowed  from  Corporation-F,  its  non-Hong  Kong associated  corporation  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F ,  in  the  ordinary course  of  its  intra-group  financing  business.    The  taxable  period of  Corporation-HK  ended  on  31  December  Year  1  whereas  the taxable period of Corporation-F  ended  on  30  June  Year  2. Corporation-F paid corporation tax at a rate of 30% in Jurisdiction-F  in  the  taxable  period  ended  on  30  June  Year  2  in respect of its profits, including the interest of $500,000.

Tax payment was made by Corporation-F in respect of the interest

income after profits tax assessment had been raised on Corporation-HK.    The  'subject  to  tax'  condition  under  section 16(2)(g)(ii)  would  be  accepted  as  having  been  satisfied  if  at  the time  of  raising  the  profits  tax  assessment  on  Corporation-HK,  it could be reasonably foreseen that Corporation-F would be required to  pay  tax  in  respect  of  the  interest  at  a  rate  not  less  than  the reference  rate.    If  Corporation-F  was  subsequently  found  not required  to  make  tax  payment  in  respect  of  the  interest  income, Corporation-HK should notify the Assessor immediately so that an additional assessment could be made to disallow the deduction of the interest expense.

#### Losses

16. The interest which accrues to the lender may be assessed as part of the profits or income of the lender for a taxable year or period.    Therefore, it is necessary to address the situation whereby the interest is reduced by losses or the lender is in an overall loss situation for that taxable year or period.    If the  lender  has  losses,  the  general  assumption  is  that  the  losses  current  or brought  forward  have  set  off  other  business  profits  or  income  first.    After deducting  the  losses,  if  tax  is  payable  on  the  balance  of  profits  or  income, which includes the interest income, the lender is considered as being subject to  tax  in  respect  of  that  interest.    It  is  also  assumed  that  the  interest  in question has not been reduced to nil or a negative figure by direct expenses, including interest  expense  to  produce  the  interest.    In  the  below  situations, the 'subject to tax' condition would not be regarded as having been satisfied:

- (a) the  lender  incurs  a  substantial  loss  for  the  taxable  year  or period and tax is not paid or payable for that taxable year or period;
- (b) the lender has losses, brought forward or related back from other taxable years or periods, which exceed the profits or income for the taxable year or period in which the interest accrues and tax is not paid or payable for that taxable year or period;

- (c) the  lender  though  having profits  or  income  for  the  taxable year or period in which the interest accrues is not required to  pay  tax  in  respect  of  such  profits  or  income  because  of relief for group losses; or
- (d) the  interest  has  been  reduced  to  nil  or  a  loss  by  direct expenses, including interest expense incurred to produce the interest income (i.e. the lender has made no profit or a loss in  respect  of  the  money  lent  to  the  borrower) though  the lender has profits or income for the taxable year or period in which the interest accrues.
17. As  a  rule,  the  borrower  must  not  make  use  of  the  losses  of associated  corporations,  whether  resident  in  Hong  Kong  or  elsewhere,  to reduce  its  profits  tax  liabilities  by  making  tax-driven  interest  payments  to those associated corporations. For tax-driven loan transactions, the Commissioner would invoke section 16(2CC) to disallow interest deduction where  losses  are  utilised  to  avoid  profits  tax  liabilities  of  the  borrower  or another person.    To determine whether a loan is driven by tax motives where the  interest  is  reduced  by  losses,  consideration  has  to  be  made  to  all  the relevant factors, including:
- (a) the  terms,  including  quantum  and  dates  of  payment  or repayment, on which the lending was made;
- (b) the circumstances, in particular the source of funds and use of funds, under which the lending was made;
- (c) the  circumstances  under  which  the  loss  was  incurred  and whether  the  loss  was  expected  or  already  incurred  at  the time or before the lending was made;
- (d) the  time  when  the  loss  was  incurred  (e.g.  whether  it  was incurred in the current year or it was brought forward from previous years); and
- (e) the amount of loss and the quantum of tax payment after the profits were set off by the loss.

**Example 2**

Corporation-HK  paid  interest  of  $1,000,000  on  money  borrowed from  Corporation-F,  its  non-Hong  Kong  associated  corporation resident in Jurisdiction-F, in the ordinary course of its intra-group financing business.    Though the headline tax rate in Jurisdiction-F was  25%,  Corporation-F  paid  no  tax  in  Jurisdiction-F  in  the taxable year in which the interest accrued because Corporation-F was in a tax loss position for that year (i.e. the interest income was fully  set  off  by  losses  brought  forward  from  earlier  years  or  by losses incurred in the current taxable year).

Since Corporation-F was not required to make any tax payment in respect of the interest income, the 'subject to tax' condition under section 16(2)(g)(ii) was not satisfied.    The interest of $1,000,000 could not be claimed  for  deduction  by  Corporation-HK.    If Corporation-F was subject to tax in respect of a net taxable profit and  the  interest  income  included  thereunder  remained  a  positive figure  after  deducting  the  direct  interest  expense  to  produce  the interest  income,  the  interest  income  would  be  regarded  as  having been subject to tax in Jurisdiction-F.

**Example 3**

In  Year  1,  Corporation-HK  paid  interest  of  $200,000  on  money borrowed from Corporation-F , its non-Hong Kong associated corporation  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F ,  in  the  ordinary  course  of  its intra-group financing business carried on in Hong Kong. Corporation-F paid income tax in Jurisdiction-F at 25% on its profits which  included  the  interest  of  $200,000.    Corporation-HK  was  thus allowed deduction of that interest under section 16(2)(g) for Year 1. In  Year  2,  Corporation-F  incurred  a  tax  loss  which  was  carried backward to Year 1 to set off its previously earned profits under the tax law in Jurisdiction-F and got a full refund of the tax paid for Year 1.

In the above circumstances, the 'subject to tax' condition was not satisfied as the tax paid on the interest of $200,000 had been fully refunded  to  Corporation-F.    The  Commissioner  would  raise  an additional assessment on Corporation-HK to withdraw the interest deduction previously allowed.

#### Not lower than the reference rate

18. The  rate  at  which  the  interest  is  charged  in  the  lender's  territory should not be lower than  the  reference  rate  (i.e.  16.5%  or  8.25%  if  section 14D(1) is applicable).    This will avoid tax rate arbitrage in cases where the actual rate is much lower than Hong Kong tax rate, or where the jurisdiction outside Hong Kong offers other tax incentives or exemption, etc.    While the way the rate is determined is not specified, it should be clear that it is the rate at  which  tax  is  actually  charged  on  the  interest.    In  case  the  interest  forms part of the lender's taxable profits of a taxable year or period in its jurisdiction of residence, comparison should be made with the tax rate applicable to the taxable profits under the domestic laws of that jurisdiction. If the jurisdiction  outside  Hong  Kong  of  which  the  lender  is  resident  adopts  a progressive tax system, the average rate at which tax is actually charged on the taxable profits, including the interest, will be taken as the rate of tax for the purpose of section 16(2)(g)(ii).    In practice, in the absence of any motive to avoid tax, if the tax rate calculated is lower than the reference rate by not more than 10%, the Commissioner would consider to treat this condition as having been satisfied.

**Example 4**

Corporation-HK  borrowed  a  loan  of  $8m  for  three  months  from Corporation-F, a non-Hong Kong associated corporation resident in Jurisdiction-F, in the ordinary course of its intra-group financing business carried on in Hong Kong.    Under the terms of the loan, Corporation-F was paid an interest of $100,000 by Corporation-HK.    Corporation-F  was  not  a  conduit  or  nominee company, having full right to use and enjoy the interest of $100,000. In the taxable period in which the interest was earned, Corporation-F was required to pay corporation tax in

Jurisdiction-F  at  a  rate  of  25%  on  its  profits  which  included  the interest of $100,000.

The conditions in section 16(2)(g)(i) and (iii) were satisfied since the loan was borrowed from a non-Hong Kong associated corporation  in  the  ordinary  course  of  an  intra-group  financing business  and  Corporation-F  had  full  right  to  use  and  enjoy  the interest.    The  condition  in  section  16(2)(g)(ii)  was  also  satisfied since Corporation-F was subject to tax at 25% which was not lower than  the  Hong  Kong  reference  rate  of  16.5%.    Therefore,  the interest of $100,000 paid by Corporation-HK could be allowed for deduction under section 16(2)(g).

**Example 5**

CTC-HK, a QCTC, borrowed a loan of $10m for six months from Corporation-F1, a non-Hong Kong associated corporation resident in Jurisdiction-F1, for on-lending to Corporation-F2, a non-Hong Kong  associated  corporation  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F2,  in  the ordinary course of an intra-group financing business carried on in Hong Kong.    Under the terms of the loan, CTC-HK paid interest of  $200,000  to  Corporation-F1.    To  fund  the  loan  made  to CTC-HK,  Corporation-F1  incurred  a  direct  interest  expense  of $150,000,  thus  earning  an  interest  spread  of  $50,000.    In  the taxable  period  in  which  the  interest  was  earned,  Jurisdiction-F1 charged interest tax on the interest spread at progressive rates with the first $30,000 taxed at 8% and the remaining balance taxed at 16%.    The tax paid by Corporation-F1 was $5,600 (i.e. $30,000 × 8% + $20,000 × 16%).

Since CTC-HK was a QCTC and the loan to Corporation-F2 was a qualifying  lending  transaction,  the  reference  rate  should  be  8.25%. The condition in section 16(2)(g)(ii) was satisfied since Corporation-F1 was subject to tax in Jurisdiction-F1 at a rate of 11.2% (i.e.  $5,600 ÷ ($200,000 -$150,000) × 100%) which was not lower than the reference rate of 8.25%.    Thus, CTC-HK could be allowed deduction of the interest expense of $200,000 under section 16(2)(g).

If the interest income and interest expense were brought to account when  computing  the  taxable  profits  of  Corporation-F1  for  the taxable  period  in  which  the  interest  income  accrued,  reference could be made to the tax rate applied to the taxable profits.

**Example 6**

CTC-HK, a QCTC, borrowed a loan of $30m for one month from Corporation-F1 resident in Jurisdiction-F1 for on-lending to Corporation-F2 resident in Jurisdiction-F2 in the ordinary course of its intra-group financing business.    Under the terms of the loan, CTC-HK paid Corporation-F1  an  interest  of  $150,000.    To  fund the  loan  made  to  CTC-HK,  Corporation-F1  incurred  interest expenses  of  $100,000.    The  profit  earned  by  Corporation-F1  for the loan was $50,000.    Jurisdiction-F1 adopted a progressive tax system for its interest tax under which the first $40,000 was taxed at  7%  while  the  remaining  was  taxed  at  13%.    The  tax  paid  by Corporation-F1 was $4,100 (i.e. $40,000 × 7% + $10,000 × 13%).

Corporation-F1 was subject to tax at a rate of 8.2% (i.e. $4,100 ÷ ($150,000 -$100,000) × 100%).    Since the rate of tax was lower than  the  reference  rate  of  8.25%  applicable  to  CTC-HK  by  not more  than  10%,  the  Commissioner  would  consider  to  accept  the 'subject to tax' condition as having been fulfilled in the absence of any evidence of tax avoidance.

**Example 7**

In Year 1, Corporation-HK paid interest of $480,000 (i.e. $40,000 each month) on money borrowed from Corporation-F, its non-Hong Kong  associated  corporation  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F,  in  the ordinary course of its intra-group financing business.    The taxable period of Corporation-HK ended on 31 December Year 1 whereas the  taxable  period  of  Corporation-F  ended  on  30  June  Year  2. Corporation-F paid corporation tax at a rate of 30% and 10% in Jurisdiction-F in the taxable periods ended on 30 June Year 1 and Year 2 respectively.

In the taxable period ended on 30 June Year 1, interest income of $240,000 accrued to Corporation-F was subject to corporation tax at a rate of 30%.    The 'subject to tax' condition was satisfied.    In the  taxable  period  ended  on  30  June  Year  2,  interest  income  of $240,000 accrued to Corporation-F was subject to corporation tax at a rate of 10%.    The 'subject to tax' condition was not satisfied. Therefore,  only  $240,000  of  the  interest  expense  incurred  by Corporation-HK  would  be  allowed  for  deduction  under  section 16(2)(g),  assuming  the  other  conditions  had  also  been  satisfied. Since the interest income accrued evenly over the year, it would not be  correct  to  deny  the  deduction  of  the  whole  of  the  interest expense.    By  parity  of  reasoning,  it  would  be  wrong  to  allow deduction of the whole of the interest expense on the ground that the average rate was 20%.

**Example 8**

O C in bu pa C C pe ad th fro of 30 n  1  January  Year  1,  Corporation-HK  borrowed  a  loan  from orporation-F, its non-Hong Kong associated corporation resident Jurisdiction-F, in the ordinary course of its intra-group financing siness.    Under the terms of the loan, Corporation-HK agreed to y interest of $480,000 (i.e. $40,000 each month) to orporation-F  on  31  December  Year  1.    The  taxable  period  of orporation-HK ended on 31 December Year 1 whereas the taxable riod of Corporation-F ended on 30 June Year 2.    Jurisdiction-F opted an accrual basis for corporation tax purpose.    It reduced e corporation tax rate from 20% to 10% starting from Year 1 (i.e. m 1 July Year 1).    Corporation-F paid corporation tax at a rate 20% and 10% in Jurisdiction-F in the taxable periods ended on June Year 1 and Year 2 respectively.

Although the whole sum of interest income of $480,000 was only received by Corporation-F at the time the tax rate had been already reduced  to  10%,  this  does  not  mean  that  the  interest  expense incurred  by  Corporation-HK  had  to  be  fully  disallowed.    It  is necessary to ascertain the quantum of the interest income accrued to Corporation-F in each taxable period for the purpose of section

1 a i t i t e d h i $ c 6(2)(g)(ii) since Jurisdiction-F assessed the interest income on an ccrual  basis.    In  the  taxable  period  ended  on  30  June  Year  1, nterest income of $240,000 accrued to Corporation-F was subject o corporation tax at a rate of 20%.    The 'subject to tax' condition was  satisfied.    In  the  taxable  period  ended  on  30  June  Year  2, nterest income of $240,000 accrued to Corporation-F was subject o corporation tax at a rate of 10%.    The 'subject to tax' condition was  not satisfied. Therefore, only $240,000  of the interest xpense incurred by Corporation-HK would be allowed for eduction  under  section  16(2)(g),  assuming  the  other  conditions ad  also  been  satisfied.    If  Jurisdiction-F  assessed  the  interest ncome  on  a  cash  basis,  the  whole  sum  of  interest  income  of 480,000  would  be  taxed  at  10%.    Then  the  'subject  to  tax' ondition would not be satisfied.

19. I the interest, paid over t reference ra f  the interest, after deducting direct expenses incurred to produce is  partly  reduced by losses, the effective rate (i.e. the actual tax he net interest income) shall be adopted for comparison with the te for the purpose of section 16(2)(g)(ii).

**Example 9**

f r fi a (i l n 2 Corporation-HK  paid  interest  of  $1,000,000  on  money  borrowed rom  Corporation-F,  its  non-Hong  Kong  associated  corporation esident in Jurisdiction-F, in the ordinary course of its intra-group nancing  business.    In  the  taxable  year  in  which  the  interest ccrued, Corporation-F earned taxable profits of $2,000,000 ncluding the interest of $1,000,000) before set-off by accumulated osses of $1,500,000.    Corporation-F paid tax of $125,000 on the et  taxable  profits  of  $500,000  in  Jurisdiction-F  at  the  flat  rate 5% for that year.

L o r r osses  of  $1,000,000  were  assumed  to  have  fully  set  off  other perating  profits.    The  balance  of  $500,000  was  then  used  to educe the interest income of $1,000,000 giving a sum of $500,000 which  was  subject  to  tax.    The  rate  for  comparison  with  the eference rate under section 16(2)(g)(ii) was 12.5% (i.e. $125,000 ÷

$1,000,000 × 100%).    As the tax rate was lower than the reference rate,  the  'subject  to  tax'  condition  under  section  16(2)(g)(ii)  was not satisfied.    The interest of $1,000,000 could not be claimed for deduction by Corporation-HK.

### Specific regimes and reliefs

#### Permanent establishment

20. Generally,  the  rate  in  section  16(2)(g)(ii)  shall  be  determined  in accordance  with  the  income  tax  principles  of  the  jurisdiction  in  which  the lender is tax resident. If the interest is attributed to a permanent establishment  of  the  lender  located  outside  its  jurisdiction  of  residence,  a holistic  analysis  is  required.    Reference  shall  be  made  to  the  income  tax principles  of  the  jurisdiction  in  which  the  lender  is  resident  and  of  the jurisdiction in which the permanent establishment is located.

**Example 10**

Corporation-HK paid interest of $500,000 on a loan borrowed from Corporation-F1, its non-Hong Kong associated corporation resident in Jurisdiction-F1, in the ordinary course of its intra-group financing  business.    The  loan  was  borrowed  from  the  permanent establishment of Corporation-F1 located in Jurisdiction-F2. Corporation-F1 was subject to corporation tax at a rate of 10% in Jurisdiction-F1 while the permanent establishment was subject to corporation tax at a rate of 25% in Jurisdiction-F2. Jurisdiction-F1 assessed profits of Corporation-F1 on a worldwide basis and the profits attributable to the permanent establishment in Jurisdiction-F2 were assessed to tax in Jurisdiction-F1 subject to a tax credit without any cap.

The 'subject to tax' condition was not satisfied since the interest was in effect assessable to tax at a rate of 10% with the provision of the tax credit.    If  the  tax  credit  was  subject  to  a  cap  of  10%,  the interest would in effect be taxed at a rate of 25% in Jurisdiction-F2 and the 'subject to tax' condition was satisfied.    If Jurisdiction-F1

operated  a  territorial  basis  of  taxation  for  corporations  and  the profits  of  the  permanent  establishment  in  Jurisdiction-F2  were exempt from tax in Jurisdiction-F1, the interest would in effect be taxed at a rate 25% in Jurisdiction-F2.

**Example 11**

Corporation-HK borrowed a loan of $10m for six months from a branch in Jurisdiction-F2 established by Corporation-F1, a non-Hong Kong associated corporation resident in Jurisdiction-F1, in the ordinary course of its intra-group financing business carried on in Hong Kong.    Under the terms of the loan, Corporation-F1 was paid an interest of $300,000 by Corporation-HK. Jurisdiction-F1 adopted a worldwide corporation tax system under which profits from residents' foreign branches would be taxed.    In the taxable year in which the interest was earned, Corporation-F1 was required to pay corporation tax in Jurisdiction-F1 at a rate of 25%  on  its  worldwide  profits  which  included  the  interest of $300,000.    However, the branch was not required to pay any tax on such interest in Jurisdiction-F2.

Though  the  interest  of  $300,000  was  attributable  to  a  permanent establishment in Jurisdiction-F2, the income tax principles applicable to Corporation-F1 in Jurisdiction-F1 need to be considered  as  well.    In  this  particular  case,  the  rate  used  for comparison with the Hong Kong reference rate for the purpose of section 16(2)(g)(ii) should be 25%  which was the rate in Jurisdiction-F1.    The 'subject to tax' condition was considered to have been satisfied.

#### Refund of tax paid under a tax treaty

21. Many  jurisdictions  allow  a  resident  corporation  to  receive  a  tax credit or refund if it has paid tax on the same income in the source jurisdiction with  which  they  have  a  tax  treaty.    Irrespective  of  the  tax  rate  the  treaty partner charges on the income, a resident corporation is only required to pay tax on the same income at the rate imposed by its jurisdiction of residence.

Though the lender has paid tax on the interest in a source jurisdiction at a rate higher than the reference rate, the lender can lodge a claim in its jurisdiction of  residence  for  a  tax  credit  or  refund  equal  to  the  tax  paid  in  the  source jurisdiction.    Under  the  circumstances,  the  lender  would  be  regarded  as having  been  subject  to  tax  on  the  interest  at  the  rate  imposed  by  the jurisdiction of residence.

#### Preferential regime

22. In the case of a regime that provides for a preferential tax rate only, the  tax  rate  for  the  purpose  of  section  16(2)(g)(ii)  will  be  such  preferential rate.    In the case of a regime that provides for a permanent reduction in the tax base only, the tax rate will equal the statutory tax rate generally applicable in  the  jurisdiction  to  corporations  subject  to  the  regime  in  question  less  the product  of  such  tax  rate  and  the  percentage  reduction  in  the  tax  base. Therefore, a regime that provides for a 20% reduction in a corporation's tax base would have a tax rate equal to the applicable statutory rate of corporation tax  reduced  by  20%  of  such  statutory  rate.    In  the  case  of  a  regime  that provides for both a preferential tax rate and a reduction in the tax base, the tax rate would be based on the preferential tax rate reduced by the product of such rate and the percentage reduction in the tax base.

#### Exemption regime

23. In  the  case  of  a  regime  that  provides  for  exemption  of  interest income or interest derived from a source outside that jurisdiction, the lender would be regarded as not being subject to tax in respect of the interest.

#### Transfer pricing adjustment

24. If  a  transfer  pricing  adjustment  is  made  in  respect  of  the  interest received by the lender by the jurisdiction in which the lender is resident, the adjustment should be ignored when determining the applicable tax rate for the purpose  of  section  16(2)(g)(ii).    The  tax  rate  for  the  purpose  of  section 16(2)(g)(ii) is the tax, which would have been paid by the lender without the transfer pricing adjustment, divided by the interest charged by the lender.

**Example 12**

In Year 1, Corporation-HK paid interest of $5m on a loan of $100m borrowed  from  Corporation-F,  its  non-Hong  Kong  associated corporation resident in Jurisdiction-F, in the ordinary course of its intra-group  financing  business.    Corporation-F  was  subject  to corporation  tax  at  a  rate  of  10%  in  Jurisdiction-F .    The  tax administration of Jurisdiction-F took the view that the interest was below the arm's length amount and made an upward adjustment of $5m to the interest.

The  tax  rate  was  lower  than  the  reference  rate  since  the  interest income was assessable to corporation tax at a rate  of  10%.    The adjustment to the  interest  could  not  be  seen  as  an  increase  in  the applicable tax rate.    If the upward adjustment was made according to the terms of the double taxation agreement between Hong Kong and Jurisdiction-F, the result would remain the same.

#### Controlled foreign company rules

25. Some  jurisdictions  have  controlled  foreign  company  (CFC)  rules which  require  resident  companies  to  include  in  their  taxable  income  the taxable profits derived by a controlled company resident in a jurisdiction with low  or  nil  tax  rate.    Even  though  the  interest  is  not  taxed  in  the  lender's jurisdiction,  the  lender's  parent  company  is  required  to  pay  tax  on  such interest under the CFC rules of its own jurisdiction.    Nevertheless, only the applicable tax rate in the lender's jurisdiction would be used to compare with the  reference  rate  for  the  purpose  of  section  16(2)(g)(ii).    The  fact  that  the interest income has been subject to tax at a rate higher than the reference rate in the jurisdiction in which the lender's parent company resides is not relevant since the parent company is not the lender.

#### Risk based enquiry

26. In some specific cases, it might be too costly or impracticable for a corporation carrying on an intra-group financing business in Hong Kong to calculate or ascertain prior to the filing of a profits tax return the tax rate for

each of the interest payments made to non-Hong Kong associated corporations in various jurisdictions given the high frequency of intra-group financing  transactions  and  the  insignificant  sums  involved.    In  these  cases, the Commissioner would consider not to impose any penalty where the failure to  identify  such  interest  payments,  which  fail  to  satisfy  the  prescribed conditions, is neither deliberate nor intentional.

27. In practice, the Commissioner would adopt a robust, pragmatic and risk-based  approach  to  carry  out  examination  of  interest  deduction  claims made under section 16(2)(g).    In general, arm's length loan transactions with interest  payment  less  than  $250,000  for  a  year  might  not  be  scrutinised. However,  when  an  enquiry  is  made,  details  including  the  tax  paid  in  the overseas jurisdiction are expected to be provided.    Where no tax losses are available for set-off or no tax relief is given in respect of the interest in the overseas jurisdiction, the tax rate at which the interest is charged should be equivalent to the tax rate applicable to the lender in that jurisdiction for the taxable year or period.

### Beneficial ownership test

28. Section  16(2)(g)(iii)  has  imposed  the  condition  that  the  lender's right to use and enjoy the interest must not be constrained by a contractual or legal  obligation  to  pass  that  interest  to  any  other  person.    The  condition requires that the lender is the 'beneficial owner' of the interest.    The concept is not to be construed in a narrow technical sense and should be understood in its context and in light of the object and purposes of the legislative provision (e.g. the prevention of passing the interest to another person who is subject to no tax or a low rate of tax).    As a consequence, a conduit company which has very narrow powers that render it, in relation to the interest concerned, a mere fiduciary or administrator acting on account of other interested parties would not be considered as the beneficial owner of the interest.
29. Interest deduction would be denied if the lender is merely an agent, nominee or conduit company acting as a fiduciary or administrator in conduit arrangements, in particular back-to-back structures, assignments, defeasance arrangements,  in  which  the  lender  is  obliged  to  pass  the  interest  to  another person upon receipt.    If the whole or part of the interest payment is passed to

another  person  under  a  contractual  or  legal  obligation,  interest  deduction would be denied in full or proportionately.

**Example 13**

Corporation-HK, an investment holding company, was also carrying on an intra-group financing business in Hong Kong.    It paid interest of $1,000,000 to Corporation-F, its associated corporation in Jurisdiction-F. Corporation-F  was  subject  to corporation tax in Jurisdiction-F at a flat rate of 20%.    Under an arrangement, which was not transacted on an arm's length basis, Corporation-F  was  obligated  to  pass  on  the  interest  income  of $1,000,000  to  another  person  by  way  of  a  deductible  payment  in Jurisdiction-F  (e.g.  interest  payment  or  fee)  that  was  equal  to  or not significantly different from the interest income.

Corporation-F's right to use and enjoy the interest was constrained by  a  contractual  obligation  to  pass  the  same  sum  or  a  sum  not materially  different  in  quantum  to  another  person.    As  such,  the interest  of  $1,000,000  could  not  be  claimed  for  deduction  by Corporation-HK since the condition under section 16(2)(g)(iii) was not satisfied.

30. If the obligation to pass on the interest to a third party arises as a result  of  a  transaction  between  the  lender  and  a  person  other  than  the borrower  dealing  with  each  other  at  arm's  length,  the  interest  can  still  be regarded  as  having  satisfied  the  condition  in  section  16(2)(g)(iii).    For example, the interest received is passed on to a third party banking institution under a security arrangement between the lender and that third party banking institution where the lender has pledged as security receivables and advances made to that third party banking institution.

**Example 14**

For the purpose of its intra-group financing business, Corporation-HK borrowed a loan of $10m from Corporation-F, its associated  corporation  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F,  under  which

interest would be charged at 5% p.a. During Year 1, Corporation-F pledged the aforesaid loan to an independent third party  banker  in  New  York  and  assigned  the  interest  stream  from Corporation-HK  to  the  banker  for  raising  funds  for  its  trading operation.

As  Corporation-F's  legal  obligation  to  pass  interest  to  the  New York  banker  arose  as  a  result  of  an  arm's  length  transaction, Corporation-HK would be entitled to claim deduction of the interest paid  to  Corporation-F  under  section  16(2)(g)  if  other  conditions were also fulfilled.

### Specific anti-avoidance provisions

31. Apart from the above criteria, any interest claimed to be deducted under  section  16(2)(g)  is  further  subject  to  two  specific  anti-avoidance measures.

#### Interest diversion test: section 16(2CA) and (2CB)

32. Deduction  of  interest  under  section  16(2)(g)  will  be  restricted  if there is an arrangement under which interest will be paid, directly or through an  interposed  person,  to  a  related  person  within  the  meaning  of  section 16(2I)(d), who:
- (a) does not need to pay profits tax in Hong Kong or any other similar tax outside Hong Kong; or
- (b) is required to pay profits tax in Hong Kong or a similar tax outside Hong Kong, but no rate at which the related person is  subject  to  such  tax  is  equal  to  or  higher  than  the  Hong Kong reference rate (i.e. 16.5% or 8.25%).

Section 16(2CA) applies where the said arrangement exists at any time during the basis period of the borrower for the year of assessment in respect of which deduction  is  claimed  for  the  interest  on  the  respective  loan.    Similar  to section 16(2B), this section has to be construed together with section 16(2E)(a)

and (b).    As such, the expression 'any sum payable by way of interest on the money borrowed' can refer to interest payable on the second loan advanced by  way  of  sub-participating  in  the  first  loan  borrowed  by  the  borrower. What is more, any payment of interest to a trustee or a corporation controlled by  the  trustee  is  deemed  to  be  a  payment  to  each  of  the  trustee,  the corporation and the beneficiary under the trust.

33. Triggering the application of section 16(2CA) does not necessarily mean that the whole amount of interest incurred on a loan will be disqualified for deduction.    Indeed, section 16(2CB) allows for apportionment of interest expenses in accordance with the following formula:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where:  A means the total number of days during the basis period of the borrower for the year of assessment concerned, at the end  of  each  of  which  the  principal  in  respect  of  the money borrowed or in respect of the relevant part of the money borrowed, as the case may be, is outstanding and the arrangements mentioned in section 16(2CA)(a) are in place;

- B means the total number of days during the basis period of the borrower for the year of assessment concerned, at the end  of  each  of  which  the  principal  in  respect  of  the money borrowed or in respect of the relevant part of the money borrowed, as the case may be, is outstanding; and
- C means the total amount of sums payable by the borrower by  way  of  interest  on  the  money  borrowed  or  on  the relevant part of the money borrowed, as the case may be, that, but for section 16(2A), (2B), (2C) and (2CA), would have been deductible under section 16(1)(a) for the year of assessment concerned.

Therefore, the provision applies to arrangements that cover interest payable on part  of  a  loan.    It  also  allows  apportionment  on  a  time  basis  where  the

arrangem interest is ent is in place for only part of the basis period during which the loan incurred.

**Example 15**

At  the  beginning  of  Year  1,  Corporation-HK  borrowed  a  loan  of $10m from Corporation-F1, its associated corporation resident in Jurisdiction-F1,  at  an  interest  rate  of  5%  p.a.  in  the  ordinary course  of  its  intra-group  financing  business.    After  six  months, $7m  of  the  loan  was  sub-participated  to  Corporation-F2,  an associated  corporation  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F2  which  did  not levy any income tax.    In Year 1, Corporation-HK incurred interest of  $500,000  under  the  loan,  out  of  which  $175,000  received  by Corporation-F1 was paid to Corporation-F2.

Corporation-F2  was  a  related  person  since  Corporation-HK  and Corporation-F2 were connected persons.    The sub-participation of $7m  of  the  loan  to  Corporation-F2  constituted  an  arrangement. Since Jurisdiction-F2 did not levy any income tax on the interest of $175,000 accrued to Corporation-F2, interest disallowed for deduction  under  section  16(2CB)  was:  $175,000  (i.e.  $500,000 × 7/10 × 1/2).

34. combat p Hong  K deductio such as interest receipt, t so, the assessme The  provisions  in  section  16(2CA)  and  (2CB)  are  designed  to rofit  shifting  schemes  involving  disguised  expenses  and  to  protect ong's  tax  base.    Hence,  they  would  apply  to  disallow  an  interest n  even  if  the  interest  is  paid  out  to  a  related  person  in  other  forms management fee or service fee under an arrangement.    In some cases, may be paid out by the non-resident lender in a year subsequent to its hat is, after deduction has already been permitted in Hong Kong.    If interest  deduction  granted  would  be  withdrawn  and  additional nt would be raised under section 60 of the Ordinance.

#### Loss shift ing test: section 16(2CC) and (2CD)

35. deductio Section 16(2CC)  introduces a main  purpose  test for interest n under section 16(2)(g).    If the Commissioner is satisfied that the

main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the borrowing of money by a corporation from its non-Hong Kong associated corporation is to utilise a loss to  avoid,  postpone  or  reduce  any  liability,  whether  of  the  corporation  or another  person,  to  profits  tax  under  the  Ordinance,  no  deduction  is  to  be allowed  in  respect  of  the  interest  payable  on  that  money  borrowed  by  the corporation.    In  section  16(2CD),  the  word  'loss'  is  defined  as  a  loss sustained by a related person within the meaning of section 16(2I)(d)(ii) or (iii) in a trade, profession or business, whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere; and includes any balance of such loss.

36. This  specific  anti-avoidance  provision  aims  at  striking  down  tax avoidance schemes that shift losses, including capital losses, to Hong Kong from overseas.    Whether a company is in a loss situation is a factual matter which can be ascertained by examining the tax assessment or loss statement of the interest recipient. The main purpose test would not create unnecessary inhibitions in genuine intra-group money borrowing and lending transactions.    Not every loan transaction with interest paid to an associated corporation with tax losses will be subject to section 16(2CC).    The crux of the  matter  is  whether  the  main  purpose  or  one  of  the  main  purposes  of  the loan transaction is to avoid profits tax liabilities.
37. From the taxpayers' perspectives, the 'main purpose test' may be regarded as more stringent than the 'sole or dominant purpose test' under the existing  section  61A.    Despite  this,  the  adoption  of  such  test  in  section 16(2CC) reflects the current international practice to use the 'main purpose test' as one of the anti-avoidance measures.    In fact, this test is increasingly found in overseas tax legislation and avoidance of double taxation agreements, including  those  signed  by  Hong  Kong  and  our  tax  treaty  partners  and incorporated  in  the  subsidiary  legislation  of  the  Ordinance.    It  has  been addressed in some English court cases, namely, Marwood Homes Ltd. v IRC, [1999] STC (SCD) 44 and Snell v HMRC, 78 TC 294.    No matter whether the 'main purpose test' or the 'sole or dominant purpose test' is used, all the relevant facts of the case have to be considered before reaching a conclusion under such tests.

**Example 16**

CTC-HK is a regional corporate treasury centre resident in Hong Kong of a multinational group of companies. Holding Corporation-F is the ultimate holding company of the multinational group.    For  the  purpose  of  its  intra-group  financing  business, CTC-HK borrowed a loan of  $25m  from  Holding  Corporation-F. During Year 1, CTC-HK  paid interest of $3m to Holding Corporation-F. Due  to poor business performance,  Holding Corporation-F incurred a loss of $2m from other business operations for that year.

It was unlikely that the main purpose or one of the main purposes of  the  loan  transaction  was  to  utilise  the  current  year  loss  of Holding Corporation-F to avoid profits tax liabilities of CTC-HK or its  associated  corporations operating in Hong Kong.    At the time of borrowing the loan from Holding Corporation-F, it might not be reasonably  foreseeable  that  Holding  Corporation-F  would  incur  a loss in Year 1.    In the circumstances, section 16(2CC) might not be invoked and the interest deduction claimed by CTC-HK could be allowed under section 16(2)(g), provided that the tax rate was not lower than the reference rate.

If,  at  the  time  of  the  loan  transaction,  Holding Corporation-F was already in a loss position (e.g. accumulated losses from back years) or  was  expecting  to  incur  substantial  losses,  the  circumstances  at the  time  of  the  loan  transaction  would  be  carefully  scrutinised  to ascertain whether the main purpose or one of the main purposes of the loan transaction was to utilise the losses of Holding Corporation-F  to  avoid  the  profits  tax  liabilities  of  CTC-HK  or other associated corporations operating in Hong Kong.

**Example 17**

CTC-HK is a regional corporate treasury centre resident in Hong Kong  of  a  multinational  group  of  companies.    CTC-HK  paid interest  of  $2.5m  to  Corporation-F  which  was  a  non-Hong  Kong

associated  corporation.    While  Corporation-F  was  in  an  overall profit position, it was a partner to a partnership, formed between associated corporations, with substantial losses available for set-off against the profits of Corporation-F.

It was likely that the main purpose or one of the main purposes of the  loan  transaction  was  to  utilise  the  losses  of  the  partnership  to avoid profits tax liabilities of CTC-HK or its associated corporations operating in Hong Kong.    At the time of borrowing the  loan  from  Corporation-F, if it  was  reasonably foreseeable that Corporation-F would absorb losses incurred by the partnership, the provisions in section 16(2CC) might be applicable.

### Interaction with other interest deduction rules

38. Section  16(2)(g)  and  the  specific  anti-avoidance  provisions  in section 16(2CA) to (2CD) do not affect the existing interest deduction rules. Section  16(2)(g)  only  creates  an  additional  limb  for  corporations  to  claim interest  deduction  in  respect  of  money  borrowed  from  non-Hong  Kong associated corporations.    For interest on money borrowed from other sources, taxpayers can still rely on other limbs in section 16(2) to claim deduction and the  existing  anti-avoidance  provisions  in  section  16(2A)  to  (2C)  (i.e.  the secured-loan  test  and  the  interest  flow-back  test)  would  continue  to  be applicable where appropriate.

Example 18 For the purpose of its intra-group financing business, CTC-HK, a

QCTC, borrowed three loans and incurred interest as follows:

| Loan   | Lender         | Amount   | Term     | Interest incurred   |
|--------|----------------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| Loan-1 | Local bank     | $10m     | 3 months | $150,000            |
| Loan-2 | Corporation-HK | $5m      | 1 year   | $200,000            |
| Loan-3 | Corporation-F1 | $5m      | 6 months | $100,000            |

Corporation-HK was a Hong Kong associated corporation whereas

Corporation-F1  was  a  non-Hong  Kong  associated  corporation

resident  in  Jurisdiction-F1.    Loan-1  was  not  secured  by  bank deposits.    All  the  three  loans  were  on-lent  to  Corporation-F2,  a non-Hong Kong associated corporation resident in Jurisdiction-F2. In the taxable year in which the interest was earned, Corporation-F1 was required to pay corporation tax in Jurisdiction-F1 at 10% on its profits which included the interest of $100,000 on Loan-3.

CTC-HK  was  a  QCTC  and  the  loan  to  Corporation-F2  was  a qualifying  lending  transaction.    The  reference  rate  should  be 8.25%.    As Loan-1 was borrowed from a financial institution and was  not  secured  by  bank  deposits,  the  interest  of  $150,000  was deductible  under  section  16(2)(d).    For  Loan-2,  the  interest  of $200,000  was  also  deductible  under  section  16(2)(c)  because Corporation-HK  was  chargeable  to  profits  tax  in  Hong  Kong. Regarding Loan-3, the condition in section 16(2)(g)(ii) was satisfied since Corporation-F1 was subject to tax in Jurisdiction-F1 at  a  rate  not  lower  than  the  reference  rate  of  8.25%.    Thus, CTC-HK  could  be  allowed  deduction  of  the  interest  expense  of $100,000 on Loan-3 under section 16(2)(g).

## MONEY LENT TO ASSOCIATED CORPORATIONS

### Codification of case law principles

39. Section 15(1) of the Ordinance sets out the various types of income that are regarded to be trading receipts arising in or derived from Hong Kong from a trade, profession or business carried on in Hong Kong, and hence are chargeable to profits tax.    The newly added section 15(1)(ia) and (la), which relates to intra-group financing business, ensures that the following sums are assessable to profits tax:
- (a) sums received by or accrued to a corporation (other than a financial institution), by way of interest that arises through or from the carrying on in Hong Kong by the corporation of its  intra-group  financing  business,  even  if  the  moneys  in
- respect of which the interest is received or accrues are made available outside Hong Kong;
- (b) sums received by or accrued to a corporation (other than a financial  institution),  by  way  of  gains  or  profits  arising through  or  from  the  carrying  on  in  Hong  Kong  by  the corporation  of  its  intra-group  financing  business  from  the sale or other disposal or on the redemption, on maturity or presentment or otherwise, of a certificate of deposit, bill of exchange or regulatory capital security, even if -
    - (i) the moneys  laid out for the acquisition of the certificate, bill or security were made available outside Hong Kong; or
    - (ii) the  sale,  disposal  or  redemption  is  effected  outside Hong Kong.

### Operation test

40. The provisions in section 15(1)(ia) and (la) make it clear that the 'operation test' applies in the determination of the source of interest income, as well as relevant gains or profits, arising from the carrying on in Hong Kong by a corporation (other than a financial institution) of its intra-group financing business.    The principle of the 'operation test' is that 'one looks to see what the taxpayer has done to earn the profit in question and where he has done it', and it has already been laid down in the court case, CIR v Orion Caribbean Ltd. , [1997] 1 HKLRD 924, which is binding in Hong Kong's courts.
41. The use of the 'operation test' in determining the source of interest income of an intra-group financing business is different from the treatment of interest income in some circumstances where the 'provision of credit test' is used.    Regarding the 'provision of credit test', the source of interest income is  the  place  where  the  funds  from  which  the  interest  income  is  derived  are provided to the borrower.
42. In the Orion case, the Privy Council held that, where the taxpayer

earned its profits  by  borrowing and lending of money, the source of profits should not be solely determined by the place where money was lent.    The proper test to determine the source of the profits was the 'operation test'.    In the case of money borrowing and lending business carried on in Hong Kong, the profits arose from the business transacted in Hong Kong encompassing a broader range of activities such as fund raising, negotiation and approval of loan arrangements, as well as servicing of loans.    The ratio in the Orion case clearly  applies  to  an  intra-group  financing  business  which  consists  of  the borrowing of money from and lending of money to associated corporations.

43. When  tax deduction provisions were introduced for interest expenses under section 16(2)(g), it was also necessary to include a symmetric tax  treatment  for  treating  interest  income  as  trading  receipts.    This  would avoid  giving  the  impression  that  Hong  Kong  is  becoming  a  tax  haven,  and forestall aggressive tax avoidance schemes. The application of the 'operation test' on interest income and relevant gains or profits arising from an intra-group financing business follows the current practice of the Department.    Section 15(1)(ia) and (la) merely codifies this practice and the legal  principle  in  the Orion case  in  respect  of  such  income  arising  from  an intra-group  financing  business.    It  also  aligns  with  the  current  provisions applicable to financial institutions. No new taxation principle was introduced  in  the  2016  Amendment  (No.  2)  Ordinance  and  no  change  has been made to the source principles by section 15(1)(ia) and (la).
44. Under  section  15(1)(ia)  and  (la),  if  a  corporation  (other  than  a financial institution) lends money to a non-Hong Kong associated corporation in the course of its intra-group financing business carried on in Hong Kong, the interest income and relevant gains or profits derived therefrom would be chargeable to profits tax.
45. Sums  are  chargeable  to  profits  tax  only  if  they  arise  through  or from  the  carrying  on  in  Hong  Kong  by  the  corporation  of  its  intra-group financing business.    In other words, 'provision of credit test' would continue to apply to simple inter-company loans not made in the ordinary course of an intra-group financing business.

**Example 19**

Corporation-HK  is  a  trading  company  resident  in  Hong  Kong. For the purpose of funding the acquisition of plant and machinery by Corporation-F, its associated corporation resident in Jurisdiction-F,  Corporation-HK  lent  two  loans  totalling  $20m  to Corporation-F  at  an  interest  rate  of  1.5%  p.a.    The  loans  were made available to Corporation-F through Corporation-HK's bank account in Jurisdiction-F.

As the two inter-company loan transactions did not constitute the carrying on of an intra-group financing business, section 15(1)(ia) was  inapplicable.    Applying  the  'provision  of  credit  test',  the interest income received by Corporation-HK in respect of the two inter-company loans would not be chargeable to profits tax.

## QUALIFYING CORPORATE TREASURY CENTRES

### Qualifying CTC

46. While sections 14C to 14F contain the specific provisions relating to a QCTC, the charging provisions in section 14 for profits tax continue to be applicable.    Thus, a QCTC is chargeable to profits tax under section 14 since it  is  carrying  on  the  business  of  a  corporate  treasury  centre.    That  is,  the QCTC is carrying on an intra-group financing business, is providing corporate treasury service as a business or is entering into corporate treasure transactions as a business.    By virtue of the provisions in section 14D(1), the QCTC  is  entitled  to  have  its  qualifying  profits  charged  at  one-half  of  the corporate profits tax rate.    The half rate concession applies to a QCTC for a year of assessment only if:

- (a) in that year of assessment -
    - (i) the central management and control of the corporation is exercised in Hong Kong ( the central management and control requirement ); and

    - (ii) the  activities  that  produce  its  qualifying  profits  in that  year  are  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong  by  the corporation;  or  arranged  by  the  corporation  to  be carried  out  in  Hong  Kong  ( the  substantial  activity requirement ); and
- (b) the  corporation  has  made  an  election  in  writing,  which  is irrevocable, that the half rate concession applies to it.
47. Under section 14D(2), a corporation is a QCTC if:
- (a) it  is  a  dedicated  CTC  in  section  14D(3)  which  has  carried out in Hong Kong one or more corporate treasury activities (i.e. carrying on an intra-group financing business, providing  a  corporate  treasury  service  or  entering  into  a corporate  treasury  transaction)  and  has  not  carried  out  in Hong  Kong  any  activity  other  than  a  corporate  treasury activity;
- (b) it  is  a  CTC  which  has  satisfied  the  '1-year  safe  harbour' rule or the 'multiple-year safe harbour' rule in section 14E though it has carried out in Hong Kong activities other than a corporate treasury activity; or
- (c) it  is  a  CTC  which  the  Commissioner  has  exercised  his discretion  under  section  14F(1)  to  determine  that  it  is  a QCTC though it satisfies neither of the conditions in (a) and (b) above.

Under  section  14D(9),  a  financial  institution  is  not  eligible  to  be  a  QCTC. Therefore, a financial institution as defined in section 2 would not be entitled to  the  profits  tax  concession  under  section  14D(1)  even  if  it  only  performs corporate treasury activities for its associated corporations.

### Dedicated CTC

48. The  conditions  specified  in  section  14D(3)  are  that,  in  the  basis

period for the year of assessment, the corporation:

- (a) has  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong  one  or  more  corporate treasury activities; and
- (b) has not carried out in Hong Kong any activity other than a corporate treasury activity.

In view of the conditions, only a standalone corporate entity carrying on the business  as  a  corporate  treasury  centre  and  engaging  solely  in  corporate treasury  activities  can  be  a  QCTC  under  section  14D(3).    A  trading  or manufacturing  company  with  a  corporate  treasury  division  carrying  out corporate treasury activities for group companies cannot obtain the profits tax concession unless it satisfies the safe harbour rule provided in section 14E.

49. For the purpose of determining whether a corporation has carried out  any  activity  other  than  a  corporate  treasury  activity,  only  activities  that generate income to the corporation are to be taken into account as explained in  section  14D(4).    That  means  expense  transactions  would  be  excluded. So borrowing money from financial institutions or taking a lease in respect of the business premises for carrying out corporate treasury activities would not preclude a corporation from being a QCTC since the corporation would only incur expenses (e.g. interest or rental expenses) in these transactions.    They do not generate income to the corporation.

### Central management and control

50. The  central  management  and  control  (CMC)  requirement  ensures that  the  executive  officers  and  senior  management  employees  of  the  QCTC exercise  day-to-day  responsibility  for  more  of  the  strategic,  financial  and operational policy decision-making for the QCTC in Hong Kong and conduct more of the  day-to-day  activities  necessary  for  preparing  and  making  those decisions in Hong Kong, than in any other jurisdiction.
51. The  CMC test  is  a  well-established  common  law  rule  adopted  in many jurisdictions, such as Singapore, the United Kingdom and Australia, in determining  the  residence  of  a  company.    The  common  law  rule  was

enunciated by Lord Loreburn in De Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd. v Howe, 5 TC 198 at page 213:

- '… a company resides, for purposes of Income Tax, where its real business is carried on. … I regard that as the true rule; and the real business is carried on where the central management and control actually abides.'
52. The CMC refers to the highest level of control of the business of a company.    Given the statutory requirements in section 14D(5), the CMC of the QCTC must be exercised in Hong Kong which is also the place where the main operations of the corporate treasury activity are to be found.
53. The location of CMC is wholly a question of fact.    Each case must be decided on its own facts.    Factors that are decisive in one case may carry little weight in another.    In general, if the CMC of a company is exercised by the directors in board meetings, the relevant locality is where those meetings are held.
54. The  place  of  board  meetings  may  not  be  conclusive.    It  is significant  only  in  so  far  as  those  meetings  constitute  the  medium  through which  CMC  is  exercised.    In  cases  where  CMC  of  a  company  is  in  fact exercised by an individual (e.g. the board chairman or the managing director), the relevant locality is the place where the controlling individual exercises his power.    As  CMC  is  a  question  of  fact  and  reality,  when  reaching  a conclusion  in  accordance  with  the  case  law  principles,  only  factors  which exist for genuine commercial reasons will be considered.

### Substantial activity requirement

55. The  substantial  activity  requirement  ensures  that  the  corporate treasury transactions or functions are performed in Hong Kong, the corporate treasury  assets  are  used  or  monitored  in  Hong  Kong  and  the  corporate treasury risks are undertaken in Hong Kong.
56. To satisfy the substantial activity requirement, a CTC has to prove that  the  profit-generating  activities  which  produce  its  qualifying  profits  are

carried  out  in  Hong  Kong.    For  instance,  in  the  case  of  an  intra-group financing  business,  activities  like  sourcing  funds  from  financial  institutions and associated corporations, negotiating terms of loans, signing loan agreements, monitoring repayment of principal and interest as well as making and receiving payments must be performed by the CTC in Hong Kong.    The word 'arranged' in section 14D(5)(a)(ii)(B) covers the situation where a CTC arranges a third party such as a banker to carry out some of the profit-generating activities.

57. The substantial activity requirement together with  the  CMC requirement will ensure that any qualifying profits derived from the corporate treasury  operations  of  a  QCTC  are  sourced  from  Hong  Kong  and  hence chargeable to profits tax.

### Irrevocable election

58. Before the half rate concession applies, the QCTC has to make an election.    Such  election  must  be  made  in  writing  (e.g.  in  a  tax  return)  as required by section 14D(5)(b).    Once made, the provision in section 14D(6) makes it irrevocable.    Thus, a QCTC need not make such election for every year of assessment in which it is entitled to the half rate concession.
59. Under section 14D(7)(a), if section 14D(1) no longer applies to a CTC, then the election previously made by the CTC ceases to be effective. In case the CTC is entitled to the half rate concession again, it is required to make a fresh election.

### Corporate treasury activity

60. The term 'corporate treasury activity' is defined in section 14C(1) as follows:
- (a) carrying on an intra-group financing business;
- (b) providing a corporate treasury service; or
- (c) entering into a corporate treasury transaction.

61. The  term  'intra-group  financing  business'  here  has  the  same definition  as  in  section  16(3)  (i.e.  the  business  of  the  borrowing  of  money from and lending of money to associated corporations).    The elaborations in paragraphs 9 and 10 above concerning 'intra-group financing business' are also relevant for the purposes of section 14D.    As such, if the frequency and extent  of  borrowing  of  money  from  and  lending  of  money  to  associated corporations  amount  to  an  intra-group  financing  business,  the  corporation would qualify for the half rate concession in respect of its qualifying profits even though it might be largely funded by equity or bank loans.    Besides, the provisions under section 15(1)(ia) and (la) clarify that the interest income or profits derived therefrom are trading receipts chargeable to Hong Kong profits tax.    The arm's length principle as set out in the Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 46 (Transfer Pricing Guidelines - Methodologies and Related Issues) must be followed by a QCTC when fixing the interest rates for its intra-group financing transactions.    Transfer pricing adjustments may be made if a QCTC charges zero or ultra-low interest rates on its loans lent to associated corporations; or pays unreasonably high interest on loans borrowed from associated corporations.

### Corporate treasury service

62. Section 1(1) of Schedule 17B defines 'corporate treasury service' as  any  of  the  following  services  that  is  provided  by  a  corporation  to  an associated corporation:
- (a) managing  the  cash  and  liquidity  position,  including  cash forecasting  or  pooling,  of  the  associated  corporation  and providing related advice;
- (b) processing  payments  to  the  vendors  or  suppliers  of  the associated corporation;
- (c) managing  the  associated  corporation's  relationships  with financial institutions;
- (d) providing corporate finance advisory service, including -
    - (i) activities supporting the raising of capital, such as by way of debt or equity, by the associated corporation; and
    - (ii) capital budgeting for the associated corporation;
- (e) advising on the management of the investment of the funds of the associated corporation;
- (f) managing  investor  relations  regarding  the  investors  in  the debt or equity instruments issued by the associated corporation;
- (g) providing service in relation to -
    - (i) the provision of guarantees, performance bonds, standby letters of credit or other credit risk instruments to or on behalf of the associated corporation; or
    - (ii) remittances to or on behalf of the associated corporation;
- (h) providing advice or service in relation to the management of interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk, credit risk,  commodity  risk  or  any  other  financial  risk  of  the associated corporation;
- (i) providing  assistance  in  the  merger  or  acquisition  of  a business by the associated corporation;
- (j) providing  advice  or  service  in  relation  to  the  associated corporation's compliance with -
    - (i) accounting standards;
    - (ii) internal treasury policies; or
    - (iii) regulatory requirements in relation to treasury management;

- (k) t providing advice or service in relation to the operations of he treasury management system of the associated corporation;
- (l) providing  business  planning  and  co-ordination,  including economic  or  investment  research  and  analysis,  for  the associated corporation in connection with any of the activities specified in paragraphs (a) to (k) above.

**Example 20**

CTC-HK is  a  QCTC  within  a  multinational  group  of  companies. It provided to its associated corporations the following services:

- (a) providing  advice  in  relation  to  the  management  of  the associated corporation's bank accounts and related documentation;
- (b) providing advisory service to the associated corporation on its  asset-liability  management  and  formulation  of  dividend policy; and
- (c) providing assistance to the associated corporation in relation to its acquisition of another associated corporation's business.

Item (a)  was  related  to  the  management  of  the  cash  and  liquidity position of the associated corporation and therefore was covered by section 1(1)(a) of Schedule 17B.    Item (b) was a normal activity in capital budgeting.    It should fall within section 1(1)(d) of Schedule 17B.    Regarding item (c), the service was related to the acquisition of  a  business  by  CTC-HK's associated corporation.    It should be covered by section 1(1)(i) of Schedule 17B.    In short, all the above services could be treated as corporate treasury services.

### Corporate treasury transaction

65. Section 2(1) of Schedule 17B defines 'corporate treasury transaction'  as  any  of  the  following  transactions  that  is  entered  into  by  a corporation on its own account and related to the business of an associated corporation:
(a) a  transaction  in  relation  to  the  provision  of  guarantees, performance bonds, standby letters of credit or other credit risk instruments in respect of the borrowing of money by the associated corporation;

- (b) a  transaction  investing  the  funds  of  the  corporation  or  the associated  corporation  in  any  of  the  following  financial instruments for managing the cash and liquidity position of the corporation or the associated corporation -
    - (i) deposits;
    - (ii) certificates of deposit;
    - (iii) bonds;
    - (iv) notes;
    - (v) debentures;
    - (vi) money-market funds;
    - (vii) other  financial  instruments  (except  securities  issued by a private company as defined by section 20ACA(2));
- (c) a transaction in respect of any of the following contracts that are entered into for the purpose of hedging interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, commodity risk or any other financial risk of the associated corporation -
    - (i) contracts for difference;
    - (ii) foreign exchange contracts;
    - (iii) forward or futures contracts;
    - (iv) swap contracts;
    - (v) options contracts;
- (d) a factoring or forfaiting transaction.

66. Ordinary meaning in the commercial world should be adopted for the above terms like  'performance bonds', 'contracts for difference', 'foreign exchange contracts', etc.    Reference can also be made to Schedule 16  of  the  Ordinance  for  the  meanings  of  some  of  the  above  mentioned financial instruments.    As to the term 'factoring transaction', it is a financial transaction where receivables are sold to a third party at a discount in return for assumption  of risk. 'Forfaiting' means  purchasing  of a specific receivable  from  a  seller  by  an  agent  called  a  forfaiter.    Lending  money  to financial  institutions  by  way  of  deposits,  certificates  of  deposit  or  other financial instruments for the purpose of liquidity management  of an associated  corporation  is  certainly  a  corporate  treasury  transaction  under section 2(1)(b) of Schedule 17B.

67. Some CTCs may be involved in re-invoicing transactions. Whether these activities are trading transactions or re-invoicing services, they are  not  corporate  treasury  services  or  corporate  treasury  transactions  as defined in Schedule 17B.    The profits derived therefrom are not qualifying profits eligible for the half rate concession.    If such re-invoicing transactions are so voluminous such that the CTC fails to satisfy the safe harbour rule, it would not be qualified as a QCTC and hence could not claim the half rate concession in respect of its qualifying corporate treasury activities.

### Safe harbour rule

68. Section 14E lays down the safe harbour rule, which seeks to allow corporations having  profits and  assets primarily for corporate treasury activities to be entitled to the half rate concession in respect of the qualifying profits.    There are two alternative safe harbours:
- (a) A  corporation  falls  within  the  '1-year  safe  harbour'  in section 14E(2) if, for the year of assessment concerned, the percentages of its corporate treasury profits (CTP percentage) and corporate treasury assets (CTA percentage) are not lower than the prescribed percentages as set out in sections 3 and 4 of Schedule 17B ( i.e. 75%);
- (b) A corporation falls within the 'multiple-year safe harbour' in  section  14E(3)  if,  for  the  year  of  assessment  and  the preceding  one  or  two  years  of  assessment,  the  average percentages  of  its  corporate  treasury  profits  and  corporate treasury assets are not lower than the prescribed percentages as set out in sections 3 and 4 of Schedule 17B (i.e. 75% ).
69. The  CTP  and  CTA  percentages  of  a  corporation  for  a  year  of assessment  are  calculated  in  accordance  with  the  following  formulas  in section 14E(5) and (6):

#### (a) CTP percentage

CTP P

where:  CTP means  the  aggregate  amount  of  the  corporate treasury profits of the corporation in the basis period for the year of assessment; and

- P means the aggregate amount of profits accruing to the corporation from all sources, whether in Hong Kong or not, in the basis period for the year of assessment.

#### (b) CTA percentage

CTA A

where:

CTA

means  the  aggregate  value  of  the  corporate treasury assets of the corporation as at the end of  the  basis  period  for  the  year  of  assessment; and

- A means the aggregate value of all assets, whether in  Hong Kong or not, of the corporation as at the  end  of  the  basis  period  for  the  year  of assessment.

70. The  term  'corporate  treasury  profits'  is  defined  in  section  14C(1). 'Corporate  treasury  profits'  means  any  profits  of  a  corporation  that  are derived from a corporate treasury activity.    In this context, corporate treasury profits will generally be based on the accounting profits shown in the audited statement of income of the CTC, irrespective of the source of the profits.
71. Since a CTC is expected to follow the transfer pricing rules in the Departmental  Interpretation  and  Practice  Notes  No.  46,  it  should  make  an arm's  length  profit  from  its  corporate  treasury  activities.    In  exceptional circumstances,  where  a  CTC  incurs  a  substantial  loss  from  a  corporate treasury activity (e.g. the non-Hong Kong associated corporation has become insolvent  and  the  debt  becomes  bad),  the  Commissioner  would  consider excluding the loss when computing the corporate treasury profits percentage for  the  purpose  of  the  safe  harbour  rule  or  exercising  his  discretion  under section 14F.
72. The term 'corporate treasury asset' means an asset of a corporation used by it to carry out a corporate treasury activity.    For example, corporate treasury assets may include the following:
- (a)        interest-bearing intercompany loans and receivables;
- (b)       cash and cash equivalents;
- (c) investments made out of surplus fund for liquidity management; and
- (d)        contracts for difference, foreign exchange contracts, forward or futures contracts, swap contracts, options contracts for hedging financial risks of associated corporations.

Fixed assets such as business premises and office equipment would also be corporate  treasury  assets  if  they  are  used  to  carry  out  corporate  treasury activities.    The  asset  values  will  be  based  on  the  audited  statement  of position  of  the  CTC,  regardless  of  the  location  of  the  assets.    Generally, intangibles  not  recorded  in  the  statement  of  position  in  accordance  with generally acceptable accounting principles will not be taken into account.

73. Section 14E(9) provides for apportionment of the value of an asset which is used partly for carrying out a corporate treasury activity and partly for  another  purpose.    In  computing  the  aggregate  value  of  the  corporate treasury assets, only the part of the value of the asset that is proportionate to the extent to which the asset is used to carry out a corporate treasury activity is to be taken into account.
74. There  may  be  cases  whereby  a  CTC  also  acts  as  the  holding company for a corporate group.    Where the equity investment in associated corporations is substantial or the dividend income is not insignificant, the safe harbour  rule  may  not  be  satisfied  since  the  equity  investment  in  associated corporations  and  dividend  do  not  fall  within  the  definitions  of  'corporate treasury  asset'  and  'corporate  treasury  profits'  respectively.    As  dividend income is generally not taxable in Hong Kong, the Commissioner is prepared to  exclude  equity  investment  in  associated  corporations  and  dividends  from the  denominators  in  the  above  formulas  for  the  calculation  of  the  CTA  and CTP percentages so that such a CTC may also be regarded as a QCTC under the safe harbour rule.
75. Under  the  multiple-year  safe  harbour  rule  in  section  14E(4),  the 'consecutive' years of track record of a corporation are to be examined.    The average CTP and CTA percentages must be computed based on the financial statements  for  the  subject  year  and  the  preceding  two  years  of  assessment. Where the corporation has carried on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong for less than 2 consecutive years of assessment immediately before the subject year, only the corporation's profits and assets for the subject year and the preceding year of assessment would be taken into account for computing the average CTP and CTA percentages.

Example 21 QCTC-HK claimed the half rate concession in section 14D(1) for

Year 4.    It had the following track record:

| Year   | Business Activity in Hong Kong   |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| Year 1 | Active Business                  |
| Year 2 | Dormant Business                 |
| Year 3 | Active Business                  |
| Year 4 | Active Business                  |

Though QCTC-HK had three years of active business operations in Hong Kong, it was dormant in Year 2, leaving it with just one year prior to the subject year. Therefore,  QCTC-HK  would  be regarded as having two years of track record.    The average CTP and  CTA  percentages  would  be  computed  based  on  the  audited financial statements for Years 3 and 4.

### Commissioner's determination

76. Section 14F allows the Commissioner to exercise his discretion to determine  that  a  corporation  is  a  QCTC  despite  that  it  fails  to  satisfy  the conditions specified in section 14D(3) and the safe harbour rule under section 14E.    Such  a  determination  would  be  made  by  the  Commissioner  under section 14F(3) if he is of the opinion that the conditions specified in section 14D(3), or the safe harbour rule, would, in the ordinary course of business of the corporation, have been satisfied for that year of assessment.
77. When exercising the discretion under section 14F, the Commissioner would look into the totality of facts, in particular, the types of corporate treasury activities  that  the  QCTC would carry out in the ordinary course  of  its  business.    The  Commissioner  may  consider  the  following factors:
- (a) the activities carried out by the corporation;
- (b) the assets and liabilities of the corporation;
- (c) the capacities, roles and responsibilities of the corporation's employees;
- (d) the  capacity,  role  and  responsibility  of  the  corporation within the group;
- (e) the functions and risks undertaken by the corporation; and
- (f) the operational history of the corporation.

### Disqualification from entitlement

78. Section 14D(7)(b) provides that if section 14D(1) does not apply to a corporation for a year of assessment (cessation year), such corporation is not allowed to re-enter the half rate regime for the year of assessment following the  cessation  year.    This  provision  is  to  prevent  abuse  and  protect  fiscal revenue as a corporation may opt in when it derives profits from qualifying CTC operations in order for the concessionary half rate to apply; and then opt out  when  it  suffers  losses  in  a  subsequent  year  of  assessment  in  order  to obtain deduction of losses at full rate.
79. If  a  CTC  merely  incurs  a  tax  loss  from  its  qualifying  CTC operations,  it  would  not  be  disqualified  from  being  entitled  to  the  half  rate concession.    Section  19D(1)  of  the  Ordinance  provides  that  the  amount  of loss incurred by a person chargeable to profits tax for any year of assessment shall be computed in like manner and for such basis period as the assessable profits  for  that  year  of  assessment  would  have  been  computed.    So  if  a QCTC incurs a tax loss for a year of assessment, section 14D(1) still applies and the tax loss can only be set off against its other types of profits at half rate for the purpose of section 19CA of the Ordinance.    Section 14D(7)(b) would not be invoked to deny profits tax concession to the CTC for the subsequent year of assessment.

### Qualifying profits

80. The  assessable  profits  of  a  QCTC  for  a  year  of  assessment  are, subject to certain conditions, chargeable to profits tax at one-half of the rate specified in Schedule 8 to the extent to which those profits are:
- (a) assessable profits derived from  its 'qualifying lending transaction';
- (b) assessable  profits  derived  from  its  'qualifying  corporate treasury service'; or
- (c) assessable  profits  derived  from  its  'qualifying  corporate treasury transaction'.

Thus,  not  all  the  assessable  profits  of  a  QCTC  will  be  taxed  at  half  rate. Under section 14D(1), the half rate concession will only apply to qualifying profits.

81. 'Qualifying lending transaction' is defined in section 14C(1) as a transaction under which a corporation lends money, in the ordinary course of its intra-group financing business, to a non-Hong Kong associated corporation. 'Qualifying  corporate  treasury  service'  is  defined  in  section  14C(3)  as  a corporate  treasury  service  provided  by  a  corporation  to  a  non-Hong  Kong associated corporation. 'Qualifying corporate treasury transaction' is defined in section 14C(4) as a corporate treasury transaction entered into by a corporation  that  is  related  to  the  business  of  a  non-Hong  Kong  associated corporation.    From the definitions, the specific requirements are:
- (a) the loan is made to a non-Hong Kong associated corporation in the ordinary course of the intra-group financing business;
- (b) the  corporate  treasury  service  is  provided  to  a  non-Hong Kong associated corporation; and
- (c) the corporate treasury transaction is related to the business of a non-Hong Kong associated corporation.

The  above  requirements  and  the  rule  in  section  14D(8)  (see  paragraph  85 below) help to ensure that there would not be half taxation of the sum but full deduction of the expense.

### Non-qualifying profits

82. Even though a corporation satisfies the conditions of a QCTC under section 14D(2), profits derived from the following corporate treasury activities will be taxed under profits tax at full rate:
- (a) intra-group financing transaction under which money is lent to a Hong Kong associated corporation;
- (b) corporate  treasury  service  which  is  provided  to  a  Hong Kong associated corporation;
- (c) corporate treasury transaction that is related to the business of a Hong Kong associated corporation; and
- (d) corporate  treasury  transaction  that  is  not  related  to  the business of an associated corporation.

**Example 22**

CTC-HK  is  a  QCTC  resident  in  Hong  Kong  of  a  multinational group  of  companies.    In  the  course  of  its  business,  CTC-HK entered into two derivative contracts.    The first derivative contract was not related to the business of any associated corporation.    It was  a  proprietary  trade  of  CTC-HK.    The  second  derivative contract was related to the business of an associated corporation carrying on a business in Hong Kong.    That is, the obligation of CTC-HK to make payment to the associated corporation under a back-to-back derivative transaction was matched by a right to the same  amount  on  the  same  date  under  the  second  derivative transaction.    CTC-HK  made  profits  out  of  the  two  derivative contracts.

Since the first derivative contract did not relate to the business of any associated corporation, it was not a corporate treasury transaction as strictly defined under section 2(1) of Schedule 17B. Regarding  the  second  derivative  contract,  it  only  related  to  the business of a Hong Kong associated corporation.    Thus, it was not a qualifying corporate treasury transaction.

83. non-Hong back-to-b corporati by the Q as  a  qual reason, th profits de if  a  QCT If a QCTC enters into a corporate treasury service contract with a Kong associated corporation which in turn enters into a ack service contract on the same terms with a Hong Kong associated on,  the  corporate  treasury  service,  which  is,  in  substance,  provided CTC to a Hong Kong associated corporation, would not be regarded ifying  corporate  treasury  service  under  section  14C(3).    For  this e QCTC is not eligible for the half rate concession in respect of the rived therefrom.    The half rate concession will also not be granted C  provides  corporate  treasury  services  indirectly  to  a  non-Hong

Kong  associated  corporation  through  a  Hong  Kong  associated  corporation. In  the  absence  of  any  contractual  relationship  between  the  QCTC  and  the non-Hong Kong associated corporation, the corporate treasury service cannot be said to have been provided to the non-Hong Kong associated corporation.

84. Where a corporate treasury transaction relates to the business of a Hong  Kong  associated  corporation  and  the  business  of  a  non-Hong  Kong associated corporation, apportionment of the profits derived from the corporate treasury transaction is required.    Only that part of the profits which relates  to  the  business  of  non-Hong  Kong  associated  corporations  can  be taxed at half rate.
85. Section 14D(8) provides that, in computing the qualifying profits of a  corporation  for  the  half  rate  concession,  if  any  sum  payable  to  the corporation by a person in respect of the transaction or service mentioned in section 14D(1)(a), (b) or (c) is deductible under profits tax, the amount of the qualifying profits attributable to that transaction or service is to be deducted by reference to the amount of that sum.    This is to prevent abuses of the half rate concession: the qualifying profits of a QCTC are taxed at half rate while the same sum is deducted in full by a person carrying on business in Hong Kong.    The expression 'by reference to the amount of that sum' means that only the assessable profits attributable to that sum would be deducted from the qualifying profits.

**Example 23**

QCTC  is  a  corporation  resident  in  Hong  Kong  with  corporate treasury  activities  carried  out  or  arranged  to  be  carried  out  in Hong  Kong.    The  profits  of  the  QCTC  for  a  particular  year  of assessment comprised the following items:

$m

$m

| Profits from corporate treasury activities relating to Hong Kong associated corporations                                                                              |    | 20   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|------|
| Qualifying profits - interest derived from bonds issued by a company carrying on business in Hong Kong with funds obtained from non-Hong Kong associated corporations | 5  |      |
| - interest derived from overseas bank deposit placements with funds obtained from non-Hong Kong associated corporations                                               | 8  |      |
| - dividends derived from securities listed in Hong Kong with funds obtained from non-Hong Kong associated corporations                                                | 12 | 25   |
| Total profits                                                                                                                                                         |    | 45   |

Since  the  Hong  Kong  company  would  claim  deduction  of  the interest payable under the bonds issued to the QCTC under profits tax, the interest received of $5 million would be taxed at full rate. The interest derived from overseas bank deposit placements would be taxed at half rate while the dividends would remain exempt from profits tax.

### Associated corporations

86. Since  a  CTC  mainly  conducts  intra-group  transactions  with  its associated corporations, it is necessary to define the term 'associated corporation'  for  this  half  rate  regime.    Under  section  14C(1),  'associated corporation', in relation to a corporation, means:

- (a) another corporation over which the corporation has control;

- (b) another corporation that has control over the corporation; or
- (c) another  corporation  that  is  under  the  control  of  the  same person as is the corporation.
87. Under section 14C(2), a person is regarded as having control over a corporation if the person has the power to secure:
- (a) by  means  of  the  holding  of  shares  or  the  possession  of voting power in or in relation to that or any other corporation; or
- (b) by  virtue of any  powers  conferred  by  the articles of association  or  other  document  regulating  that  or  any  other corporation,

that the affairs of the first-mentioned corporation are conducted in accordance with the wishes of that person.

88. This  definition  of  'associated  corporation'  is  similar  to  those  in other sections of the Ordinance. While  the definition of 'associated corporation' here is wide, CTCs should observe other legal requirements such as  those  under  the  Money  Lenders  Ordinance  (Cap.  163)  and  the  Banking Ordinance  (Cap.  155)  when  carrying  on  an  intra-group  financing  business. Generally, a company without a proper licence can only lend money to or take a loan of money from another company when one is a subsidiary of the other or both are subsidiaries of another company, unless other exemptions apply. In case of doubt, a CTC should seek legal advice.
89. A company is not required to be licensed for Type 4 (advising on securities),  Type  5  (advising  on  futures  contracts),  Type  6  (advising  on corporate finance) or Type 9 (asset management) regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571) if it provides the relevant advice or  services  solely  to  its  wholly  owned  subsidiaries,  its  holding  company which  holds  all  the  issued  shares  of  the  company,  or  other  wholly  owned subsidiaries of that holding company.

## COMMENCEMENT DATE

### Profits tax concession and interest deduction

90. Regarding  the  effective  date,  sums  received  by  or  accrued  to  a QCTC before 1 April 2016 are not to be taken into account for the purposes of the half rate regime.    In other words, sums accrued to a QCTC before 1 April 2016  but  received  after  that  day  would  not  be  eligible  for  the  half  rate concession.    For the interest deduction rule under section 16(2)(g), it applies only to sums payable on or after 1 April 2016.

### Taxation of interest and gains

91. Turning to the provisions under section 15(1)(ia) and (la), they do not apply to sums received or accrued before the commencement date of the 2016 Amendment (No. 2) Ordinance, i.e. 3 June 2016.

The  Commissioner  will  generally  act  in  accordance  with  this Practice  Note  in  granting  profits  tax  concession  to  QCTCs  and  allowing interest  deductions  to  corporations  carrying  on  an  intra-group  financing business.    However, in cases where tax avoidance is involved or the interest deduction  rule  in  section  16(2)(g)  is  abused  to  secure  a  result  which  is  not intended under the 2016 Amendment (No. 2) Ordinance, the Commissioner will consider invoking the general anti-avoidance provisions under section 61 or 61A of the Ordinance as appropriate to counteract the avoidance.

## ADVANCE RULINGS

### Ruling on specific transaction

93. To  secure  certainty,  a  request  in  respect  of  a  specific  transaction

may be made to the Commissioner for a ruling on how the interest deduction rule under section 16(2)(g), the provisions under section 15(1)(ia) and (la) as well as the half rate regime for QCTCs are to apply to the applicant.    The Commissioner requires maximum disclosure for advance ruling applications and a fee needs to be paid.    Please refer to Departmental Interpretation and Practice  Notes  No.  31  on  the  procedures  and  requirements  for  making advance ruling applications.

## EXCHANGE OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNT INFORMATION

### Common Reporting Standard - Active NFE

94. For  the  purposes  of  automatic  exchange  of  financial  account information under Part 8A of the Ordinance, a CTC resident in Hong Kong would  not  be  regarded  as  a  reporting  financial  institution  if  it  does  not function,  or  does  not  hold  itself  out,  as  an  investment  fund  (including  a private  equity  fund,  venture  capital  fund,  leveraged  buyout  fund,  or  any investment vehicle whose purpose is to acquire or fund companies, and then to hold interests in those companies as capital assets for investment purposes) and:
(a) 80% or more of the activities of the CTC consist of holding, in  whole  or  in  part,  the  outstanding  stock  of,  or  providing financing  and  services  to,  one  or  more  subsidiaries  that engage in trades or businesses other than the business of a financial institution (holding or group finance activities); or
(b) if less than 80% of the activities of the CTC consist of the CTC's  holding  or  group  finance  activities,  the  sum  of  the CTC's  holding  or  group  finance  activities  and  the  CTC's other  activities  that  generate  income  other  than  passive income constitute in total 80% or more of the activities of the CTC.
95. Though resident in Hong Kong, a CTC is not a reporting financial institution if it falls within all of the following descriptions:

- (a) the  CTC  is  primarily  engaged  in  financing  and  hedging transactions  with  or  for  its  related  entities  that  are  not financial institutions;
- (b) the group of the related entities mentioned in subparagraph (a)  is  primarily  engaged  in  a  business  other  than  that  of  a financial institution;
- (c) the CTC does not provide financing or hedging services to any entity that is not its related entity.

### Foreign  Account  Tax  Compliance  Act  -  Excepted  nonfinancial  group entities

96. Under the Treasury Regulations of the United States in relation to the  Foreign  Account  Tax  Compliance  Act  (FATCA),  a  financial  institution does  not  include  an  'excepted  nonfinancial  group  entity'.    In  general,  a foreign  entity  that  is  a  member  of  a  nonfinancial  group  is  an  excepted nonfinancial group entity if:

- (a) the entity is not a depository institution or custodial institution (other than for members of its expanded affiliated group);
- (b) the entity is a holding company, treasury center, or captive finance company and substantially all the activities of such entity are to perform one or more of the functions described in paragraph 97 below; and
- (c) the entity does not hold itself out as (and was not formed in connection with or availed of by) an arrangement  or investment  vehicle  that  is  a  private  equity  fund,  venture capital fund, leveraged buyout fund, or any similar investment vehicle established with an investment strategy to  acquire  or  fund  companies  and  to  treat  the  interests  in those companies  as capital assets held for investment purposes.

97. An entity is a treasury center if the primary activity of such entity is to  enter  into  investment,  hedging,  and  financing  transactions  with  or  for members of its expanded affiliated group for purposes of:
- (a) managing the risk of price changes or currency fluctuations with  respect  to  property  that  is  held  or  to  be  held  by  the expanded affiliated group (or any member thereof);
- (b) managing the risk of interest rate changes, price changes, or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made by the expanded affiliated group (or any member thereof);
- (c) managing the risk of interest rate changes, price changes, or currency fluctuations with respect to assets or liabilities to be reflected in financial statements of the expanded affiliated group (or any member thereof);
- (d) managing  the  working  capital  of  the  expanded  affiliated group (or any member thereof) such as by pooling the cash balances  of  affiliates  (including  both  positive  and  deficit cash balances) or by investing or trading in financial assets solely for the account and risk of such entity or any member of its expanded affiliated group; or
- (e) acting  as  a  financing  vehicle  for  the  expanded  affiliated group (or any member thereof).
98. An entity is not a treasury center if any equity or debt interest in the entity  is  held  by  a  person  that  is  not  a  member  of  the  entity's  expanded affiliated group and the redemption or retirement amount or return earned on such interest is determined primarily by reference to:
- (a) the  investment,  hedging,  and  financing  activities  of  the treasury center with  members  outside  of  its  expanded affiliated group; or
- (b) any  member  of  the  group  that  is  an  investment  entity  or passive NFFE.
99. In short, a CTC which is an excepted nonfinancial group entity is not required to report the financial affairs of its associated corporations under FATCA.
