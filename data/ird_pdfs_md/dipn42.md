## INTRODUCTION

### Gains or losses on financial instruments

Hong Kong is a major financial centre in the Asia Pacific region and financial  instruments  are  widely  used  in  Hong  Kong  to  achieve  investment, trading  or  hedging  objectives. Since  financial  instruments  have  become increasingly complex, detailed financial reporting standards have been developed to deal with the related accounting issues.    Against this background, Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standard 9 Financial Instruments (HKFRS 9) has  been  issued,  setting  out  the  requirements  for  recognizing  and  measuring financial  assets,  financial  liabilities  and  some  contracts  to  buy  or  sell  nonfinancial items.

2. The  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  (No.  2)  Ordinance  2019  was enacted to provide for the alignment of tax treatment of financial instruments with their accounting treatment.    Part A of this Departmental Interpretation and Practice Note (DIPN) sets out the Department's views and practices regarding the tax treatment of gains or losses in respect of financial instruments to which HKFRS 9 applies.

### Foreign exchange differences

3. In  Hong  Kong,  business  is  often  transacted  in  foreign  currencies. Gains or losses will result from such transactions due to the fluctuation in the rates of exchange of the foreign currencies.    Hong Kong Accounting Standard 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates provides guidance on the translation method and on determining the functional and presentation currencies. Part B of this DIPN explains the Department's views and practices regarding the tax treatment of foreign exchange differences.

## PART A: TAXATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

## TAXABLE PROFITS

### Principles of commercial accounting

4. Profits tax is charged on every person carrying on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong in respect of his assessable profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong.    The Inland Revenue Ordinance (the Ordinance) itself does not contain a comprehensive definition of the term 'assessable profits'.    In CIR v  Secan  Ltd  &amp;  Another (2000)  3  HKCFAR  411,  the  Court  of  Final Appeal established the principle that the assessable profits or losses of a taxpayer must be  ascertained  in  accordance  with  the  ordinary  principles  of  commercial accounting,  as  modified  to  conform  with  the  Ordinance. Delivering  the unanimous decision of the Court, Lord Millett NPJ said at page 419:
2. 'Both profits and losses therefore must be ascertained in accordance with the ordinary principles of commercial accounting as modified to conform  with  the  Ordinance. Where  the  taxpayer's  financial statements  are  correctly  drawn  in  accordance  with  the  ordinary principles  of  commercial  accounting  and  in  conformity  with  the Ordinance,  no  further  modifications  are  required  or  permitted. Where the taxpayer may properly draw its financial statements on either of two alternative bases, the Commissioner is both entitled and bound  to  ascertain  the  assessable  profits  on  whichever  basis  the taxpayer has chosen to adopt.'

### The two cardinal principles

5. In Nice  Cheer  Investment  Ltd  v  CIR (2013)  16  HKCFAR 813,  the Court of Final Appeal, further elaborated what constitutes taxable profits within the meaning of the Ordinance.    Lord Millett NPJ said at page 825:
- 'There are two cardinal principles of tax law: (i) the word 'profits' connotes actual or realized and not potential or anticipated profits; and (ii) neither profits nor losses may be anticipated.'

He further explained at page 829:

- 'In the present case the subject matter of the tax is 'profit', and the question what constitutes a taxable profit is a question of law.    While the  amount  of  that  profit  must  be  computed  and  ascertained  in accordance with the ordinary principles of commercial accounting, these are always subject to the overriding requirement of conformity, not merely with the express words of the statute, but with the way in which they have been judicially interpreted.'

### Interim measure

6. Following the judgment of the Court of Final Appeal in Nice Cheer , taxable profits, though computed and ascertained in accordance with the ordinary principles  of  commercial  accounting,  will  be  subject  to  the  two  cardinal principles of tax law.
7. Financial  institutions  and  securities  dealers,  which  marked  their financial instruments to market (i.e. fair value accounting), had since requested the Commissioner to accept financial statements prepared on a fair value basis for tax reporting as substantial costs would have been incurred to re-compute their profits on a realization basis. Pending the required legislative amendments  that  permit  the  use  of  fair  value  accounting  as  a  basis  for  tax purposes, profits tax returns with assessable profits computed on a fair value basis  had  been  accepted  by  the  Commissioner  as  an  interim  administrative measure.

### Legislative amendments

8. The Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2019, which became  effective  on  1  March  2019,  aligns  the  tax  treatment  of  financial instruments  with  their  accounting  treatment. The  main  provisions  are  as follows:
- (a) Section 18G provides for the interpretation of terms used.
- (b) Section  18H  provides  for  the  alignment  of  the  treatment  of financial instruments for profits tax purpose with their

accounting treatment if the financial statements are prepared in accordance with a specified financial reporting standard and an election is made.

- (c) Section 18I explains the effect of the alignment of tax treatment and accounting treatment of financial instruments on the other provisions of Part 4 of the Ordinance ( other Part 4 provisions ) in determining whether any profit, gain, loss, income or expense is chargeable to tax or allowable for deduction.    In summary -
    - (i) profits are not limited to realized profits and a change in fair value of a financial instrument is to be brought into account in assessing profits tax in certain circumstances;
    - (ii) the way in which a profit, gain, loss, income or expense is computed is changed in certain circumstances (e.g. interest is computed in some cases at the effective rate instead of the contractual rate); and
    - (iii) apart from the changes described in paragraphs (i) and (ii), sections  18J  and  18L  apply  subject  to  the  other  Part  4 provisions.
- (d) Section 18J provides that the amount of profit, gain, loss, income or expense computed for a financial instrument for profits tax purpose for a period is the amount of profit, gain, loss, income or expense recognized for the instrument for accounting purpose for the period.
- (e) Section  18K  provides  for  special  treatment  of  an  impairment loss.
- (f) Section 18L  provides for special treatment of an equity instrument or financial liability on revenue account, an embedded derivative, a preference share, a loan made or debt security issued otherwise than on an arm's length basis and a hedging instrument.

## ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

### Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards

9. HKFRS 9 has replaced Hong Kong Accounting Standard 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (HKAS 39) and applies to entities for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.    Under HKFRS 9, the classification and measurement of financial assets is dependent on the business model within which the asset is held and the contractual cash flows of the asset. HKFRS 9 also introduces  an  impairment  model  which  is  based  on  expected credit losses.    Appendix 1 gives an overview of HKFRS 9.
10. Apart from HKFRS 9, the following standards are also relevant to financial instruments:
- (a) Hong  Kong Accounting  Standard  32 Financial  Instruments: Presentation (HKAS  32)  which  sets  out  the  principles  for presentation of financial instruments;
- (b) Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standard 7 Financial Instruments:  Disclosures (HKFRS  7)  which  sets  out  the requirements for disclosures of financial instruments;
- (c) Hong  Kong  Financial  Reporting  Standard  13 Fair  Value Measurement (HKFRS  13)  which  provides  guidance  on  the determination of fair value and the term 'fair value' is defined therein; and
- (d) Hong Kong Accounting Standard 21 The Effect of Changes in Foreign  Exchange  Rates (HKAS  21)  which  deals  with  the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
11. The way the profits tax treatment for financial instruments interacts with  the  accounting  rules  stipulated  in  HKAS  32,  HKFRS  7,  HKFRS  9  and HKFRS 13 is also explained in Part A of this DIPN.

### Definitions of terms

12. The  term  'financial  instrument'  is  defined  in  HKAS  32  as  'any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity'.    HKAS 32 also contains definitions of the terms  'financial  asset',  'financial  liability'  and  'equity  instrument'. HKFRS 13 defines 'fair value' to be 'the price that would be received to sell an asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market participants  at  the  measurement  date'.    It  is  not  proposed  to  list  out  all  the relevant  definitions  here.    HKAS  32  should  be  consulted  for  the  detailed definitions that are also applicable to HKFRS 9.

## BASIS FOR PROFITS TAX ASSESSMENT

### Realization basis

13. Taxable profits from financial instruments are ascertained in accordance with ordinary principles of commercial accounting as modified to conform  with  the  other  Part  4  provisions  and  subject  to  the  two  cardinal principles established in the Nice Cheer case.    In effect, only realized profits or losses  will  be  brought  into  account  in  ascertaining  the  taxable  profits  from financial instruments.

### Fair value basis

14. Sections 18G to 18L provide for computing the taxable profits from financial instruments by aligning with their accounting treatment.    In general, where an election is made, both realized and unrealized profits or losses will be brought into account if they are recognized in profit or loss.    In the context of this DIPN, the expression 'fair value basis' refers to the accounting treatments permitted  in  HKFRS  9,  namely  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive income (FVTOCI), at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and at amortized cost.

## ELECTION FOR ASSESSMENT ON FAIR VALUE BASIS

### Conditions for adopting fair value basis for assessment

15. Section 18H(1) provides that the provisions for assessment on the fair value basis apply to a person for a year of assessment only if:
- (a) the person prepares financial statements for the basis period for the  year  in  accordance  with  a  specified  financial  reporting standard; and
- (b) the person  has  elected  in  writing  that the  provisions  for assessment on the fair value basis apply to the person ( election ) and the election has effect for the year.
16. The option to elect for assessment on the fair value basis is available to a person only if the person prepares financial statements in accordance with a specified  financial  reporting  standard.    In  other  words,  if  a  person  does  not adopt a specified financial reporting standard in preparing financial statements or does not make an election, the provisions for assessment on the fair value basis will not apply and assessable profits on financial instruments will be ascertained on the realization basis.
17. Specified financial reporting standard is defined in section 18G(1) to mean:
- (a) HKFRS 9;
- (b) the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standard  9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9); or
- (c) a financial reporting standard adopted by a relevant authority of a jurisdiction other than Hong  Kong, which is, in the Commissioner's opinion, equivalent to IFRS 9.
18. Entities incorporated or established outside Hong Kong and operating in Hong Kong, whether or not through a permanent establishment, can also elect for assessment on the fair value basis if their financial statements are prepared in

accordance with IFRS 9 or a standard equivalent to IFRS 9.    Whether a standard is equivalent to IFRS 9 is a matter of fact and degree.    If the standard is not fully identical to IFRS 9, adjustments have to be made.

### Irrevocable election

19. To  maintain  tax  consistency  and  to  avoid  taxpayer  taking  tax advantage by opting in and out the fair value basis for assessment, the election is  made  irrevocable.    Section  18H(2)  provides  that  a  person  may  make  an election for a year of assessment ( election year ).    The election, once made, is irrevocable  and  has  effect  for  the  election  year  and  all  subsequent  years  of assessment.

### Revocation of election

20. Taking into account that there may be circumstances where a person who has made an election in a previous year of assessment may not be in a position  to  apply  the  fair  value  basis  in  future  years,  an  'escape  clause'  is provided to authorize the Commissioner to allow revocation of the election if the Commissioner is satisfied that the revocation is not driven by a tax avoidance motive and that there are good commercial reasons for doing so.    In particular:
- (a) Section 18H(4) provides that an election may be revoked with the  Commissioner's  approval  and,  on  the  revocation,  the election  ceases  to  have  effect  from  the  year  of  assessment specified by the Commissioner.
- (b) Section  18H(5)  provides  that  the  Commissioner  may,  on  a person's application in writing, approve the revocation of the person's  election  if  the  person  proves  to  the  Commissioner's satisfaction that:
    - (i) there are good commercial reasons for the revocation; and
    - (ii) avoidance of tax is not the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the revocation.
21. In  general,  revocation  of  an  election  should  have  no  retrospective effect.    If  the  revocation  is  approved  by  the  Commissioner,  the  election  will

only  cease  to  have  effect  from  the  year  of  assessment  specified  by  the Commissioner.

22. Whether  there  are  good  commercial  reasons  for  revocation  of  an election is a question of fact and each case should be considered on its own facts and  merits. In  a  business  merger/  acquisition/  disposal/  restructuring,  a company may be taken over by a group of companies that adopts a different tax treatment for financial instruments.    Revocation of election in such a case will be considered as having good commercial reasons.

**Example 1**

Company-HK was a member of Group-HK headquartered in Hong Kong.    Profits  derived  from  financial  instruments  by  companies within  Group-HK  were  reported  and  offered  for  taxation  on  a  fair value basis.    Company-HK closed its accounts on 31 December each year  and  elected  to  apply  the  provisions  for  assessing  profits  from financial instruments on the fair value basis for the year of assessment 2018/19.

On 1 January 2020, Company-HK was taken over by Company-F and became a member of Group-F headquartered in Jurisdiction-F.    As financial instruments of members of Group-F were reported and taxed on a realization basis, Company-HK applied to the Commissioner for revocation  of  the  election  with  effect  from  the  year  of  assessment 2020/21.

Company-HK's reason for revocation of its election was to conform with  Group-F's  tax  reporting  policy.    In  the  absence  of  any  tax avoidance motive, the Commissioner would be ready to accept that there was good commercial reason for the revocation.

23. The  mere  reduction  in  the  amount  of  tax  payable  is  a  factor  for deciding whether there is a tax avoidance motive but it alone is not equivalent to tax  avoidance.    The  Commissioner  will  consider  the  taxpayer's  purpose  of revocation when processing the application of revocation.

## ASSESSMENT ON FAIR VALUE BASIS

### Alignment of tax treatment and accounting treatment

#### Tax relevant amount equals accounting relevant amount

24. Upon  the  election  for  assessment  on  the  fair  value  basis,  the  tax treatment  of  financial  instruments  will  generally  align  with  the  accounting treatment.    Section 18J(1) provides that the tax-relevant amount in respect of a financial  instrument  is  the  accounting-relevant  amount  in  respect  of  the instrument where:
- (a) the tax-relevant amount, in respect of a financial instrument, is the amount of profit, gain, loss, income or expense to be brought into  account  for  computing  the  person's  assessable  profits  in respect  of  the  instrument  for  the  basis  period  for  the  year  of assessment; and
- (b) the accounting-relevant amount,  in respect of a financial instrument, is the amount which is recognized in determining any profit, gain, loss, income or expense of the person in respect of the instrument for the basis period for the year of assessment.
25. In brief, the timing in the recognition of profit, gain, loss, income or expense per HKFRS 9 on financial assets and financial liabilities will normally be  followed  for  profits  tax  purpose.    The  relevant  accounting  treatments  are explained in paragraphs 17 to 21 of Appendix 1.

#### Financial assets measured at amortized cost

26. Gains or losses on disposal will be assessed or deducted for the year in  which  the  financial  assets  are  derecognized.    Foreign  exchange  gains  or losses will be assessed or deducted for the year in which they are recognized in profit or loss.    Interest, discount or premium income from debt instruments will be assessed for the year in which it is recognized in profit or loss through the amortization process by using the effective interest method.    In other words, discount  or  premium  income  will  not  be  deferred  for  assessment  until  the financial instrument is redeemed.

#### Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income

27. Gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income will not be assessed or deducted until the assets are derecognized.    The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income will be assessed or deducted for the year in which it is reclassified from equity to profit or loss upon derecognition.    Foreign exchange gains or losses will be assessed or deducted for the year in which they are recognized in profit or loss.    Interest, discount or premium income from debt instruments will be assessed for the year in which it is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  through  the  amortization  process  by  using  the effective interest method.    Similarly, discount or premium income will not be deferred for assessment until the financial instrument is redeemed.

#### Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss

28. All gains or losses, including fair value changes and related exchange differences,  will  be  assessed  or  deducted  for  the  year  in  which  they  are recognized  in  profit  or  loss,  even  though  they  are  not  realized. Interest, discount or premium income from debt instruments will be assessed for the year in which it is recognized in profit or loss.

#### Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost

29. Gains or losses on disposal will be assessed or deducted for the year in which the financial liabilities are derecognized.    Foreign exchange gains or losses will be assessed or deducted for the year in which they are recognized in profit or loss.    Interest, discount or premium expenses of debt instruments will be allowed for deduction for the year in which they are recognized in profit or loss through the amortization process by using the effective interest method.    In other words, discount expenses will not be fully deductible for the year in which the financial instrument is issued.

#### Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss

30. All gains or losses, including fair value changes and related exchange differences,  will  be  assessed  or  deducted  for  the  year  in  which  they  are recognized  in  profit  or  loss,  even  though  they  are  not  realized. Interest,

discount or premium expenses in respect of debt instruments will be allowed for deduction for the year in which they are recognized in profit or loss.

### Special treatment of impairment loss

#### Expected credit losses

31. HKFRS 9 applies  an  'expected  credit  loss'  model  to  impairment. Credit losses are recognized when expected rather than when incurred.    The model is forward-looking and it is no longer necessary for a trigger event to have occurred before credit losses are recognized.    In general, there are three stages of credit risk of deterioration (three-stages approach).    The relevant accounting rules in relation to impairment are explained in paragraphs 12 to 16 of Appendix 1. Despite the accounting treatments, impairment losses or impairment gains so recognized in profit or loss are not all allowable for deduction or chargeable to tax.

#### Non-credit-impaired financial assets

32. Section  18K(2)  provides  that  any  impairment  loss  recognized  by  a person  in  respect  of  a  financial  instrument  that  is  not  credit-impaired  is  not deductible and any subsequent reversal of any amount of the impairment loss is not chargeable to tax.    Therefore, for Stage 1 and Stage 2 credit risks (i.e. not credit-impaired), any impairment loss recognized in respect of the instrument will not be allowable for deduction.    Equally, any subsequent reversal of the impairment loss (i.e. impairment gain) will not be chargeable to tax.

#### Credit-impaired financial assets

33. For  financial  assets  that  are  at  Stage  3  credit  risks  (i.e.  creditimpaired),  as  explained  in  paragraph  13(c)  of  Appendix  1,  section  18K(3) provides that:
- (a) if the instrument represents a debt that was included as a trading receipt  in  ascertaining  the  person's  assessable  profits  for  the basis period in which the debt arose - the impairment loss is allowable  as  a  deduction  up  to  the  amount  of  the  debt  so included;
- (b) if the instrument represents a debt in respect of money lent, in the ordinary course of the business of lending money in Hong Kong,  by  the  person  who  carries  on  that  business  -  the impairment loss is allowable as a deduction up to the amount of the debt; and
- (c) in any other case - the impairment loss is not deductible.
34. Similar  to  the  deduction  rule  for  bad  debts  and  doubtful  debts  as provided in section 16(1)(d) of the Ordinance, deduction of impairment loss in respect of credit-impaired instruments is restricted to trade debt and money lent in the ordinary course of money lending business in Hong Kong.
35. The application of section 18K(3) is not subject to section 16(1)(d). An impairment loss is allowable for deduction if the instrument in respect of which  the  impairment  loss  is  recognized  satisfies  the  conditions  specified  in section 18K(3)(a) or (b) and is credit-impaired at the end of the year.
36. A trade receivable is credit-impaired, as explained in paragraph 13(c) of Appendix 1, when one or more events that have a detriment impact on the estimated future cash flows of the trade receivable have occurred.    HKFRS 9 allows a person to adopt a simplified approach for making loss allowance for expected credit loss on trade receivables (i.e. expected credit loss is calculated based  on  the  historical  default  rate  and  adjusted  for  future  forward-looking estimates).    In such a case, no assessment has been made on the credit risks of individual  trade  receivables  and  those  trade  receivables  are  not  classified  in accordance with the three-stages approach.    If a trade receivable is considered credit-impaired  and  deduction  of  impairment  loss  is  claimed  under  section 18K(3), evidence has to be produced to prove that the trade receivable is creditimpaired at the end of the year (e.g. reasonable steps have been taken to assess and estimate the impairment of the trade receivable).
37. The  impairment  requirements  under  HKFRS  9  do  not  apply  to financial  assets  measured  at  FVTPL.    In  general,  financial  instruments  (e.g. trading securities) acquired for trading purpose would be measured at FVTPL. Any  expected  credit  loss  would  be  reflected  in  the  fair  value  changes  and recognized  in  profit  or  loss  and  allowed  for  deduction  accordingly  and  no separate  loss  allowance  or  impairment  loss  would  be  made.    If  a  person

classifies a financial instrument as measured at amortized cost or at FVTOCI but claims that it is acquired for trading purpose and the Assessor is satisfied that it is  for  trading  purpose,  adjustment  can  be  made  in  tax  computation  as  if  the financial instrument were measured at FVTPL and any fair value changes will be taxed or allowed accordingly.

38. If  a  deduction  in  respect  of  a  financial  instrument  was  previously allowed  to  a  person  in  respect  of  a  bad  debt  or  doubtful  debt  under  section 16(1)(d) or an impairment loss under section 18K(3), any recovery of an amount of  the  bad  debt  or  doubtful  debt  or  any  reversal  of  the  impairment  loss  (i.e. impairment gain) recognized by the person for a subsequent year of assessment is chargeable to tax for the subsequent year of assessment in which the bad debt or doubtful debt is recovered or the impairment loss is reversed.

#### Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets

39. 'Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets' are those financial assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition (e.g. junk bonds). For such instruments, the purchase price/ fair value at initial recognition includes an expectation for credit losses which was priced into the instrument.    No loss allowance is recognized at initial recognition.    As a result, the loss allowance only consists  of  subsequent  changes  in  lifetime  expected  credit  losses  (ECL) since  initial  recognition.    Any  favourable  changes  in  lifetime  ECL  will  be recognized  as  an  impairment  gain,  even  if  the  lifetime  ECL  is  less  than  the amount  of  ECL  that  was  included  in  the  estimated  cash  flows  on  initial recognition.    In other words, if an impairment gain subsequently recognized in respect of the financial asset is not a reversal of any impairment loss which has been  previously  allowed,  section  18K(4)  would  not  be  applicable.    Section 18K(5), however, stipulates that if the financial asset is held on revenue account, any  impairment  gain  so  recognized  should  be  treated  as  the  person's  trading receipt for the year of assessment in which it is recognized.

**Example 2**

On 1 January 2018, Company-HK purchased a bond with a remaining term of 4 years for $8,000,000.    The nominal amount of the bond was $10,000,000 with coupon payable at 10% per year.    The bond was credit-impaired  at  the  time  of  purchase  and  Company-HK  did  not

expect  to  recover  all  the  contractual  cash  flows.    Company-HK expected to receive coupon  payments  of  $550,000  (instead of $1,000,000)  annually  and  repayment  of  principal  of  $8,700,000 (instead of $10,000,000) at the end of the term.    Company-HK closed its accounts on 31 December each year.

No loss allowance was recognized at initial recognition.    Instead, the ECL was reflected in the fair value of the bond recognized and taken into  account  when  calculating  the  credit-adjusted  effective  interest rate.    The credit-adjusted effective interest rate calculated on initial recognition of the bond was 8.794% (i.e. the rate that discounted the expected  cash  flows  to  the  amortized  cost  at  initial  recognition  of $8,000,000).

The cash flows received for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2019 matched Company-HK's expectation and on 31 December 2019, Company-HK expected that it would recover principal of $9,500,000 at the end of the term.

The amortized cost of the bond as at 31 December 2019, as indicated in the amortization table below, was $8,320,541.

| Year ended 31 December   | Opening balance   | Interest revenue @8.794%   | Interest received   | Closing balance   |
|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
|                          | $                 | $                          | $                   | $                 |
| 2018                     | 8,000,000         | 703,520                    | 550,000             | 8,153,520         |
| 2019                     | 8,153,520         | 717,021                    | 550,000             | 8,320,541         |
| 2020                     | 8,320,541         | 731,708                    | 550,000             | 8,502,249         |
| 2021                     | 8,502,249         | 747,688                    | 550,000             | 8,699,937         |

On 31 December 2019, the present value of the revised expected cash flows (i.e. $550,000 annual interest and $9,500,000 principal at the end of the term) over the remaining term of 2 years, discounted using the  original  credit-adjusted  effective  interest  rate  of  8.794%  was $8,996,491.    Accordingly,  on  31  December  2019,  Company-HK recognized the favourable change in the ECL of $675,950 ($8,996,491 -$8,320,541)  as  impairment  gain. If  the  bond  was  held  on

Company-HK's revenue account, the impairment gain of $675,950 would be treated as Company-HK's trading receipt and chargeable to tax  for  the  year  of  assessment  2019/20.    The  revised  amortization table would be as follows:

| Year ended 31 December   | Opening balance   | Interest revenue @8.794%   | Interest received   | Closing balance   |
|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
|                          | $                 | $                          | $                   | $                 |
| 2020                     | 8,996,491         | 791,151                    | 550,000             | 9,237,642         |
| 2021                     | 9,237,642         | 812,358                    | 550,000             | 9,500,000         |

#### Transfer of credit-impaired loans

40. Section 18K(7) or (8) will apply to a financial institution ( transferor ), which transfers a credit-impaired loan to another person ( transferee ), if all of the following conditions specified in section 18K(6) are satisfied:
-(a) a  financial  institution  (transferor)  transfers  to  another  person (transferee) a credit-impaired loan;
-(b) a loss allowance in respect of the credit-impaired loan is also transferred to the transferee;
-(c) the transfer is not by way of a sale in the ordinary course of the transferor's business; and
-(d) in respect of the loss allowance, a deduction of an amount was previously allowed to the transferor under section 16(1)(d) in respect of a bad debt or doubtful debt or under section 18K(3) in respect of an impairment loss.
41. Where a credit-impaired loan is transferred to the transferee by way of sale, HKFRS 9 requires the transferee to record the purchased credit-impaired loan at the purchase price in its account.    In this situation, there is no transfer of loss allowance and section 18K(7) or (8) will not apply.

**Example 3**

Bank-HK had a credit-impaired loan portfolio of face value of $10 million  in  respect  of  which  a  loss  allowance  of  $3  million  was provided.    Bank-HK transferred the credit-impaired loan portfolio in the ordinary course of its business to Company-HK by way of sale at a price of $7 million.

In accordance with HKFRS 9, Company-HK recognized the purchase price of $7 million as the value of the purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio but not any loss allowance.    Since the loss allowance of $3 million was not transferred to Company-HK, section 18K(7) or (8) will not apply.

42. The question whether section 18K(7) or (8) should apply depends on whether the transferor and transferee are in the business of lending money in Hong Kong on the date of the transfer.
- (a) If both of the transferor and the transferee are in the business of lending money in Hong Kong, by virtue of section 18K(7), the amount of deduction previously allowed to the transferor (i.e. deduction under section 16(1)(d) in respect of a bad debt or  doubtful  debt  or  under  section  18K(3)  in  respect  of  an impairment loss) will be treated as having been allowed to the transferee.    Pursuant to section 18K(4), any recovery of the bad debt or doubtful debt or reversal of the impairment loss subsequently recognized by the transferee will be treated as a trading  receipt  of  the  transferee  for  the  year  in  which  it  is recognized.
- (b) If  the  transferor  or  the  transferee  is,  or  both,  are  not  in  the business of money lending, section 18K(8) provides that the amount of deduction previously allowed to the transferor (i.e. deduction under section 16(1)(d) in respect of a bad debt or doubtful  debt  or  under  section  18K(3)  in  respect  of  an impairment  loss)  will  be  treated  as  the  transferor's  trading receipt accruing on the date of the transfer and chargeable to tax.

43. Section 18K(8) would be invoked only if the loss allowance in respect of the credit-impaired loan is transferred to the transferee together with the loan. In such a case, the loss allowance is not effectively written off by the transferor in the course of recognizing any gain or loss upon the transfer, but is transferred to the transferee only.    Since the loan is no longer held by the transferor (i.e. a financial institution) and the transferee is not in the business of lending money in Hong Kong, deduction under section 18K(3)(b) would no longer apply to any impairment loss in respect of the loan.    Any impairment loss which has been previously allowed to the transferor should therefore be clawed back.

### Other special treatments

#### Equity instruments

44. Equity instruments are  generally  measured  at  FVTPL  because contractual  cash  flows  on  specified  dates  are  not  a  characteristic  of  equity instruments.    Any gain or loss from the changes in fair value of the equity at the end of each accounting period would be recognized in profit or loss and would be chargeable or allowable for the year in which the gain or loss is recognized. However, if an equity instrument is not held for trading, an entity may make an irrevocable election at initial recognition to present subsequent changes in fair value of the equity instrument in other comprehensive income, fair value changes including the related foreign exchange differences would then be recognized in other comprehensive income.    The cumulative gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive  income  would  not  be  'recycled'  to  profit  or  loss,  even  upon disposal of the equity instrument.
45. Section 18L(2) stipulates that if an equity instrument is measured at FVTOCI  but  is  held  on  revenue  account,  all  gain  or  loss  derived  from  the disposal, including the cumulative gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income, is chargeable to tax or allowable as a deduction for the year of disposal.
46. Whether an equity instrument is held on capital or revenue account is a  question  of  law  and  accounting  classification  is  not  decisive. All  the surrounding circumstances have to be considered.    If the equity instrument is held for trading or on revenue account, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income will be chargeable or allowable for

the year of disposal though it is not 'recycled' to profit or loss.    If the equity instrument is not held for trading or on revenue account, the cumulative gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income will not be chargeable to tax or allowable for deduction.

#### Financial liabilities - changes in credit risk

47. For financial liability that is measured at FVTPL, the amount of fair value changes attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability would be presented in other comprehensive income and would not be 'recycled' to profit or  loss  upon  maturity,  sale,  buyback  or  redemption  (each  an event )  of  the financial instrument.
48. Section 18L(3) to (5) stipulates that if such financial liability is held on  revenue  account  of  the  person,  all  gain  or  loss  derived  from  the  event, including the cumulative gain or loss presented in other comprehensive income, is chargeable to tax or allowable as a deduction for the event year.    Therefore, for  financial  liability  measured  at  FVTPL,  if  it  is  on  revenue  account,  the cumulative amount of fair value changes attributable to changes in the issuer's own credit risk (i.e. the amount recognized in other comprehensive income) will be chargeable to tax or allowable as a deduction for the event year.    Other profit, gain,  loss,  income  or  expense  will  be  chargeable  to  tax  or  allowable  as  a deduction for the year in which it is recognized in profit or loss in accordance with section 18J(4).

#### Embedded derivatives - convertible debt security

49. According  to  HKAS  32,  the  issuer  of  a  convertible  debt  security (which provides an option to the holder of the financial instrument to convert it into  a  fixed  number  of  ordinary  shares  of  the  issuer)  is  required  to  split  the convertible debt security into a 'liability component' and an 'equity component' (i.e. the option rights) and present them separately in the statement of financial position.    At initial recognition, the issuer is required to measure the 'liability component' at fair value as if there were no 'equity component', and the 'equity component' will be the difference between the fair value of the convertible debt security as a whole and the fair value of the 'liability component'.

50. The issuer stands in a position no different from that of a debtor of a money debt before the right to convert is exercised.    A convertible debt security would be treated as debt and the interest/ discount/ premium, after deducting the value of the equity component, will be allowed for deduction if the conditions in section 16 are satisfied.    Therefore, section 18L(6) provides that any part of the 'interest, discount, premium and expense' recognized by the person in respect of the convertible debt security that is attributable to the 'equity component' is not deductible.

**Example 4**

Company-HK issued convertible bond at $10,000, redeemable at a premium  of  $1,000. Assuming  the  fair  value  of  the  'liability component' was $9,500 (i.e. the fair value of a similar bond without the option to convert into shares), the 'equity component' would be $500 ($10,000 -$9,500).    During the tenure of the convertible bond, the difference between the redemption price of $11,000 and the fair value of the 'liability component' at initial recognition of $9,500 (i.e. $1,500),  would  be  amortized  to  profit  or  loss  in  accordance  with HKFRS 9.

For  accounting  purpose,  the  imputed  premium  should  be  $1,500. However, for tax purpose, only the actual premium of $1,000 (being the premium on redemption per contractual terms) would be allowable as a deduction.    The remaining $500 are attributable to the 'equity component' and would not be allowed as a deduction.

#### Preference shares

51. Section  18L(7)  provides  that  any  interest,  discount,  premium  or expense recognized by a person in respect of a preference share issued by the person is not deductible.
52. HKAS 32 sets out the principles for presenting financial instruments as liabilities or equity.    Depending on the terms of the instrument, a preference share may be classified as an equity instrument or a financial liability.    Where a preference share is classified as a financial liability, any dividend declared in respect of the preference share would be charged as an interest expense to the

profit or loss.    Despite the accounting treatment, preference shares should be treated for tax purposes as share capital because the relationship between the holders  and  the  company  is  not  that  of  a  debtor  and  creditor.    Dividends declared will not be allowed for deduction as interest expenses and will not be assessed as interest income.

#### Non-arm's length loans

53. Section 18L(9) provides that if a loan is made, or a debt security is issued, otherwise than at arm's length, the amount of profit, gain, loss, income or expense in respect of the loan or debt security that is chargeable to tax, or allowable  as  a  deduction,  is  the  amount  computed  in  accordance  with  the contractual  terms  of  the  loan  or  debt  security.    Section  18L(8)  provides  that section 18L(9) would not affect the operation of sections 50AAF and 50AAK.
54. Under  HKFRS  9,  an  entity  shall,  at  initial  recognition,  measure  a financial asset or  financial  liability  at  its  fair  value  plus  or  minus  transaction costs.    Normally, the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price (i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received). However, if part of the consideration given or received is for something other than  the  financial  instrument,  an  entity  shall  measure  the  fair  value  of  the financial instrument.
55. If a long-term loan or receivable does not carry interest, the fair value of the long-term loan or receivable will be measured as the present value of all future cash receipts discounted using the prevailing market rate of interest for a similar  instrument  with  a  similar  credit  rating.    The  difference  between  the transaction price and the fair value at initial recognition is recognized as a gain or  loss  unless  it  qualifies  for  recognition  as  some  other  type  of  asset.    As  a result,  there  would  be  an  imputed  gain,  loss,  income  or  expense  at  initial recognition  of  the  financial  instrument  and  a  corresponding  imputed  interest income or  expense  for  amortization.    By  virtue  of  section  18L(9),  any  such imputed  profit,  gain,  loss,  income  or  expenses  computed  in  accordance  with HKFRS 9 will not be chargeable to tax or allowable as a deduction.    Instead, any actual profit, gain, loss, income or expenses computed in accordance with the contractual terms will be taxable or deductible.

56. Section 18L(9) normally relates to a non-arm's length loan made or debt  security  issued  to  associated  persons.    The  provisions  would  not  be invoked simply because the loan or the debt security carries no interest or the interest is below market rate.    If a loan is made or a debt security is issued at an off-market interest rate but with good commercial reasons, section 18L(9) should not be of relevance.    In the absence of a tax avoidance purpose, the provisions in section 50AAF would not be invoked to apply to an intra-group interest-free loan of a domestic nature if the no actual tax difference condition or the nonbusiness loan condition in section 50AAJ is satisfied.

#### Hedging instruments

57. Section 18L(10) provides that if a hedging instrument is designated, under a hedging arrangement made in good faith, for the purpose of hedging against any risk associated with a hedged item and the hedged item is on capital account,  any  amount  of  profit,  gain,  loss,  income  or  expense  recognized  in respect of the hedging instrument must be disregarded.
58. In determining whether there is a hedging arrangement and whether the hedging instrument is really a hedge against the hedged item, the facts and circumstances of each individual case have to be examined.    In general, if the hedging  relationship  qualifies  for  hedge  accounting  under  HKFRS  9  and  is accounted for as such, the Commissioner will accept that there is prima facie evidence that  the  arrangement  is  for  the  purpose  of  hedging  against  any  risk associated with the asset or liability.
59. By virtue of section 18L(10), if the hedged item is of capital in nature, any amount of profit, gain, loss, income or expense recognized by the person would not be taxable or deductible.    If the hedged item is of revenue in nature, no tax adjustment is required and the tax treatment will generally follow the accounting treatment as provided in section 18J.

### Reclassification

60. HKFRS 9 requires that when an entity changes its business mode for managing  financial  assets,  it  shall  reclassify  all  affected  financial  assets prospectively from the reclassification date.    There is no need to restate any previously recognized gains, losses (including impairment gains or losses) or

interest.    The  reclassification  applies  only  to  financial  assets  that  are  debt instruments  since  equity  instruments  must  be  measured  at  FVTPL  and  the election, if any, to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income, is irrevocable.    HKFRS 9 prohibits the reclassification of financial liabilities.

61. For  financial  assets  that  are  of  a  revenue  nature,  the  accounting treatment of gains or losses arising from reclassification will be followed for profits tax purpose.    Gains or losses arising from reclassification will be taxed or allowed accordingly if they are charged to profit or loss.    Where any gain or loss arising from reclassification is charged to other comprehensive income, the amount will not be taxed or allowed.    Instead, the cumulative amount in other comprehensive  income  will  be  taxed  or  allowed  for  the  year  in  which  it  is recognized  in  profit  or  loss  upon  derecognition. Unless  the  entity  could establish a change of intention towards the financial asset upon reclassification, the reclassification alone cannot operate to change the nature of the financial asset.

### Tax adjustment for change of assessment basis

#### From realization basis to fair value basis

62. If  a  person  has  made  an  election,  transitional  tax  adjustments  are required  to  be  made  for  the  election  year.    Pursuant  to  section  18H(3),  the amount of any profit,  gain,  loss,  income  or  expense  which  would  have  been brought into account for computing the person's assessable profits for the basis period for any year of assessment preceding the election year, had the assessable profits been computed on the fair value basis, must be brought into account for computing the person's assessable profits for the election year.    This includes the transitional accounting adjustments made in accordance with the transition provisions of HKFRS 9 when the person first applies the requirements of the standard.    See paragraphs 66 and 67 below.

**Example 5**

On 1 January 2018, Company-HK acquired equity shares issued by another company at $10,000.    The shares were measured at FVTPL. The fair value of the shares was as follows:

| At 1 January 2018   | $10,000   |
|---------------------|-----------|
| At 31 December 2018 | $13,000   |
| At 31 December 2019 | $11,000   |

Company-HK  closed  its  accounts  on  31  December  each  year.    It recognized and measured the shares in accordance with HKFRS 9 and accounted for the shares as follows:

| Account                                                  | Debit                                                    | Credit                                                   |

Company-HK made an election for assessment on the fair value basis for  the  year  of  assessment  2019/20.    Profit/  loss  in  respect  of  the shares would be assessed as follows:

Year of assessment 2018/19

Since Company-HK did not make any election for assessment on the fair value basis, its assessable profits in respect of the shares would be computed on the realization basis.    Therefore, the gain in fair value changes of $3,000 recognized in profit or loss for the year ended 31 December  2018  would  not  be  chargeable  to  tax  for  the  year  of assessment 2018/19.

Year of assessment 2019/20

Company-HK made the election and its assessable profits in respect of  the  shares  would  be  ascertained  on  the  fair  value  basis.    When computing the assessable profits in respect of the shares, apart from bringing  into  account  the  loss  in  fair  value  changes  of  $2,000 recognized in profit or loss for the year ended 31 December 2019, the gain in fair value changes of $3,000 recognized in profit or loss for the year ended 31 December 2018 would also be brought into account as a transitional adjustment in accordance with section 18H(3). Therefore, the profits in respect of the shares assessed to profits tax for the year of assessment 2019/20 would be $1,000 ($3,000 -$2,000).

#### From fair value basis to realization basis

63. An election will cease to have effect under the following circumstances:
(a) Section 18H(4) provides that if, on a person's application, the Commissioner approves the revocation of the person's election, the election ceases to have effect from the year of assessment specified by the Commissioner;
(b) Section  18H(6)  provides  that  if,  after  a  person  has  made  an election,  the  person  ceases  to  prepare,  in  accordance  with  a specified financial reporting standard, financial statements for the basis period for a year of assessment, the election ceases to have effect from the year.
64. Section 18H(7) provides that if an election ceases to have effect from a year of assessment under section 18H(4) or (6) ( cessation year ), the provisions for  assessment  on  the  fair  value  basis  will  not  apply  to  the  person  for  the cessation year and all subsequent years of assessment.    Further, every financial instrument  held  by  the  person  at  the  end  of  the  basis  period  for  the  year  of assessment  immediately  preceding  the  cessation  year  is  taken  to  have  been disposed of and reacquired, or released and reassumed, at its fair value on the first day of the basis period for the cessation year.

65. The effect of section 18H(7) is that any gain or loss from the deemed disposal will be chargeable to tax or allowable as a deduction for the cessation year if the financial instrument is held for trading purpose or on revenue account. However, if the financial instrument is held on capital account, any gain or loss from the deemed disposal will not be taxable or deductible.

**Example 6**

On  1  January  2018,  Company-HK  purchased  $10  million  4% debenture  at  par.    Company-HK  paid  in  cash  and  incurred  no transaction cost.    Interest would be paid annually on 31 December. The debenture would be redeemable at par on 31 December 2021. Company-HK  adopted  HKFRS  9  and  classified  the  debenture  as measured  at  FVTOCI.    The  fair  value  of  the  debenture  was  as follows:

| At 1 January 2018   | $10 million   |
|---------------------|---------------|
| At 31 December 2018 | $12 million   |
| At 1 January 2019   | $12 million   |

Company-HK closed its accounts on 31 December each year.    The journal  entries  in  respect  of  the  debenture  for  the  year  ended  31 December 2018 are as follows:

| Account                                                                                                   | Debit          | Credit   |

| Other comprehensive income                                                                                |                | 2,000    |

Company-HK elected for assessment on the fair value basis for the year  of  assessment  2018/19.    As  the  increase  in  fair  value  of  $2 million was not charged to profit or loss, pursuant to section 18J(1), the  sum  would  not  be  chargeable  to  profits  tax  for  the  year  of assessment  2018/19.    Only  interest  income  of  $400,000  would  be chargeable to tax for the year of assessment 2018/19.

If  Company-HK  applied  subsequently  to  revoke  the  election  with effect from the year of assessment 2019/20 and the application was approved by the Commissioner, the debenture would be taken to have been disposed of at its fair value of $12 million on 1 January 2019 pursuant  to  section  18H(7)(b).    If  the  debenture  was  acquired  for trading purpose, the gain on disposal of the debenture of $2 million ($12 million -$10 million), which was previously recognized in other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2018, would be  chargeable  to  tax  for  the  year  of  assessment  2019/20.    The debenture would be taken to have been reacquired by Company-HK on 1 January 2019 at $12 million.

### Transitional accounting adjustments

66. HKFRS  9  prescribes  the  transitional  accounting  adjustments  for financial assets or financial liabilities when an entity first adopts the standard. In short, the financial assets and financial liabilities have to be reclassified and their carrying amounts have to be re-measured.    Any difference between the previous carrying amounts and the re-measured amounts should be accounted for by adjusting the opening balance of retained earnings or other component of equity, as appropriate.
67. The Commissioner takes the view that an adjustment for the financial asset  or  financial  liability  of  a  revenue  nature  should  be  treated  as  a  taxable receipt for an increase in retained profits or a deductible expense for a decrease in retained profits for the year of assessment in which the adjustment is made if an election for assessment on the fair value basis is made for that year.    This view is supported by the case of Pearse v Woodall-Duckhall Ltd [1978] 51 TC 271.    In that case, a taxpayer changed the basis of valuing its work-in-progress in  1969  and  included  the  surplus  on  revaluation  in  the  profit  and  loss appropriation account.    Templeman J held that the 'anticipated profit for work

carried out prior to 1969 falls to be taxed in the year 1969 when it is first revealed and first brought into account'.    In any event, section 18H(3) should now have provided another legal basis for taxing the adjustment.

**Example 7**

Company-HK  is  a  money  lender.    Prior  to  1  January  2018,  it recorded  its  currency  swap  agreements  and  interest  rate  swap agreements in its statement of financial position at a certain value. On 1 January 2018, Company-HK after ascertaining the fair value of the unexpired agreements in accordance with HKFRS 9 recognized a profit of $500,000 which it credited to its retained profits.    CompanyHK closed its accounts on 31 December each year.    It elected for assessment on the fair value basis for the year of assessment 2018/19.

The adjustment  of  $500,000  related  to  financial  assets  on  revenue account  should  be  treated  as  a  taxable  receipt  for  the  year  of assessment  in  which  the  adjustment  was  recognized  (i.e.  year  of assessment 2018/19).

If  no  election  for  assessment  on  the  fair  value  basis  is  made  for  the  year  of assessment in which any adjustment is recognized and later, an election is made for a subsequent year of assessment, such an adjustment will be chargeable to tax or allowable for deduction for the election year.

### Impact on other Part 4 provisions

Regulatory capital securities

68. Section 18I(2) provides that sections 18J, 18K and 18L do not affect the operation of sections 17C and 17D.    For regulatory capital security (RCS), despite the election for assessment on the fair value basis, profits of the issuer and the specified connected person of the issuer of a RCS are to be determined as if fair value accounting were not applicable in relation to the RCS.

**Example 8**

On  1  January  2018,  Bank-HK  issued  at  $10  million  a  RCS  to Company-HK, both were resident and carrying on business in Hong Kong.    Company-HK was a specified connected person of Bank-HK. Company-HK  classified  the  RCS  as  measured  at  FVTPL.    Both Bank-HK and Company-HK closed their accounts on 31 December each year.    The fair value of the RCS at 31 December 2018 was $12 million.    According to HKFRS 9, Company-HK measured the RCS at $12 million and a gain of $2 million was recognized in profit or loss on 31 December 2018.

Company-HK made an election for assessment on the fair value basis for the year of assessment 2018/19.    According to section 18J(1), the accounting gain of $2 million recognized by Company-HK should be brought into account for computing Company-HK's assessable profits for the year of assessment 2018/19.    However, by virtue of sections 18I(2) and 17D(2), the gain of $2 million due to changes in fair value of  the  RCS  should  be  excluded  from  Company-HK's  assessable profits for the year of assessment 2018/19.

#### Interaction with other Part 4 provisions

69. Section 18I(3) provides that sections 18J, 18K and 18L apply despite any other Part 4 provisions to the extent that:
- (a) those other provisions (regardless of how they are expressed) would otherwise limit the profit, gain, loss, income or expense chargeable  to  tax  or  allowable  for  deduction  to  that  which  is realized, received, receivable, accrued, paid, payable or incurred; or
- (b) under  those  other  provisions  (regardless  of  how  they  are expressed),  any  profit,  gain,  loss,  income  or  expense  would otherwise be computed in a way different from that provided for in any of sections 18J, 18K and 18L (whether or not by having the profit, gain, loss, income or expense wholly or partly brought into account for a different year of assessment).

70. Further,  section  18I(4)  provides  that  sections  18J  and  18L  apply subject to the other Part 4 provisions, except as provided for in section 18I(3).
71. Section 18I(3) and (4) sets out the interaction of the provisions for assessment on the fair value basis with the other Part 4 provisions.    The other Part 4 provisions include, for example:
- (a) the  rules  that  profits/  losses  which  are  offshore  or  capital  in nature are not chargeable to tax or allowable for deduction;
- (b) the deeming provisions and deduction rules.

In general, the application of the provisions in sections 18I to 18L relating to profits  tax  assessment  on  the  fair  value  basis  are  subject  to  the  other  Part  4 provisions  (i.e.  the  source  principle  and  the  distinction  between  capital  and revenue remain intact).    Further, all the deeming provisions and deduction rules provided  in  the  other  Part  4  provisions  will  continue  to  be  applicable. Appendix 2 relates to assessing practice concerning: locality of profits; capital/ revenue nature of income; capital/ revenue nature of expenditure; legal form and economic substance; hedge accounting and embedded derivatives.

72. Subject to the other Part 4 provisions, the fair value basis for profits tax assessment relates to: the timing of assessment; and the method of allocating income and expenses (i.e. assessable profits are not limited to realized profits and the way in which a profit, gain, loss, income or expense is computed may deviate from the contractual terms).    In other words, profit, gain or loss may be taxable or deductible even though the financial instrument has not been disposed of; and income or expense may be taxable or deductible even though it has not been accrued or incurred.

## TAX AVOIDANCE ARRANGEMENTS

### Section 61A

73. When tackling transactions to avoid tax, the Assistant Commissioner is  prepared  to  invoke  the  powers  in  section  61A  to  recharacterize  a  financial transaction, including reclassification of the nature of the financial instrument

and the nature of the income or expense, so as to counteract tax benefits obtained by the relevant person or persons who entered into or carried out the financial transaction  for  the  sole  or  dominant  purpose  of  obtaining  such  tax  benefits. Though there are differences in tax legislations, useful reference can be found in judgments of other common law jurisdictions.

### Relevant tax cases

74. In Alesco New Zealand Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue [2013] 2  NZLR  175,  non-interest  bearing  optional  convertible  notes  were  issued  to Alesco Corporation, the parent company in Australia, and the difference between the present value of the debt component and the redemption amount was claimed for deduction as interest.    The questions were: whether Alesco New Zealand suffered  an  economic  cost  commensurate  with  its  claimed  deductions;  and whether  the  deductions  for  expenditure  incurred  fell  outside  the  legislature's contemplation if Alesco New Zealand did not incur an economic cost.    It was held  that  Alesco  New  Zealand  did  not  actually  pay  interest  but  obtained  a reduction in tax liability as if it had.    Alesco New Zealand failed to prove that its  use  of  the  financial  arrangement  to  claim  deductions  were  within  the legislature's contemplation.

75. In Fidex Ltd v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2016] STC 1920, it  was  held that a loan relationship debit arising in respect of a tax avoidance scheme  was  wholly  attributable  to  an  unallowable  purpose.    Fidex,  a  BNP Paribas  group  company,  issued  to  Swiss  Re  four  classes  of  preference  share. The terms of each preference share matched those of four bonds held by Fidex and entitled Swiss Re to receive 95% of the cash flows from each bond.    Fidex then changed its accounting policy from UK GAAP to IFRS.    The effect was that the 2004 UK GAAP accounts recognized both the preference shares and the bonds but the 2005 IFRS accounts recognized neither the preference shares nor 95% of the bonds.    The IFRS treatment reflected the economic effect of the arrangement  that  Fidex  had  disposed  of  95%  of  the  bonds. The  loan relationship rules at the time provided that if a change in accounting policy from one period to the next created a difference in the accounting value of a loan relationship asset then a corresponding debit or credit had to be brought into account in the later period.    Fidex claimed such a debit in the sum of €84 million which, if allowable for tax purposes, would have been available for group relief throughout the BNP Paribas group of companies.

## EFFECTIVE DATE

76. The aforementioned assessing practices will apply in relation to a year of assessment for which the basis period begins on or after 1 January 2018.

## PART B: TAXATION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE DIFFERENCES

## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

### Foreign currencies

77. Payments in foreign currencies may be made or received as a result of transactions carried out.    Though circumstances may vary considerably, foreign currencies received may be converted into Hong Kong dollars immediately or after  a  lapse  of  time,  or  the  foreign  currency  may  be  kept  in  an  account maintained in a financial institution.    At the same time, transactions carried out or  assets  or  liabilities  held  may  be  denominated  in  foreign  currencies.    In preparing  the  annual  financial  statements,  translation  of  the  foreign  currency transactions becomes necessary.

### Accounting treatment

78. HKAS 21 deals with the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates with effect from 1 January 2005.    The standard, however, does not apply for those derivative transactions and balances which are within the scope of HKFRS 9 and does not apply to hedge accounting for foreign currency items, including the hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation.
79. In accordance with HKAS 21, a foreign currency transaction is to be recorded  on  initial  recognition  in  the  functional  currency,  by  applying  to  the foreign currency amount the spot exchange rate between the functional currency and  the  foreign  currency  at  the  date  of  the  transaction.    At  the  end  of  each reporting period, foreign currency monetary items shall be translated using the closing rate; non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency shall be translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction; and non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency shall be translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.
80. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements will normally be recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.

81. When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in other comprehensive income, any exchange component of that gain or loss shall be recognized in other comprehensive income.    Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in profit or loss, any exchange component of that gain or loss shall be recognized in profit or loss.
82. Monetary item is defined in HKAS 21 as 'units of currency held and assets and liabilities to be received or paid in a fixed or determinable number of units of currency'.    The essential feature of a monetary item is a right to receive (or an obligation to deliver) a fixed or determinable number of units of currency (e.g. pensions and other employee benefits to be paid in cash, provisions that are to  be  settled  in  cash  and  cash  dividends  that  are  recognized  as  a  liability). Similarly, a contract to receive (or deliver) a variable number of the entity's own equity instruments or a variable amount of assets in which the fair value to be received  (or  delivered)  equals  a  fixed  or  determinable  number  of  units  of currency  is  a  monetary  item.    Conversely,  the  essential  feature  of  a  nonmonetary item is the absence of a right to receive (or an obligation to deliver) a fixed or determinable number of units of currency (e.g. prepaid rent, goodwill, intangible assets, inventories, property, plant and equipment and provisions that are to be settled by the delivery of a non-monetary asset).
83. According  to  HKFRS  9,  the  requirements  under  HKAS  21  will generally apply to financial assets and financial liabilities that are monetary items in  accordance  with  HKAS  21.    In  particular,  a  financial  asset  measured  at FVTOCI is treated as a monetary item.    An exception is an investment in equity instrument for which an irrevocable election at initial  recognition  is  made  to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income.    Such an investment is not a monetary item and any foreign exchange gains or losses shall be recognized in other comprehensive income.

### Relevant tax cases

84. While  HKAS  21  has  laid  down  the  factors  for  determining  the functional  currency  of  an  entity,  the  Commissioner  accepts  that  a  non-Hong Kong  company  may  maintain  its  Hong  Kong  Branch  accounts  in  its  home country  currency.    However,  per  the  judgment  in CIR  v  Malaysian  Airline System Berhad 3 HKTC 775, assessable profits or losses for each year must be expressed in Hong Kong dollar terms.

85. Exchange gains or losses are neither taxable nor allowable if they are of a capital nature.    In CIR v General Garment Manufactory (Hong Kong) Ltd 4 HKTC 532, the exchange loss was found deductible because, notwithstanding the Board's limited analysis, the intention at the time of acquisition of the foreign currency  was  to  dispose  of  it  quickly  for  profit,  not  to  acquire  a  permanent investment.    In CIR v Li &amp; Fung 1 HKTC 1193, Garcia J held in the High Court that although the sums in question originated as trading income the exchange loss  was  not  deductible  because  their  nature  was  altered  to  that  of  capital investment when accumulated and placed on deposits over time.
86. Whether a borrowing is on capital account or revenue account is a question of law to be determined on the facts of each particular case.    A gain or loss  of  fixed  capital  is  an  item  on  capital  account,  while  a  gain  or  loss  of circulating capital is an item on revenue account.    In Avco Financial Services Ltd v FCT [1982] 13 ATR 63, it was held that exchange losses incurred in respect of funds borrowed by a person who carried on business of borrowing and lending money or dealing in foreign exchange were inherently on revenue account unless the funds were used to strengthen that person's profit-making capital base.    In the case of an ordinary trading company, loans are on revenue account if they are temporarily fluctuating and incurred in meeting the ordinary running expenses of the business.    In CIR v Chinachem Finance Co Ltd 3 HKTC 529, it was held at the High Court that in deciding whether a loss arising from borrowing was made on capital or revenue account, regard must be made to the length and other terms of borrowing and to the nature of the person's trade.    In Beauchamp v F W Woolworth plc [1989] STC 510, Lord Templeman decided that the borrowing of a definite sum for a period of five years was on capital account.    The case is important as it explored the borderline between capital and revenue borrowing which  is  relevant  to  determining  the  treatment  of  exchange  gains  and  losses arising on such loans.    For such traders, where borrowing is on capital account, exchange gains are not taxable and exchange losses are not relievable.    The case established  broad  principles  to  be  used  in  deciding  whether  borrowing  is  on capital or revenue account.
87. In Overseas Containers (Finance) Ltd v Stoker [1989] STC 364, it was held  that  the  exchange  losses  were  not  deductible  because  the  transactions undertaken solely for fiscal purposes (i.e. to get a tax advantage) were not trading transactions, even if the outward characteristics of trading were present.

88. Exchange gains or losses arising in or derived outside Hong Kong are neither  taxable  nor  allowable.    Normally,  exchange  differences  arising  from capital investment in a 'foreign operation' as defined in HKAS 21 should not have any effect on the assessable profits.

### Unrealized exchange differences

89. In the case where the exchange differences are in relation to financial instruments which are within the scope of HKFRS 9 and an election is made for assessment on the fair value basis in accordance with sections 18G to 18L, any foreign exchange gains or losses recognized in profit or loss, whether realized or unrealized, would be assessed or allowed accordingly.
90. For  other  cases,  taxpayers  may  exclude  any  unrealized  foreign exchange  gains  or  losses  in  the  tax  computation  and  bring  them  back  for assessment  or  deduction  when  they  become  realized  in  subsequent  years. However, consistency should be observed.

**Example 9**

Company-HK was carrying on an import and export business in Hong Kong.    It made up its accounts to 31 December each year and elected for assessment on the fair value basis.    On 31 October 2018, it sold goods at a price of €10,000 to a customer in Germany.    The exchange rate at the time of sale was €1 = $9.    A receivable of $90,000 showed up  in  the  accounts.    Assuming  that  as  at  31  December  2018,  the exchange rate was €1 = $10, the journal entries at year end would be:

| Account                      | Debit   | Credit   |
|------------------------------|---------|----------|
|                              | $       | $        |
| Receivable                   | 10,000  |          |
| Profit &loss - exchange gain |         | 10,000   |

The exchange gain of $10,000 would be assessable profit of the year of assessment 2018/19.

### Overview of HKFRS 9

#### Classification of financial assets

1. Unlike Hong Kong Accounting Standard 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (HKAS 39) which prescribed four different rulebased classification and measurement criteria and approaches for financial assets (i.e.  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivable, and available-for-sale financial assets), Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standard 9 Financial Instruments (HKFRS 9) adopts a single principle-based approach for all types of financial assets based on the business  model  within  which  they  are  held  and  their  contractual  cash  flow characteristics.    Under  HKFRS  9,  an  entity  shall  classify  financial  assets  as subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) on the basis of both:
- (a) the entity's business model for managing the financial assets; and
- (b) the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets.
2. The classification of financial assets in HKFRS 9 can be summarized as follows:
- (a) a financial asset shall be measured at amortized cost if:
    - (i) the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective  is  to  hold  financial  assets  in  order  to  collect contractual cash flow; and
    - (ii) the  contractual  terms  of  the  financial  asset  give  rise  on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding;
- (b) a financial asset shall be measured at FVTOCI if:
    - (i) the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
    - (ii) the  contractual  terms  of  the  financial  asset  give  rise  on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding;
- (c) a  financial  asset  shall  be  measured  at  FVTPL  unless  it  is measured at amortized cost or at FVTOCI.
3. Equity in struments are  generally  measured  at  FVTPL  because contractual  cash  flows  on  specified  dates  are  not  a  characteristic  of  equity instruments.    However, if an investment in equity instrument is neither held for trading  nor  contingent  consideration  recognized  by  an  acquirer  in  a  business combination, an entity may make an irrevocable election at initial recognition to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income (i.e. at FVTOCI).
4. Despite paragraphs 2(a) and (b), an entity may, at initial recognition, irrevocably  designate  a  financial  asset  as  measured  at  FVTPL  if  doing  so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch.

#### Classification of financial liabilities

5. HKFRS 9 essentially does not change the approach to classification and  measurement  for  financial  liabilities. All  financial  liabilities  shall  be subsequently measured at amortized cost except for certain financial liabilities which are measured at FVTPL.    A financial liability is classified as measured at  FVTPL if it is held for trading or it is designated as measured at FVTPL. Derivatives that are liabilities shall be subsequently measured at FVTPL.
6. At initial recognition, a financial liability may  be designated irrevocably as measured at FVTPL: when the entire hybrid contract is permitted to  be  designated  as  measured  at  FVTPL;  or  when  doing  so  results  in  more relevant  information  because  either  it  eliminates  or  significantly  reduces  an accounting mismatch or a group of financial liabilities or financial assets and financial liabilities is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.

#### Recognition and Measurement of financial instruments

7. Under  HKFRS  9,  an  entity  shall  recognize  a  financial  asset  or  a financial  liability  in  its  statement  of  financial  position  only  when  the  entity becomes  party  to  the  contractual  provisions  of  the  instrument. At  initial recognition, the entity shall measure the financial asset or financial liability at its fair value.    In the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability should be added to or deducted from the fair value.    In the case of trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component,  the  entity  shall  at  initial  recognition  measure  them  at  their transaction price.
8. As  the  classifications  suggest,  financial  assets  are  subsequently measured, after initial recognition, at
- (a) amortized cost using the effective interest method;
- (b) fair value through other comprehensive income; or
- (c) fair value through profit or loss.

Further, an entity shall apply the impairment requirements to financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and at FVTOCI.    Financial assets designated as hedged items are subject to the hedge accounting requirements.

9. After initial recognition, all financial liabilities shall be measured at amortized  cost  (using  the  effective  interest  method)  except  for  financial liabilities at FVTPL (e.g. derivatives), which shall be subsequently measured at fair value.    Financial liabilities designated as hedged items are subject to the hedge accounting requirements.

#### Effective interest method

10. 'Effective interest method' is used in the calculation of amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and in the allocation and recognition of interest revenue or interest expense in profit or loss over the relevant period by applying the 'effective interest rate'.

11. The  'effective  interest  rate'  is  the  rate  that  exactly  discounts  the estimated  future  cash  payments  or  receipts  through  the  expected  life  of  the financial instrument.    The practical effect is that interest expenses, costs of issue and income (including interest, premium and discount) are spread over the term of the financial instrument, which may cover more than one accounting period.

#### Impairment

12. HKFRS 9 applies  an  'expected  credit  loss'  model  to  impairment. Credit losses are recognized when expected rather than when incurred.    The new model is forward-looking and it is no longer necessary for a trigger event to have  occurred  before  credit  losses  are  recognized. A  loss  allowance  for expected  credit  losses  (ECL)  shall  be  recognized  on  a  financial  asset  that  is measured at amortized cost or at FVTOCI (except equity instrument), a lease receivable,  a  contract  asset  or  a  loan  commitment  and  a  financial  guarantee contract to which the impairment requirements apply.
13. At each reporting date, an entity shall assess the credit risk (i.e. the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation) on the financial instrument and recognize a loss allowance for ECL.    Under the general approach to impairment, there are three stages of credit risk deterioration.    At each reporting date, an entity shall assess which stage a financial instrument falls into.    The stage of credit risk deterioration determines the relevant impairment requirements and the basis of interest recognition.

##### (a) Stage 1 - 12-month ECL

The  credit  risk  on  the  financial  instrument  has  not  increased significantly since initial recognition - the loss allowance for the financial instrument shall be measured at an amount equal to 12month ECL.    Interest revenue shall be calculated on the gross carrying amount of the financial asset (before credit losses are taken into account).

An  entity  may  assume  that  the  credit  risk  on  a  financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low risk at the reporting date.

##### (b) Stage 2 - Lifetime ECL

The  credit  risk  on  the  financial  instrument  has  increased significantly since initial recognition - the loss allowance for the financial instrument shall be measured at an amount equal to the lifetime ECL.    Interest revenue shall remain to be calculated on the gross carrying amount of the financial asset.

Objective evidence for impairment may not be available at this stage.    There is a rebuttable presumption that the credit risk on a  financial  instrument  has  increased  significantly  since  initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.

##### (c) Stage 3 - Lifetime ECL (Credit-impaired financial asset)

The financial instrument is credit-impaired - the loss allowance for  the  financial  instrument  shall  be  measured  at  an  amount equal to the lifetime ECL.    Interest revenue shall be calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost (after credit losses are taken into account) instead of the gross carrying amount of the financial asset.

A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the  financial  asset  have  occurred.    Evidence  that  a  financial asset  is  credit-impaired  includes  observable  data  about  the following events:

- (i) significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;
- (ii) a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;
- (iii) the lender of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons  relating  to  the  borrower's  financial  difficulty, having  granted  to  the  borrower  a  concession  that  the lender would not otherwise consider;

- (iv) it  is  becoming  probable  that  the  borrower  will  enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation;
- (v) the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties; or
- (vi) the purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.

It  may  not  be  possible  to  identify  a  single  discrete  event -instead, the combined effect of several events may have caused financial assets to become credit-impaired.

14. An impairment loss (or gain), which represents the amount of ECL (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required to be recognized in accordance with HKFRS 9, shall be recognized in profit or loss.
15. HKFRS 9 provides a simplified approach for certain trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivable where an entity shall always measure the loss allowance  at  an  amount  equal  to  lifetime  ECL.    An  entity  may  select  its accounting  policy  for  trade  receivables,  lease  receivables  and  contract  assets independently of each other.
16. For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets (i.e. the financial  assets  are  already  credit-impaired  when  they  are  purchased  or originated), the following approach is taken:
- (a) the  financial  assets  are  initially  measured  at  the  transaction price  without  an  allowance  for  expected  contractual  cash shortfalls that are implicit in the purchase price;
- (b) lifetime credit losses are included in the estimated cash flows for  the  purposes  of  calculating  the  credit-adjusted  effective interest rate;
- (c) interest revenue is calculated on the net carrying amount at the credit-adjusted effective interest rate;
- (d) ECL is discounted using the credit-adjusted effective interest rate determined at initial recognition.
- (e) subsequent  changes  from  the  initial  ECL  are  recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Accordingly, an entity shall only recognize the cumulative changes in lifetime ECL since initial recognition as a loss allowance.    Any favourable changes in lifetime ECL shall be recognized as an impairment gain, even if the lifetime ECL is less than the amount of ECL that was included in the estimated cash flows on initial recognition.

#### Recognition of profit, gain, loss, income or expense

17. For a financial asset or financial liability that is measured at amortized cost (not being part of a hedging relationship), any gain or loss on disposal is recognized  in  profit  or  loss  when  the  financial  asset  or  financial  liability  is derecognized.    Foreign exchange differences and impairment gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss.    Interest, discounts and premiums calculated using the effective interest method are recognized in profit or loss.
18. For an investment in debt instrument that is measured at FVTOCI, fair value changes are recognized in other comprehensive income.    However, the related  foreign  exchange  differences  and  impairment  gains  or  losses  are recognized in profit or loss.    When  the debt  instrument  is  derecognized,  the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified  from  equity  to  profit  or  loss.    Interest,  discounts  and  premiums calculated using the effective interest method are recognized in profit or loss.
19. For an investment in equity instrument that is designated at FVTOCI, fair  value  changes  including  the  related  foreign  exchange  differences  are recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income. Amounts  presented  in  other comprehensive income are never transferred to profit or loss, not even when the equity instrument is derecognized.    However, the cumulative gain or loss may be transferred within equity.

20. For a financial asset or financial liability that is measured at FVTPL, fair  value  changes  including  the  related  foreign  exchange  differences  are recognized in profit or loss (except for the treatment of the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk described in paragraph 21).
21. For a financial liability designated at FVTPL, the amount of fair value changes attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability is presented in other comprehensive income (unless such treatment would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss). Amounts  presented in other comprehensive income shall not be subsequently transferred to profit or loss. However, the cumulative gain or loss may be transferred within equity.    The treatment of the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk is not applicable to loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts that are designated as at FVTPL, all gains and losses on such loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts are recognized in profit or loss.

#### Hedge accounting

22. Hedge  accounting  is  an  exception  to  the  usual  rules  used  for accounting of financial instruments.    An entity may choose to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of HKAS 39 or apply the hedge accounting requirements of HKFRS 9.    Compared with HKAS 39, the hedge accounting model  in  HKFRS  9  allows  greater  flexibility  which  aligns  the  treatment  of financial and non-financial items to also allow the hedging of risk components in  non-financial  items,  provided  the  component  is  separately  identifiable  and reliably measurable.
23. Hedge accounting means designating a hedging instrument, normally a derivative, as an offset to changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item  which  can  be  an  asset,  liability,  firm  commitment,  forecasted  future transaction or net investment in a foreign operation exposed to a risk of change in value or changes in future cash flows.    Only contracts with a party external to the group or individual entity that is being reported on can be designated as hedging instrument.    Hedge accounting matches the offsetting effects of the fair value changes in the hedged item and the hedging instrument.    If the hedging relationship comes to an end, hedge accounting must be discontinued prospectively.

24. There are three types of hedging relationships:
- (a) 'fair value hedge' is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment,  or  a component  of  any  such item, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss;
- (b) 'cash flow hedge' is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with all, or a component of, a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction, and could affect profit or loss;
- (c) 'hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation' is a hedge of the interest in the net assets of that operation.
25. Under HKFRS  9,  a hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting only if all of the following criteria are met:
- (a) the  hedging  relationship  consists  only  of  eligible  hedging instruments and eligible hedged items;
- (b) at the inception there is formal designation and documentation of  the  hedging  relationship  and  the  entity's  risk  management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge;
- (c) the  hedging  relationship  meets  all  of  the  following  hedge effectiveness requirements:
    - (i) there  is  an  economic  relationship  between  the  hedged item and the hedging instrument;
    - (ii) the  effect  of  credit  risk  does  not  dominate  the  value changes that result from that economic relationship; and
    - (iii) the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument  that  the  entity  actually  uses  to  hedge  that quantity of hedged item.

26. In a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument shall be recognized in profit or loss, or in other comprehensive income if the hedging instrument hedges an equity instrument for which an entity has elected to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income.    At the same time, the carrying amount of the hedged item shall be adjusted by the hedging gain or loss which shall be recognized in profit or loss.    However, if the hedged item is an equity instrument for which the entity has elected to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income, those amounts shall remain in other comprehensive income.   When a hedged item is an unrecognized firm commitment,  the  cumulative  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the  hedged  item subsequent  to  its  designation  is  recognized  as  an  asset  or  a  liability  with  a corresponding gain or loss recognized in profit or loss.
27. In  a  cash  flow  hedge,  the  component  of  equity  associated  with  the hedged  item  (i.e.  cash  flow  hedge  reserve)  is  adjusted  to  the  lower  of  the cumulative  gain  or  loss  on  the  hedging  instrument  from  the  inception  of  the hedge  and  the  cumulative  change  in  fair  value  of  the  hedged  item  from  the inception  of  the  hedge. The  portion  of  the  gain  or  loss  on  the  hedging instrument that is an effective hedge shall be recognized in other comprehensive income.    Any  remaining  gain  or  loss  on  the  hedging  instrument  is  hedge ineffectiveness and shall be recognized in profit or loss.    The amount that has been accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve shall be eventually reclassified to profit or loss; or shall be removed and included directly in the initial cost or other carrying amount of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability resulted from a hedged forecast transaction.
28. Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation shall be accounted for in a manner similar to cash flow hedges where the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective hedge shall be recognized in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion shall be recognized in profit or loss.    The amount that has been accumulated in the foreign currency translation  reserve  shall  be  reclassified  from  equity  to  profit  or  loss  on  the disposal of the foreign operation.
29. An entity may enter into an option contract and designate only the change in intrinsic value of the option as the hedging instrument.    HKFRS 9 prescribes the accounting treatment for the time value of the option.    Change in fair  value  of  the  time  value  of  the  option  shall  be  recognized  in  other

comprehensive income to the extent that  it  relates  to  the  hedged  item.    The amount recognized shall be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss or adjusted against the initial cost or other carrying amount of a non-financial asset or a nonfinancial  liability. Similar  treatment  applies  to  the  forward  element  of  a forward contract or the foreign currency basis spread of a financial instrument that is separated and excluded from the other element which has been designated as the hedging instrument.    If an entity uses a credit derivative that is measured at FVTPL to manage the credit risk of all, or a part of, a financial instrument, it may under certain circumstances designate that financial instrument to the extent that it is so managed as measured at FVTPL.

#### Embedded derivatives

30. An  embedded  derivative  is  a  component  of  a  hybrid  contract  that contains  a  non-derivative  host.    Embedded  derivatives  can  be  found  in  a number of financial instruments, including put options in bonds, callable bonds, put options on preference shares etc.
31. From the holder's perspective, the general rule under HKFRS 9 is that if  the  hybrid  contract  contains  a  host  that  is  an  asset  within  the  scope  of  the standard, the entire hybrid contract should be classified and measured as a whole. In the exceptional case that the hybrid contract contains a host that is not an asset within the scope of the standard, an embedded derivative should be separated from the host and accounted for as a derivative if, and only if, the following conditions are satisfied:
- (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host;
- (b) a  separate  instrument  with  the  same  terms  as  the  embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and
- (c) the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.

#### Reclassification

32. In the rare circumstances when an entity changes its business mode for  managing  financial  assets,  it  shall  reclassify  all  affected  financial  assets prospectively from the reclassification date.    There is no need to restate any previously recognized gains, losses (including impairment gains or losses) or interest.    As a matter of fact, only financial assets that are debt instruments can be reclassified since equity instruments are by default measured at FVTPL and the  designation,  if  any,  at  FVTOCI  is  irrevocable. The  entity  shall  not reclassify any financial liabilities.
33. The accounting treatment on the reclassification of financial assets is as follows:
- (a) if  a  financial  asset  is  reclassified  out  of  the  amortized  cost category  into  the  FVTPL  category,  any  gain  or  loss  arising from a difference between the previous amortized cost and the fair value at the reclassification date is recognized in profit or loss;
- (b) if a financial asset is reclassified out of the FVTPL category into the amortized cost category, its fair value at the reclassification date becomes its new gross carrying amount;
- (c) if  a  financial  asset  is  reclassified  out  of  the  amortized  cost category into the FVTOCI category, any gain or loss arising from a difference between the previous amortized cost and the fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income;
- (d) if a financial asset is reclassified out of the FVTOCI category into the amortized cost category, the cumulative gain or loss previously  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  is removed from equity and adjusted against the fair value of the financial asset at the reclassification date;
- (e) if a financial asset is reclassified out of the FVTPL category into the FVTOCI category, the financial asset continues to be measured at fair value;
- (f) if a financial asset is reclassified out of the FVTOCI category into the FVTPL category, the financial asset continues to be measured  at  fair  value  and  the  cumulative  gain  or  loss previously  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  is reclassified from equity to profit or loss at the reclassification date.

### Assessing Practice

#### Locality of profits

1. Pursuant  to  section  14  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  (the Ordinance), only those profits which arise in or are derived from Hong Kong (i.e. sourced  in  Hong  Kong)  are  chargeable  to  profits  tax.    Offshore  profits  are excluded from the charge of profits tax.    The ascertainment of the source of an income is a practical, hard matter of fact.    No simple, single, legal test can be employed. However,  there  is a substantial body  of case law  on  the determination of the locality of profits.    The broad guiding principle is to look at what the taxpayer has done to earn the profit in question and where he has done  it.    The  Department  has  set  out  its  views  on  the  locality  of  profits  in Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 21 (Revised).    The general principle of law in this area is not affected by the accounting practice under Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standard 9 Financial Instruments (HKFRS 9).
2. It should be noted that provisions in section 15(1) deem the following sums as receipts arising in or derived from Hong Kong from a trade, profession or business carried on in Hong Kong:
- (a) section  15(1)(i)  and  (ia) － sums  received  by  or  accrued  to  a financial institution or a corporation, by way of interest which arises through or from the carrying on of its business (in the case of a financial institution) or its intra-group financing business (in the case of a corporation) in Hong Kong, notwithstanding that the moneys in respect of which the interest is received or accrues are made available outside Hong Kong;
- (b) section  15(1)(ib) － sums  received  by  or  accrued  to  a  LAC banking entity (the meaning of which is defined in section 2 of the  Ordinance),  by  way  of  interest  in  respect  of  a  regulatory capital security, that arises through or from the carrying on by the entity of its business in Hong Kong, even if the moneys laid out for the acquisition of the security are made outside Hong Kong;
- (c) section  15(1)(l)  and  (la) － sums  received  by  or  accrued  to  a financial institution or a corporation, by way of gains or profits from the sale, disposal or redemption of certificates of deposit, bills  of  exchange, or regulatory capital securities, which arise through or from the carrying on in Hong Kong by the financial institution of its business or by the corporation of its intra-group financing business, even  if the moneys  laid  out  for the acquisition were made outside Hong Kong; or the sale, disposal or redemption is effected outside Hong Kong; and
- (d) section  15(1)(lb) － sums  received  by  or  accrued  to  a  LAC banking entity,  by  way  of  gains  or  profits  arising  through  or from the carrying on by the entity of its business in Hong Kong, from  the  sale,  disposal  or  redemption  of  a  regulatory  capital security, even if the moneys laid out for the acquisition of the security were made outside Hong Kong; or the sale, disposal or redemption is effected outside Hong Kong.

#### Capital/ Revenue nature of income

3. Profits arising from the sale of capital assets are excluded from the charge of profits tax.    Capital profits or losses, if any, recognized in profit or loss  will  be  excluded  from  the  computation  of  assessable  profits. The accounting treatment, by itself, cannot operate to change the character of an asset from capital  to  revenue and  vice  versa.    Whether  the  asset  is  of  a capital  or revenue  nature  is  a  question  of law and  all  the  surrounding  circumstances, including  the  accounting  treatment,  have  to  be  considered.  Well-established tax-principles  like  the  'badges  of  trade'  will  continue  to  be  applicable.    In deciding whether a financial instrument is a capital or revenue asset, the intention at the time of acquisition of the financial instrument is always relevant.
4. By  definition,  a  financial  asset  or  financial  liability  measured  at FVTPL includes a financial asset or financial liability that is held for trading.    It is  regarded as held for trading if it is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose  of  selling  or  repurchasing;  or  there  is  a  pattern  of  short-term  profittaking.    Typically, unless it is a designated and effective hedging instrument, a derivative will be regarded as held for trading.    Thus, the change in fair value

and the gain or loss on disposal, recognized in profit or loss, are prima facie taxable or deductible as the case may be.

5. Normally,  financial  assets  are  trading  assets  where  the  entity  is  a financial  institution  or  it  carries  on  an  insurance,  money  lending,  securities dealing or finance business because financial assets are often acquired in the course of the business with a view to resale at a profit.    In Punjab Co-operative Bank, Ltd, Amritsar v Income Tax Commissioner, Lahore (1940) AC 1055, the Privy  Council  held  that  a  bank  had  always  to  keep  enough  cash  or  easily realizable  securities  to  meet  any  probable  demand  by  the  depositors  and  the realization of such securities by the bank was a normal step in carrying on the banking business.    In CIR v Sincere Insurance &amp; Investment Co Ltd 1 HKTC 602,  the  disposal  of  leasehold  properties  was  held  to  be  part  of  the  normal business of an insurance company.
6. It should be noted there are specific provisions that apply to particular types  of  financial  instruments.    Section  14A  provides  that  interest  from  and gains or profits from the sale, disposal or redemption on maturity or presentment of  'qualifying  debt  instruments'  are  chargeable  to  tax  at  half  rate  (for  debt instruments issued before 1 April 2018) or are not chargeable to tax (for debt instruments issued on or after 1 April 2018).    Section 15(1)(j), (k), (l), (la) and (lb)  deems  as  chargeable  receipts  gains  or  profits  from  the  sale,  disposal  or redemption  on  maturity  or  presentment  of  'certificates  of  deposit',  'bills  of exchange' and 'regulatory capital security'.    Section 26A excludes interest and profits  derived  from  certain  financial  instruments  from  profits  tax. The taxability of the sums stipulated in aforesaid legislative provisions should not be affected by the accounting practice under HKFRS 9.

#### Capital/ Revenue nature of expenditure

7. For the purpose of ascertaining profits in respect of which a person is chargeable to profits tax, section 17(1)(c) provides that no deduction shall be allowed  in  respect  of  any  expenditure  of  a  capital  nature  or  any  loss  or withdrawal of capital.    Neither HKFRS 9 nor Hong Kong Accounting Standard 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates (HKAS 21) in this respect prescribes  any  rules  for  distinguishing  capital  and  revenue  expenditures. Whether the expenditure is capital or revenue in nature is a question of law.    The accounting treatment will not determine the nature of the expenditure.

8. In  deciding  the  nature  of  an  expenditure,  capital  or  revenue,  it  is necessary to examine the facts and the circumstances.    Where the expenditure is  a  one-off  payment  that  brings  into  existence  an  asset  or  advantage  for  the enduring benefit of the trade, it is likely to be a capital expenditure.    In Sun Newspaper Ltd v FCT [1938] 1 AITR 403, Dixon J observed at page 410 that expenditure was of a capital nature if its purpose was to establish, replace, or enlarge the capital structure of the taxpayer's business.    In contrast, recurrent expenses connected with the process of operating it are generally considered to be revenue in nature.
9. In CIR v Tai On Machinery Works Ltd 1 HKTC 411, McMullin J, after referring to the textbook Spicer and Pegler, held that interest payments on a loan to finance the construction of a building which was a capital asset were nondeductible payments of a capital nature to the extent that the payments were made before the building could be used to produce profits.    In Wharf Properties Ltd  v  CIR 4  HKTC  310,  Lord  Hoffmann  at  the  Privy  Council  said  whether interest payment was of a capital or revenue nature depended on the purpose for which the money was required during the relevant period.    In FCT v Energy Resources of Australia 29 ATR 553, the Australian Federal Court observed that in some circumstances a discount expense incurred by the issuer of a discount note may be loss of a capital nature.

**Example 2.1**

Company-HK was an importer and exporter of household wares.    It had made a forward purchase £1,000,000 that related to the future payment of the purchase price of machinery acquired for use in its business.    The currency forward contract was clearly for the purpose of hedging against the foreign currency risk arising from the purchase of  the  machinery  and  Company-HK  consistently  adopted  a  basis adjustment.

The  nature  of  the  gain  or  loss  arising  from  the  currency  forward contract depended on the nature of the underlying asset (i.e. hedged item).    Thus the gain or loss from the currency forward contract was capital in nature.    It should be taken into account in determining the capital  expenditure  incurred  on  the  provision  of  the  machinery  for depreciation allowances purposes.    Such gain or loss would similarly

be  taken  into  account  for  depreciation  allowances  purposes  if  the company does not 'basis adjust' (i.e. it was simply debited or credited to profit or loss).

**Example 2.2**

Company-HK was a retailer.    It  entered  into  forward  contracts  to hedge against foreign exchange risks in relation to goods purchased from  various  overseas  suppliers,  thus  reducing  fluctuations  in  the costs of its inventory.

Profits  and  losses  from  the  forward  contracts  would  be  taken  into account  as  part  of  the  profits  and  losses  of  the  trade  because  they related closely to the purchase of the inventory.

**Example 2.3**

Company-HK  borrowed  money  at  a  floating  rate  of  interest  for purchase  of  trading  stock  and  entered  into  an  interest  rate  futures contract with a view to protecting itself against rises in interest rates.

Profits and losses relating to the interest rate futures contract would be taken  into  account  as  trading  income  or  expenditure  because  the interest  rate  futures  contract  closely  related  to  money  borrowed  on revenue account for the purchase of trading stock.

10. It should be noted that under a pass-through arrangement whereby an obligation to transfer the cash flows from the financial asset is assumed and the financial  asset  has  been  derecognized,  it  does  not  necessarily  follow  that  the interest payments included in the cash outflows have fulfilled the conditions in section 16(2).

**Example 2.4**

Company-HK1  and  Company-HK2  were  carrying  on  business  in Hong Kong.    They were not connected.    Company-HK1 advanced an interest bearing loan of $100 million to Company-HK2. Company-HK1  funded  its  advances  to  Company-HK2  with  a  non-

recourse loan from Company-F, which was a company operating in Jurisdiction-F.    Company-HK1 did not earn an interest spread and was only required to make payments of interest and repayments of principal  out  of  the  cash  flows  it  received  from  Company-HK2. There was no assignment of the loan or of the cash flows by CompanyHK1.    Under the above arrangement, Company-HK1 did not have any risk or reward. Thus  under  HKFRS  9  Company-HK1 derecognized  from  its  accounts  the  advance  to  Company-HK2  and the non-recourse loan from Company-F.

Though Company-HK1 had derecognized the loan in its accounts, the interest payments made by Company-HK1 to Company-F would be denied deduction under section 16(2)(c) because Company-F was not chargeable to profits tax in respect of the interest income it received. The interest received by Company-HK1  from  Company-HK2 remained chargeable to tax under section 14 alone or in conjunction with  section  15(1)(f)  depending  on  the  facts  of  the  case.    In  law, Company-HK1  would  remain  entitled to collect interest from Company-HK2.

**Example 2.5**

Same  facts  as  in  Example  2.4  except  that  Company-HK2  and Company-F were connected.

The interest payments made by Company-HK1 and Company-HK2 would be denied deduction under section 16(2B).

#### Legal form and economic substance

11. Pursuant to Hong Kong Accounting Standard 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation (HKAS 32), the issuer of a financial instrument shall classify  the  instrument,  or  its  component  parts,  on  initial  recognition  as  a financial liability, a financial asset or an equity instrument in accordance with the economic substance of the arrangement.
12. In analysing a financial instrument, the Commissioner takes the view that the starting point is to decide its nature according to its legal form rather than

the accounting treatment or the underlying economic characteristics. Determining the legal form of a financial instrument will involve an examination of the legal rights and obligations created by the instrument.    If the purported legal  form  of  a  financial  instrument  is  not  consistent  with  such  rights  and obligations, then it is necessary to look beyond the label given to the financial instrument.

13. The labels of 'liability' and 'equity' may not reflect the legal nature of the financial instrument.    In these circumstances, it is necessary to take into account other factors which include the character of the return (e.g. whether fixed rate return or profit participation), the nature of the holder's interest in the issuer company (e.g. voting rights and rights on winding-up), the existence of a debtor and creditor relationship and the characterization of the instrument by general law.

**Example 2.6**

Company-HK, registered under the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622), issued  preference  shares  with  a  par  value  of  $100  million  and  a dividend  of  10%  per  annum. Puttable  options  attached  to  the preference shares allowed the redemption of the instruments for cash. The holders would have rights to attend members' meetings, to receive notices  of  general  meetings  and  to  approve  resolutions. The directors would be allowed to omit the dividend without throwing the company into bankruptcy.

Though the preference shares are accounted for as financial liabilities and  the  dividends  declared  are  charged  as  interest  expenses  to  the profit and loss account under HKAS 32, the preference shares would be treated for tax purposes as share capital because the relationship between the holders and the company was not a debtor and creditor relationship.    Dividends declared would not be allowed for deduction as interest expenses and would not be assessed as interest income.

14. HKAS 32 requires the issuer of a compound financial instrument (e.g. a convertible debt instrument) to split the instrument into a 'liability component' and  an  'equity  component'  and  present  them  separately  in  the  statement  of financial position.    Since the accounting treatment would reflect the economic

substance,  the  interest,  discount,  premium  and  expense  attributable  to  equity component of the compound financial instrument should be denied deduction. Otherwise,  part  of  the  consideration  payable  for  the  compound  financial instrument but attributable to the equity component, which is capital in nature, will be allowed for deduction.

**Example 2.7**

Company-HK  issued  2,000  convertible  bonds  each  having  a  face value of $1,000,000 with a five-year term and an annual interest rate of 10%.    At any time up to maturity, each bond would be allowed to convert into 250,000 ordinary shares.    The terms of issue provided for a monetary settlement of bonds not having converted into ordinary shares.

Though in the accounts of Company-HK, the convertible bonds were split  in  accordance  with  HKAS  32  into  'equity  components'  and 'liability  components',  they  would  be  treated  in  whole  as  debts because  Company-HK  was  a  debtor  of  the  money  debt  and  the subordinate  right  to  convert  need  not  be  exercised. Since  the convertible bonds were issued with an embedded derivative recognized as an equity component, the part of the interest/ discount/ premium, if any, attributable to the equity component would not be allowed for deduction.    The remaining part of the interest/ discount/ premium would be allowed for deduction if the conditions in section 16 were satisfied.

#### Hedge accounting

15. It  is  normal  business  practice  for  a  company  to  engage  in  hedging activities in order to reduce its exposure to risk and uncertainty, such as changes in  prices,  interest  rates  or  foreign  exchange  rates.    Hedge  accounting  means designating one or more hedging instruments so that their change in fair value is offset, in whole or in part, to the change in fair value or cash flows of a hedged item.
16. HKFRS 9 provides guidance relating to hedging and allows hedge accounting where there is a designated hedging relationship between the hedging

instrument and a hedged item.    It is prohibited otherwise.    Hedge accounting is  therefore  not  mandatory.    An  entity  may  choose  to  continue  to  apply  the hedge accounting requirements  of  Hong  Kong  Accounting  Standard  39 Financial Instruments: Presentation and Measurement (HKAS 39) or apply the hedge accounting requirements of HKFRS 9.    As a practice, the Commissioner considers that the tax treatment should follow the accounting treatment of the hedging relationship.

17. If  the  hedging  relationship  qualifies  for  hedge  accounting  under HKAS 39 or HKFRS 9 and is accounted for as such, the Commissioner considers that  the  hedged  item  and  the  hedging  instrument  should  not  be  considered separately because hedging is an attempt to mitigate the impact of economic risks of the hedged items.    A distinct locality should not be imputed on to the hedging instrument and the locality of the hedging instrument should follow that of the hedged item.    Regarding  the  nature  of  the  profit  or  loss,  capital  or  revenue, arising from the hedging instrument, the Commissioner accepts that it depends on the nature of the hedged item.
18. Hedge accounting will not occur in any one of the following situations even though a hedge exists:
- (a) the hedge relationship fails to qualify for hedge accounting;
- (b) the hedge relationship qualifies for hedge accounting but it is not adopted; or
- (c) hedge accounting is  discontinued  because  the  hedge  becomes ineffective.
19. In the absence of hedge accounting, the hedging instrument and the hedged item are accounted for separately in the accounts.    It follows that the changes in their values are not set off against each other.    The tax treatments for the hedging instrument and the hedged item are therefore considered separately unless the hedging instrument is as a matter of fact a hedge against the hedged item  even  though  hedge  accounting  is  not  or  cannot  be  adopted.    That  may occur for example in the case of a small business where documentation is not properly done.    In such situations, the tax treatment of the hedging instrument and the hedged item may not necessarily be considered separately even though

they are accounted for separately in the accounts.    The facts and circumstances of each individual case have to be examined to determine whether the hedging instrument  is  really  a  hedge  against  the  hedged  item  and  should  be  treated together with the hedged item as a whole.

20. Enterprises sometimes control their group financial activities through a  central  treasury  unit  that  trades  with  external  third  parties.    This  avoids  a subsidiary  having  to  go  directly  to  the  market  to  find  a  hedge.    The  usual practice is for the central treasury unit to execute a hedge with an external third party  and  that  the  terms  and  conditions  of  that  hedge  are  passed  on  to  the subsidiary through an internal hedge.    An internal hedge will normally not be accepted  unless  there  is  a  corresponding  external  hedge  because  an  internal hedge will be eliminated on consolidation and will not achieve any commercial results for the group as a whole.    It is recognized and accepted that the netting of  exposures  within  a  group  on  an  arm's  length  basis  by  the  treasury  unit  is possible.    However, the taking of any net exposure would require a factual basis and would suggest that the central treasury unit is trading in derivatives.    Often a group treasury company would not be taking any position of significance.    In short, the Commissioner holds the view that hedge accounting should normally be available to those internal or centralized hedging activities with 'matched external transactions' that are entered into on a one for one basis.

**Example 2.8**

Company-HK  was  buying  and  selling  commodities  (e.g.  metals). The commodities were purchased from suppliers located in Australia and  sold  to  enterprises  located  overseas. The  profits  from  the commodity trade were fully assessable to profits tax.    To guarantee the sales prices of the commodities, Company-HK was to short futures contracts on the commodities with appropriate settlement dates on an overseas  exchange. The  futures  contracts  qualified  for  hedge accounting and were accounted for as such.

The locality and nature of the commodity futures followed those of the underlying onshore trading transactions.    The commodity futures were ancillary to the trading transactions and the intention was not to speculate in commodity futures.

**Example 2.9**

Company-HK whose functional currency was the Hong Kong dollar, carrying  on  a  garment  trading  business  in  Hong  Kong,  held  as investment yen-denominated shares listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and in order to eliminate the perceived risk of a fall in their value, entered into a forward contract with a local financial institution to sell for Hong Kong dollars an amount of yen equivalent to the yen value  of  the  shares. The  forward  contract  qualified  for  hedge accounting and was accounted for as such.

The  forward  contract  and  the  shares  would  be  given  similar  tax treatment because the forward contract was regarded as ancillary to the offshore capital transaction in shares.    The forward contract in essence was part and parcel of an offshore investment.

#### Embedded derivatives

21. An  embedded  derivative  is  a  component  of  a  hybrid  contract  that contains  a  non-derivative  host.    Embedded  derivatives  can  be  found  in  a number of financial instruments, including put options in bonds, callable bonds, put options on preference shares etc.    In form, a hybrid instrument remains one single instrument.
22. From the holder's perspective, the general rule under HKFRS 9 is that if  the  hybrid  contract  contains  a  host  that  is  an  asset  within  the  scope  of  the standard, the entire hybrid contract should be classified and measured as a whole. In the exceptional case that the hybrid contract contains a host that is not an asset within the scope of the standard, an embedded derivative should be separated from  the  host  and  accounted  for  as  a  derivative  under  certain  specified circumstances.
23. For tax purposes, the nature (i.e. capital or revenue) and locality of profit and loss of the hybrid instrument are determined on the basis that it is one single  instrument.    In  other  words,  the  nature  and  locality  of  profit  and  loss arising from the embedded derivative and the host contract should always be the same.    Under  HKFRS  9,  the  embedded  derivative  and  the  host  contract  are required  to  be  separated  under  certain  circumstances.    Notwithstanding  such accounting requirement, the same tax treatment will be applied because in form

the hybrid instrument is still one single instrument.

24. Where  the  embedded  derivative  has  been  separated  from  the  host contract and the accounting treatments of changes in the carrying amounts of the embedded derivative and the host contract differ, the Commissioner so far as timing of assessment is concerned is prepared to accept the accounting treatment under HKFRS 9 as the tax treatment under assessment on the fair value basis. The Commissioner does not accept that the entire gain will only be taxed in the year the hybrid instrument is sold.
