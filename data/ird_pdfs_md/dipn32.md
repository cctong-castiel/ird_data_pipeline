## INTRODUCTION

Article 108 of The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  specifies  that  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ('Hong Kong') shall have its own taxation  system. Over  recent  years,  with  increasing  activities  between  the Mainland  of  China  ('the  Mainland')  and  Hong  Kong,  businessmen  in  Hong Kong have, from time to time, encountered taxation difficulties when carrying on  business  in  the  Mainland. Differences  in  the  taxation  systems  of  the Mainland and Hong Kong have led to instances of double taxation. With a view to resolving such problems the governments of the Mainland and Hong Kong carried out consultations. The two Sides (i.e. the Mainland and Hong Kong) subsequently reached consensus in relation to a number of areas which are detailed in the 'Arrangement between the Mainland of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation on Income'  ('the  Arrangement'). On  11  February  1998  representatives  of  the two Sides signed the Memorandum to which the Arrangement is attached as an Annex.

## ARRANGEMENT FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION

2. For the purpose of giving effect to the Arrangement, the Specification of Arrangements (Arrangements with the Mainland of China for the Avoidance of Double Taxation on Income) Order ('the Order') was made by the Chief Executive in Council on 24 February 1998 under section 49 of the Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  ('the  IRO').    The  Order  was  published  in  the Gazette as Legal Notice 126 of 1998 (at Annex). Section 1 of the Order, in effect,  declares  that  arrangements  have been made with the Mainland for the avoidance of double taxation. Section 2 specifies that the Arrangement is set out in the Memorandum signed between the State Administration of Taxation of the Mainland of China and the Finance Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.    The Memorandum together with the Arrangement is set out in the Schedule to the Order.
3. The  purpose  of  the  Arrangement  is  to  allocate  the  right  to  tax between the two jurisdictions on a basis that avoids double taxation of income. The provisions of the Arrangement have been made by reference to the Model

Taxation  Conventions  of  the  Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and Development  and  the  United  Nations  that reflect  international  experience  in dealing  with  taxation  relations  between  countries  and  are  well  known  to practitioners handling the taxation affairs of multi-national businesses. Appropriate modifications have been made  to cope with the particular requirements  of  the  Mainland  and  Hong  Kong  and  to  help ensure  effective implementation of the Arrangement.

## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ARRANGEMENT AND THE INLAND REVENUE ORDINANCE

4. The Arrangement has been implemented in accordance with section 49 of the IRO. It is regarded as an integral part of the IRO and accordingly as having  the  same  legal  effect.    The  Arrangement  and  the  IRO  (including subsidiary  legislation)  are  interrelated  and  complement  each  other.    The Arrangement allocates the right to tax between the two tax jurisdictions. Both Sides  shall  continue  to  refer  to  their  respective  domestic  taxation  laws  to resolve  problems  of  tax  administration  and  enforcement,  such  as  in  deciding whether  certain  income  should  be  subject  to  tax,  and  in  the  computation  of assessable income and tax payable.    Resolution of these matters will help to ensure the correct and effective implementation of the Arrangement. Matters not covered by the Arrangement shall continue to be dealt with in accordance with the laws and regulations of both Sides.
5. In  handling  problems  arising  from  any  inconsistency  between  the Arrangement and the IRO, priority will generally be accorded to the Arrangement. However,  where  the  terms  of  the  Arrangement  are  less favourable  than  those  under  the  general  provisions  of  the  IRO  the  matter  in question will normally be dealt with in accordance with the general provisions.
6. The Arrangement should not affect existing concessional practices. Take  for  example  the  case  of  a  Hong  Kong  manufacturer  who  concludes  a processing arrangement with a Mainland entity. In accordance with paragraphs 30 to 44 of Departmental Interpretation &amp; Practice Notes No. 21 (Revised 2009), 50% of his profits may be regarded as profits arising outside Hong Kong and not chargeable to profits tax in Hong Kong. This method of apportioning profits that arise both inside and outside Hong Kong on a 50:50

basis  remains  applicable. On a strict  interpretation  of  the  Arrangement,  the Mainland processing factory could be regarded as a permanent establishment of the  Hong  Kong  manufacturer  in  the  Mainland  and  liable  to  tax  there. However,  it  is  noted  that  it  is  not  the  present  intention  of  the  Mainland  to change the way it taxes profits derived from this type of operation.

## IMPLEMENTATION DATES

7. The Arrangement entered into force on 10 April 1998, the date by which  the  two  Sides  had  notified  each  other  that  their  requisite  approval procedures  had  been  completed. The  Arrangement  has  effect  in  respect  of income  derived  from  the  Mainland  on  or  after  1  July  1998  and  to  income derived from Hong Kong in any year of assessment commencing on or after 1 April 1998. The Mainland adopts the calendar year as its taxation year whilst Hong  Kong  adopts  as  its  year  of  assessment  the  period  of  12  months commencing 1 April. The different  dates  of  effect  are  necessary  to  comply with  the  respective  domestic  laws  of  the  two  Sides. Although  the  dates  of effect  are  3  months  apart,  this  is  not  expected  to  give  rise  to  any  problems. Tax  paid  in  the  Mainland  by  a  Hong  Kong  resident,  in  respect  of  income derived from the Mainland for the period from 1 April to June 30 1998, will be allowed for set off as a tax credit pursuant to Article 4 (Methods of elimination of double taxation) of the Arrangement.
8. A Hong Kong enterprise may adopt as its accounting date 31 March or  any  other  date  within  a  year  of  assessment. The  'basis  period'  for  the enterprise will be the year ending on the accounting date that falls within that year of assessment. The basis period for the year of assessment 1998/99 may therefore commence as early as 2 April 1997 (i.e. the period from 2 April 1997 to 1 April 1998). Income derived during that basis period will be dealt with in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Arrangement.    Pursuant  to  section 18E(1) of the IRO, the Commissioner of the Inland Revenue ('the Commissioner')  will  determine  the  basis  period  as  he  thinks  fit  in  any  case where an enterprise changes its accounting date during the year of assessment 1998/99.

## ARTICLE 1 A PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT AND ITS BUSINESS PROFITS

### The concept of a permanent establishment

9. Hong  Kong  adopts  the  'territorial  source  principle'  in  charging profits tax.    Profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong are assessable to tax whilst profits arising in a territory outside Hong Kong are not chargeable to tax. With  regard  to  profits  generated  from  a  Hong  Kong  business  involving cross-border activities, it is sometimes not easy to ascertain whether the profits have a source in the Mainland or in Hong Kong, because activities have taken place in both places. This may result in double taxation.
10. In common with many double taxation agreements, the Arrangement uses the concept of a 'permanent establishment' to determine where tax is to be imposed and hence addresses the issue of double taxation. Paragraph 1 of Article 1 provides that ' profits  of  an  enterprise  of  One  Side  shall  be  taxable only on that Side unless the enterprise carries on business on the Other Side through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on  business  as  aforesaid,  the  profits  of  the  enterprise  may  be  taxed  on  the Other  Side  but  only  so  much  of  them  as  is  attributable  to  that  permanent establishment .' The criterion for determining whether One Side can impose tax on profits derived by an enterprise of the Other Side is whether the business activities of the enterprise are of such a nature that they constitute a permanent establishment.
11. Three  concepts,  namely,  space  (a  fixed  place  of  business),  time (continuous or aggregate periods) and function (activities of a preparatory or auxiliary character), are used to ascertain whether the activities of an enterprise of One  Side constitute a permanent establishment on the Other Side. Paragraph 2 of Article 1 generally explains that a permanent establishment is a fixed place of business through which the business activities of the enterprise are carried on. There is no qualification on the scale or the form of the place of  business. A  permanent  establishment  will  normally  have  the  following features:
- (1) It must be a place of business. This may include a house, a site, equipment or facilities (such as machinery and equipment), a warehouse, a stall, etc., for the carrying out of business activities, whether owned by the enterprise or rented.
- (2) It  must  be  a  fixed  place  of  business  of  a  permanent  nature. The temporary interruption or suspension of business activities  conducted  at  a  fixed  place  of  business  shall  not affect the existence of a permanent establishment.
- (3) The  enterprise  must  carry  on  the  whole  or  a  part  of  its business activities at the place of business.
12. Paragraph 3 of Article 1 provides that the term 'permanent establishment'  includes  in  particular  ' a  place  of  management,  a  branch,  an office, a factory, a workshop, a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place  of  extraction  of  natural  resources'. This  list  is  not  exhaustive,  but illustrates  several  of  the  main  examples  of  what,  prima  facie,  constitute  a permanent establishment. It does not preclude the determination of any other place of business as a permanent establishment in accordance with the general definition of the term.
13. The 'place of management' mentioned indicates that some supervisory responsibilities for the enterprise may be exercised from that place of  business. It  is  not  a  reference  to  the  'head  office'  or  'place  of  effective management' that is used to identify where a company is resident.    Paragraph 8 specifically provides that a company which is a resident of One Side will not be a permanent establishment of a company of the Other Side just because it controls or is controlled by that company, which is a resident of the Other Side, or which carries on business on that Other Side.

### A building site, a construction, assembly or installation project

14. Paragraph  4  of  Article  1  provides  that  a  permanent  establishment also includes ' a building site, a construction, assembly or installation project or  supervisory  activities  in  connection  therewith,  but  only  where  such  site, project or activities continue for a period of more than 6 months '. The IRO imposes  tax  on  income  derived  from  contracting  work  carried  out  in  Hong Kong in accordance with the territorial source principle. The duration of the work  is  not  a  relevant  factor.    However,  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement,

chargeability of profits in respect of contracting work carried out in Hong Kong by a resident of the Mainland will be governed by the duration of the work. The  Arrangement  provides  that  a  building  site,  a  construction,  assembly  or installation project will only be regarded as constituting a permanent establishment in Hong Kong (and therefore be subject to tax) if it lasts for more than six months. Profits  from  a  project  that  does  not  last  for  more  than  six months  will  not  be  subject  to  tax  in  Hong  Kong. Similarly,  a  Hong  Kong resident who has a project in the Mainland that does not last for more than six months will also not be regarded as having a permanent establishment in the Mainland and accordingly will not be subject to tax there.

15. The period for which a project is carried out is counted from the date the  contractor  commences work (including all preparatory activities) up until the date of completion of the work and the hand over of the work completed. If the period covers two years, the period is counted on a continuous basis over the years in question. In a case where two or more sub-projects are contracted for by a person at the same site or for the same project, the period is counted from  the  date  of  commencement  of  the  first  sub-project  to  the  date  of completion  of  the  last  subproject  of  that  person.    In  other  words,  it  is considered that where two or more sub-projects are contracted for at the same site or for the same project they are but part of a single project. On the other hand,  where  the  sub-projects  are  situated  at different localities  and  are contracted  for  different  projects,  the  respective  periods  may  be  counted separately. In such a case a permanent establishment would not be considered to exist if the project does not exceed the time limit of six months. Similarly, a project that does not last for more than six months will not be regarded as a permanent  establishment  merely  because  another  project  of  the  enterprise constitutes a permanent establishment.
16. Where, after  commencement of work, a project is suspended, (e.g. pending the arrival of equipment and materials or because of bad weather), the project will not normally be treated as terminated.    The duration of the project will,  in  such  a  case,  be  counted  continuously  without  any  deduction  for  the days the project is suspended.
17. If the enterprise subcontracts part of a project to a subcontractor who commences work earlier than the contractor, then in accordance with paragraph 15  above,  the  duration  of  the  entire  project  is  counted  from  the  date  the

subcontractor commences work up to the date of completion and hand over of the  work  completed. This  method  of  counting  the  period  for  the  contractor does not affect the independent determination of whether the subcontractor has a permanent establishment. If the period of the subcontracted works does not last longer than six months it will not constitute a permanent establishment and exemption from profits tax in Hong  Kong  can  be granted under the Arrangement if the subcontractor is a resident of the Mainland.

### Provision of services by an enterprise

18. Paragraph  4  of  Article  1  provides  that  a  permanent  establishment also includes  ' services, including consultancy services, furnished  by  an enterprise  of  One  Side,  through  employees  or  other  personnel  on  the  Other Side, provided that such services have been furnished for the same project or a connected project for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 6 months in any 12-month period .'
19. The scope of consultancy services includes:
- (1) improvement of production facilities  and  products,  selection of  technical  know-how,  or  enhancement  of  supervisory  and management skills, etc.;
- (2) the feasibility analysis of investment projects and the selection of design plans.
20. The counting of 'a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 6 months in any 12-month period' may commence with any month during the course  of  a  service  contract. Where  services  have  been  furnished  by  an enterprise  through  employees  or  other  personnel  on  the  other  Side  for  a continuous  or  cumulative  period  of  more  than  six  months  in  any  12-month period,  a  permanent  establishment  is  regarded  as  being  present  on  the  other Side, and the income derived from rendering those services will be subject to tax.

### The place where preparatory or auxiliary activities are conducted

21. In defining a permanent establishment, the Arrangement excludes a

fixed  place  of  business  whose  activities,  for  the  enterprise,  are  purely  of  a preparatory or auxiliary character. This reflects the fact that activities which are of a preparatory or auxiliary character do not themselves directly produce profits.

22. Paragraph 5 of Article 1 lists  various  activities  of  a  preparatory  or auxiliary character that may  be carried out for the enterprise without constituting a permanent establishment.    They include:
- (1) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;
- (2) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery;
- (3) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to  the  enterprise  solely  for  the  purpose  of  processing  by another enterprise;
- (4) the  maintenance  of  a  fixed  place  of  business  solely  for  the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise, or of advertising, or of collecting information, for the enterprise;
- (5) the  maintenance  of  a  fixed  place  of  business  solely  for  the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character;
- (6) the  maintenance  of  a  fixed  place  of  business  solely  for  any combination  of  the  activities  mentioned  in  items  (1)  to  (5) above, provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character.
23. The purpose of paragraph 5 is to clarify what are genuine 'representative offices' that are not regarded as permanent establishments and subject to tax. However, attention should be drawn to the following:

- (1) The activities should be for the enterprise itself;
- (2) The activities should not directly generate profits;
- (3) The  function  of  the  place  of  business  should  only  be  of  a supportive  nature.    If  the  fixed  place  of  business  conducts certain  supervisory  management  functions  for  the  enterprise or  manages  certain  business  operations,  its  activities  would not  be  regarded  as  being  of  the  required  character. In  this event,  the  fixed  place  of  business  would  be  regarded  as  a permanent establishment.

Where  the  activities  carried  out  by  a  representative  office  go  beyond  the activities set out in sub-paragraphs (1) to (6) of paragraph 5, that representative office shall be regarded as a permanent establishment. The business profits of the  office  will  be  taxed  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  regulations  of  the Mainland or Hong Kong.

### Business agent

24. Paragraph 6 of Article 1 provides that an agent, other than an agent of an independent status (i.e. an agent acting under the control and leadership of an enterprise of One Side), who regularly acts on behalf of that enterprise on the Other Side and has an authority to conclude contracts (including participation  and  decision  making  in  the  negotiation  of  the  contract  terms), shall be regarded as a permanent establishment of that enterprise. This is the case even  though  the  agent is not the final signatory to the contract. Paragraph  7  states  that  the  activities  of  an  enterprise  conducted  through  an independent agent shall not be regarded as constituting a permanent establishment. However, when the agent is acting wholly or almost wholly on behalf  of  the  enterprise,  he  will  not  be  regarded  as  an  agent  of  independent status. The  scope  of  his  duties  and  responsibilities  and  whether  he  has  the right to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise will determine whether or not the agent is considered a permanent establishment of the enterprise.

### The meaning of business profits

25. The term 'profits' in paragraph 1 of Article 1 is not defined in the

Arrangement. Its meaning is to be ascertained in accordance with the laws of both Sides. In the Mainland, profits refer to all profits derived by an enterprise directly  from  its  business  activities. In  Hong  Kong,  profits  refer  to  the business profits derived by an enterprise and are computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the provisions of the IRO.

26. The  Arrangement  currently  only  includes  those  items  on  which consensus has been reached. The treatment of other items such as interest and royalties has yet to be resolved. Furthermore, items that do not arise from the carrying  on  of  a  business,  such  as  gains  from  immovable  property,  rent  and gains of a capital nature,  have  not  been  given  special  mention  in  the Arrangement  as  double  taxation  does  not  generally  arise.    The  ordinary provisions of the respective tax laws remain applicable. The chargeability of such passive income will depend on whether they are derived from a business carried on by an enterprise through a permanent establishment or a fixed base. Thus,  if  the  derivation  by  a  Hong  Kong  resident  of  the  above  items  is substantially connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in the Mainland, these items would be regarded as part of the business profits of  the  permanent  establishment  and  be  subject  to  tax  in  the  Mainland. However, if the Hong Kong resident does not have a permanent establishment in the Mainland,  his  business  profits will not be subject to tax there. Nevertheless,  other  items  such  as  dividends,  interest,  royalties,  capital  gains, and rent derived from  the Mainland  will be subject to tax (including withholding tax) in accordance with the tax law of the Mainland.

## ARTICLE 2 SHIPPING, AIR AND LAND TRANSPORT

27. Article  2  provides  that  revenue  and  profits  from  the  operation  of ships, aircraft or land transport vehicles carried on by an enterprise of One Side shall be exempt from tax on the Other Side insofar as the revenue and profits are derived from an international or cross-border transportation business.    The taxes exempted in the Mainland include Enterprises Income Tax and Business Tax. Enterprises  Income  Tax  is  calculated  by  reference  to  profits  whereas Business Tax is calculated by reference to revenue. Accordingly, the Article specifically  includes  revenue  and  profits  in  the  scope  of  the  exemption. Revenue  and  profits  of  an  enterprise,  derived  from  services  other  than international  or  cross-border  transportation,  will  not  be  exempt  by  the  Other

Side if such services are provided through a permanent establishment situated on that Other Side. The exemption under this Article also covers revenue and profits derived from participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.

### Shipping transport

28. Article 2 is regarded as having application to a Hong Kong enterprise that carries on a business (by reference to section 23B of the IRO) as an owner of ships and:
- (1) the business of the enterprise is  normally  controlled  or managed in Hong Kong; or
- (2) the enterprise is a company incorporated in Hong Kong,
29. The terms of the Arrangement provide that Hong Kong has the right to impose tax on a Hong Kong enterprise in respect of profits derived from its shipping  business. However,  section  23B  provides  that,  for  an  enterprise deemed  to  be  carrying  on  a  business  in  Hong  Kong  as  an  owner  of  ships, 'relevant  sums'  (as  defined  in  Section  23B  (12))  does  not  include  any  sums derived  from,  attributable  to,  or  in  respect  of  any  relevant  carriage  shipped aboard  a  'registered  ship'  (as  defined  in  Section  23B  (12))  at  any  location within the waters of Hong Kong. The ratio of relevant sums to total shipping revenue is used to apportion the world-wide shipping profits of the Hong Kong shipowner  and  calculate  the  assessable  shipping  profits  derived  from  Hong Kong. Sums from relevant carriage shipped aboard a registered ship at any location  within  the  waters  of  Hong  Kong  by  a  Hong  Kong  enterprise  will continue to be exempt from tax in Hong Kong.

### Air transport

30. Article 2 is regarded as having application to a Hong Kong enterprise that carries on a business (by reference to section 23C of the IRO) as an owner of aircraft and:
- (1) the business of the enterprise is  normally  controlled  or managed in Hong Kong; or
- (2) the enterprise is a company incorporated in Hong Kong.

31. Hong Kong has the right to impose tax on a Hong Kong air transport enterprise  in  respect  of  the  revenue  derived  from  the  operation  of  an  air transport business. According to section 23C, 'relevant sums' (as defined in Section 23C (5)) includes any sums derived from, attributable to, or in respect of any relevant carriage shipped in Hong Kong and any relevant charter hire. The  proportion  of  relevant sums  to  total revenue  is used  to  apportion world-wide aircraft profits and calculate assessable aircraft profits derived from Hong Kong. By virtue of section 23C(2A), sums from relevant carriage and charter hire from the Mainland derived by a Hong Kong air transport enterprise, that are exempt from tax in the Mainland under the Arrangement, are included as relevant sums in calculating profits chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.

### Land transport

32. Article 2 is regarded as having application to a Hong Kong enterprise that  carries  on  a  business  of  land  transport.    A  land  transport  business  is subject to tax under section 14 of the IRO. That is, any person who carries on a  land  transport  business  in  Hong  Kong  is  chargeable  to  tax  on  the  profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong.
33. The Arrangement provides that a Hong  Kong  land transport enterprise will only be subject to tax in Hong Kong and will be exempt from Enterprises  Income  Tax  and  Business  Tax  in  the  Mainland.    Similarly, revenue  earned  by  a  Mainland  land  transport  enterprise  from  Hong  Kong uplifts to the Mainland will also be exempt from profits tax in Hong Kong.
34. A  cross-border  land  transport  business  between  the  Mainland  and Hong Kong usually takes the form of a co-operative enterprise.    Typically the Hong Kong participant will make his investment in the form of vehicles and capital. The  Mainland  participant  will  be  responsible  for  the  application  of permits  and  licences,  tax  compliance  and  other  management  services. The Hong  Kong  participant  will  be  responsible  for  Hong  Kong  uplifts  and  the Mainland  participant  for  uplifts  in  the  Mainland.    Occasionally,  the  Hong Kong participant may enter into a contract with the customer for the return trip. This kind of cooperative enterprise is regarded as a joint business of cross-border  transport operated  by  residents of both  Sides. It follows,

pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 2, that the respective share of profits derived by each participant from the joint business operation will be exempt from tax by the Other Side and will be taxed on the Side of which the participant is a resident in accordance with its taxation laws.

## ARTICLE 3 PERSONAL SERVICES

35. With the development of capital, technological and cultural exchanges,  and  increasing  trading  relationships,  between  the  Mainland  and Hong  Kong,  more  and  more  people  from  various  walks  of  life  (e.g.  sales personnel, engineers, self-employed  persons, artistes, and  athletes),  have become involved in cross-border businesses, professions and trades and in the provision  of  services. The  situation  may  be  complicated  because  some persons may stay for a short period of time whilst others may stay on a long term basis. Some persons may even be regarded as residents in accordance with  the  taxation  laws  of  both  Sides. Two  situations  are  dealt  with  in  the Arrangement - independent personal services and dependent personal services.

### Independent personal services

36. The  term  'independent  personal  services'  as  used  in  the  Article generally refers to professional services and other activities of an independent character (e.g. scientific, literary, artistic, educational and teaching activities, as well as the professional activities of physicians, lawyers, engineers, architects and accountants) exercised by an individual independently. The term does not include professional services performed as an employee.
37. Paragraph 1 of Article 3 provides that income derived by a resident of  One  Side  in  respect  of  professional  services  or  other  activities  of  an independent  character  shall  be  taxable  only  on  that  Side. However,  where either of the following conditions is satisfied, the income may be taxed on the Other Side:
- (1) if  the resident has a fixed base regularly available to him on the  Other  Side  for  the  purpose  of  performing  professional services  or  other  activities  of  an  independent  character,  but only  so  much  of  the  income  as  is  attributable  to  that  fixed base;
- (2) if the resident stays on the Other Side for a period or periods exceeding  in  the  aggregate  183  days  in  the  calendar  year concerned, but only so much of the income as is derived from activities performed on that Other Side.

38. The Mainland interprets the term 'in the calendar year concerned' as the period from 1 January to 31 December of any single calendar year. So far as Hong Kong is concerned, a resident of the Mainland who is in Hong Kong for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in a calendar year is chargeable to Hong  Kong  profits tax on income from independent professional services exercised in Hong Kong.    When the period exceeds 183 days,  the  profits  will  be  assessed  in  Hong  Kong  by  reference  to  the  year  of assessment  in  which  they  accrue  to  the  person.    For  example,  during  the calendar  year  1  January  to  31  December  1999  a  Mainland  resident  stays  in Hong Kong for more than 183 days during the period from 1 January to 31 July. Income  derived  during  the  period  1  January  to  31  March  1999  would  be assessed  in  the  year  of  assessment  1998/1999. Income  derived  during  the period  1  April  to  31  July  1999  would  be  assessed  in  the  year  of  assessment 1999/2000. If applicable, regard will be had to the accounting period adopted by the person for the purpose of determining the relevant basis period.

### Dependent personal services

39. The term 'dependent personal services' as used in the Article, refers to  an  employment  exercised  by  an  individual  with  an  employer  (i.e.  as  an employee).    Paragraph 2(1) of this Article provides that ' salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of One Side in respect of an employment  shall  be  taxable  only  on  that  Side  unless  the  employment  is exercised  on  the  Other  Side. If  the  employment  is  so  exercised,  such remuneration  as  is  derived  therefrom  may  be  taxed  on  the  Other  Side .' However,  remuneration  derived  by  a  resident  of  One  Side  in  respect  of  an employment exercised on the Other Side will be exempt from tax on that Other Side if the following three conditions set out in paragraph 2(2) of this Article are satisfied:
- (1) the recipient stays on that Other Side for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in the calendar year concerned;
- (2) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of that Other Side;
- (3) the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has on that Other Side.

40. A resident of One Side who is assigned to the Other Side to act as the representative or as a staff member of a representative office of an enterprise is to  be  treated  as  a  permanent  staff  member  with  a  fixed  employment  on  the Other Side. The tax exemption for stays 'not exceeding 183 days' does not apply to such a person regardless of who pays his salary or wages or where he is  paid. The exemption also does not apply to a period of preparatory work done by a permanent representative before he is formally appointed, or to the period  of  work  done  by  a  staff  member  before  his  formal  appointment. However, if the person is ultimately not appointed as a permanent representative  or  as  a  staff  member  of  the  representative  office,  he  can  be treated  as  a  staff  member  staying  for  a  short  period  of  time. Provided  the other  conditions  of  the  Article  are  satisfied  (such  as  the  requirement  that  the stay  not  exceed  183  days),  the  person's  salary  and  wages  derived  from  the Other Side will be exempt from tax on the Other Side.
41. Paragraph  4(2)  of  Article  1  provides  that  consultancy  services furnished by an enterprise of One Side through employees on the Other Side for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 6 months in any 12-month period  constitutes  a  permanent  establishment  on  that  Other  Side.    This remains the case even where individual employees stay on that Other Side for a period not exceeding 183 days in the calendar year concerned.    Their services are  regarded  as  having  been  provided  by  that  permanent  establishment. In practice, income derived by such employees from the provision of services on that  Other  Side  may  be  regarded  as  borne  by  the  permanent  establishment (because condition (2) or (3) above is not satisfied) and accordingly be taxed in accordance with the law of that Other Side.
42. A resident who is employed or engaged in independent professional services in a territory outside the Mainland and Hong Kong, or who is assigned by an enterprise of either the Mainland or Hong Kong to work elsewhere will cease to be entitled to the exemption offered by the Arrangement if he is liable to tax in that territory as a resident in accordance with the laws of that territory governing the periods of his residence.

43. Apart from the provisions of the Arrangement, income derived by a Hong  Kong  resident  from  a  Hong  Kong  employment  in  respect  of  services rendered by him in any territory outside Hong Kong (including the Mainland) may continue to  be  exempt  from  Salaries  Tax  under  section  8(1A)(c)  of  the IRO. This is subject to the proviso that the Hong Kong resident has paid tax of substantially the same nature as Salaries Tax in respect of that income in the territory  where  the  services  are  rendered.    A  resident  of  Hong  Kong  can therefore be granted exemption in respect of the income derived from services rendered in the Mainland which is chargeable to Individual Income Tax in the Mainland. Double taxation of such income should therefore not arise.
44. A resident of Hong Kong who has declared and paid Salaries Tax on his  employment  income  and  who  has  paid  Individual  Income  Tax  in  the Mainland because he has rendered services there, can apply, under section 70A of the IRO, to have his assessment revised in accordance with the provisions of section 8(1A)(c).

### Other personal services

#### (I) Directors' fees

45. Paragraph  3  of  Article  3  provides  that  directors'  fees  and  other similar payments derived by a resident of one Side in his capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the Other Side may be taxed on that Other Side. Thus directors' fees received by a resident of Hong Kong from a company resident in the Mainland may be taxed in the Mainland. Likewise,  directors'  fees  received  by  a  resident  of  the  Mainland from a company resident in Hong Kong may be taxed in Hong Kong. This applies regardless of the period of stay of the director concerned on the Other Side or the place where the services are rendered.    'Directors' fees and other similar  payments'  do  not  include  wages,  salaries  and  other  remuneration derived by a director as an employee, a consultant, etc. Such wages, salaries and  other  remuneration  are  taxed  as  remuneration  from  dependent  personal services. They  are not included as 'directors' fees and other similar payments' derived as a member of the board of directors.

#### (II) Artistes and athletes

46. Paragraph  4(1)  of  this  Article  provides  that  ' income  derived  by  a resident  of  One  Side  as  an  entertainer  ......,  or  a  musician,  or  as  an  athlete, from his personal activities as such exercised on the Other Side may be taxed on that Other Side .' An entertainer, a musician, or an athlete, resident of One Side,  who  performs  on  the  Other  Side  may  derive  substantial  amounts  of income. However, their stay may only be for a short period of time, usually less than 183 days, and they may not have a fixed base. Therefore they will not be subject to the provisions relating to independent or dependent personal services  set  out  in  the  Arrangement  and  the  Side  where  they  provide  their services would not be able to tax their income. Accordingly, paragraph 4(1) provides that income derived by such a person from his activities may be taxed on the Side where his activities are exercised. Paragraph 4(2) stipulates that the  income  in  respect  of  the  personal  activities  of  such  a  person,  whether accruing to himself or to 'another person' will be taxed on the Side where his activities are exercised. The term 'another person' includes a company or an enterprise. This is intended to ensure that all income derived by such a person from performance activities can be taxed on the Side where the activities are exercised.

## ARTICLE 4 METHODS OF ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION

47. Article 4 provides that double taxation can be eliminated under the Arrangement by the allowance of a tax credit. In  the  case  of  a  Hong  Kong resident deriving income that is subject to tax in Hong Kong, any tax paid in the  Mainland  in  respect  of  that  income  shall  be  allowed  as  a  credit  (in accordance with the provisions of the Arrangement) against the Hong Kong tax payable  on  that  income. The  amount  of  the  tax  credit  cannot  exceed  the amount of tax payable in respect of that income, computed in accordance with the provisions of the IRO.
48. The Arrangement provides that the method of elimination of double taxation adopted in Hong Kong shall be subject to the provisions of the IRO regarding  the  allowance  of  a  deduction  or  a  credit. Section  50  of  the  IRO provides  for  the  allowance  of  a  tax  credit  in  respect  of  arrangements  having

effect under section 49. This section provides the basis for the granting of a tax credit in relation to an item of income stipulated in the Arrangement and in respect  of  which  tax  has  been  paid  in  the  Mainland.    Only  tax  paid  in  the Mainland can be allowed as a credit under the Arrangement against Hong Kong tax. In accordance with section 50(2), an applicant for a tax credit must be a resident  in  Hong  Kong  for  the  year  of  assessment  in  which  the  income  is earned. However,  if  income  derived  by  a  Hong  Kong  resident  from  the Mainland does not arise from Hong Kong it will not be chargeable to tax in Hong Kong. No tax credit will be allowed as the question of double taxation does not arise. In  the  case  of  a  Hong  Kong  manufacturer whose profits are apportioned  on  a  50:50  basis,  only  half  of  the  profits  will  be  taxed  in  Hong Kong. The other half is regarded as having been derived from the Mainland thus not chargeable to tax in Hong Kong. Under such circumstances, where tax  has  been  paid  in  the  Mainland  in  respect  of  half  or  less  than  half  of  the profits, such tax shall not be allowed as a credit against Hong Kong tax payable. If  more  than  one  half  of  the  profits  are  regarded  by  the  Mainland  as  profits derived therefrom, then the tax paid in the Mainland in respect of such profits, in excess of one half of the total profits, will be allowed as a credit against the tax payable in Hong Kong.

49. The tax credit in respect of tax paid in the Mainland allowable for set off in Hong Kong is computed in accordance with sections 50(3) and 50(5) of the IRO as follows:

(Note 1)  In accordance with section 50(5), the amount of tax paid in the Mainland not allowed as a tax credit, i.e. $102 ($165 - $63), can be allowed as a deduction as shown in the detailed computation below:

(Note 2) The formula of the credit limit is based on section 50(3) and 50(5) of the IRO.    If the tax payable by a taxpayer is computed at flat rate, the following simplified formula can be used to compute the credit limit:

| Credit limit of tax = paid in the Mainland                       | Income in the Mainland                                           | Tax payable in Hong Kong x Total assessable income   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Income from the Mainland                                         | Income from the Mainland                                         | $500                                                 |
| Tax payable in Hong Kong before allowance of tax credit          | Tax payable in Hong Kong before allowance of tax credit          | $240                                                 |
| Total assessable income                                          | Total assessable income                                          | $1,500                                               |
| Tax credit limit in respect of tax paid in the Mainland = $500 x | Tax credit limit in respect of tax paid in the Mainland = $500 x | 240 1500                                             |

50. In  the  case  of  an  individual  taxpayer  whose  tax  is  computed  at progressive tax rates, the tax credit is computed as follows:

**[Example 2]**

| Total Hong Kong income                   | $200,000   |
|------------------------------------------|------------|
| Including gross income from the Mainland | $120,000   |

| Tax rate in the Mainland                 | 8.33%      |
| Net income after tax from the Mainland   | $110,000   |

The effective tax rate in Hong Kong and the tax credit are computed as follows:

|                                   |                                   | $       |

51. The  computation  of  tax  credits  where  the  Mainland  has  deemed service income to be derived from the Mainland:

**[Example 3]**

1. Hong Kong Resident Company

Total business receipts (from Hong Kong and the Mainland)

$15,000,000

Total assessable profits

$1,000,000

Profits tax rate (Corporation) 16%

Tax payable

$1,000,000 x 16% =

$160,000

2. Mainland Contract

Contract price for the sale of machinery and equipment including installation (which takes more than 6 months to complete) to the Special Economic Zone of the Mainland (Tax rate: 15%)

Deemed percentage of installation fee over total contract price 5%

Deemed income in respect of installation work

$2,000,000

$2,000,000 x 5%

= $100,000

Deemed profit margin

10%

Deemed profits

$100,000 x 10%

= $10,000

Enterprises Income Tax in the Mainland

= $10,000 x 15%

= $1,500

Tax credit in respect of deemed income from installation work in the Mainland

- = Tax payable x

Deemed profits of installation work in the Mainland

Total assessable profits

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- = $1,600

Actual  tax  credit  allowed  is  to  be  restricted  to  the  actual  tax  paid  in  the Mainland, i.e. $1,500

52. Section  50(4)  of  the  IRO  provides  that  the  total  tax  credit  to  be allowed to a Hong Kong resident for a year of assessment in respect of foreign tax paid shall not exceed the total tax payable in Hong Kong for that year of assessment. Therefore,  if  a  Hong  Kong  resident  suffers  a  loss  in  a  year  of assessment and does not pay any Hong Kong tax, the tax paid by him in the Mainland will not be allowed as a credit.    Moreover, if a Hong Kong company with  a  branch  in  the  Mainland  suffers  an  overall  loss,  whereas  the  branch records a profit, no tax credit will be allowed in Hong Kong for any tax paid in the  Mainland,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  trading  results  of  the  branch have been included in the Hong Kong accounts. It should be noted that under the  territorial  source  principle,  profits  derived  from  the  Mainland  by  a  Hong Kong taxpayer generally fall to be excluded from the computation of assessable profits  in  Hong  Kong. Therefore,  the  allowance  of  a  tax  credit  should  not arise.
53. Under  section  50(5)  the  amount  of  tax  paid  in  the  Mainland  is included  in  computing  profits  or  income  subject  to  tax  in  Hong  Kong. However, due to the differences in tax rates between the Mainland and Hong Kong, the tax paid in the Mainland may exceed the amount of the tax credit. In such circumstances, the excess is allowed as a deduction. Any tax paid in the  Mainland  that  is  not  allowed  as  a  credit  is  not  available  to  be  carried forward  to  subsequent  years  of  assessment.    A  claim  for  a  tax  credit  is,  in accordance with section 50(9), to be made within 2 years after the end of the relevant year of assessment. The claim can be submitted with the tax return for the relevant year of assessment or made separately in writing. A dispute over the allowance of a tax credit is to be dealt with in accordance with the objection and appeal provisions of the IRO.
54. A Hong Kong resident who considers that the tax credit is excessive or insufficient because of an adjustment to the amount of tax payable by either Side  can  make  a  claim  within  2  years  from  the  time  when  the  assessment, adjustment or determination has been made. The period for lodging the claim will not be limited by the time for raising an assessment or for lodgement of any  other  claim  under  the  IRO.    The  relevant  assessment,  adjustment  or determination must be material in determining whether and to what extent a tax credit is allowable.

55. Before  a  tax  credit  is  allowed  it  will  need  to  be  established  to  the satisfaction of the Inland Revenue Department ('the Department') that the tax has been paid by the person in the Mainland. The person will need to submit the  tax  computation  issued  by  the  tax  authority  of  the  Mainland  (showing details of the relevant income and tax paid thereon) together with a certificate to  the  effect  that  the  tax  has  been  paid  and  is  not  subject  to  any  further adjustment.

## ARTICLE 5 CONSULTATION

56. The  Arrangement  is  a  bilateral  agreement  made  after  consultation between representatives of the Mainland and Hong Kong which allocates the right  to  tax  between  the  two  jurisdictions.    It  sets  out  mainly  matters  of principle. In  the  course  of  applying  the  Arrangement,  it  is  possible  that problems or uncertainties in respect of particular provisions may be encountered. For this reason, Article 5 provides that the competent authorities of the two Sides shall endeavour to resolve by consultation any difficulties or doubts arising in relation to the interpretation or application of the Arrangement. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in respect of issues not provided for in the Arrangement. To facilitate reaching  consensus,  consultation  may  take  the  form  of  an  oral  exchange  of opinions.    Consultation  in  respect  of  the  Arrangement  shall  be  dealt  with centrally by the State Administration of Taxation of the Mainland and by the Inland Revenue Department of Hong Kong.
57. The Arrangement does not set out the procedures a taxpayer should follow when he is of the view that the Arrangement should be applied.    Where a  taxpayer  wishes  to  make  a  claim,  the  competent  authorities  of  both  Sides have agreed that the claim should first be lodged with the tax authority of the Side which the taxpayer believes has not imposed tax in conformity with the Arrangement. In practice, the procedures and time limit for lodging a claim are based on the provisions regarding objections and appeals of the tax laws of the relevant Side. Some claims are expected to be resolved unilaterally. In the  event  that  a  claim  cannot  be  settled  unilaterally  or  is  not  dealt  with expeditiously through normal procedures of that Side, the taxpayer may ask the competent authority of the Side of which he is a resident, in accordance with legal  procedures  and  time  limits,  to  deal  with  the  problem  through  mutual

consultation. If,  at  any  stage,  the  competent  authority  receiving  the  claim considers  that it is reasonable,  but  nevertheless cannot  settle the  claim satisfactorily,  it  will  try  to  resolve  the  problem  by  consultation  with  the competent authority of the Other Side. Once agreement is reached as to how the claim is to be dealt with, it will be processed without regard to any time limit which might otherwise apply under the laws of either Side.

58. A resident of the Mainland who considers that an assessment, raised by the Department, is not in conformity with the provisions of the Arrangement should first lodge a written objection with the Commissioner within one month from the date of issue of the assessment. The objection will then be dealt with in accordance with the objection and appeal provisions of the IRO.
59. Where a resident of Hong Kong has lodged a claim in the Mainland, and it is not settled expeditiously, the person may forward a copy of the letter of claim to the Commissioner. The person should also provide the Commissioner  with  all  information  relevant  to  the  case  (e.g.  details  of  the activities  carried  out  in  the  Mainland  and  details  of  negotiations  with  the competent  authority  of  the  Mainland  including  copies  of  documents,  letters, notices of assessment and demand notes). Where appropriate the Commissioner  will  consult  the  competent  authority  of  the  Mainland.    A decision reached after such consultation is not subject to further appeal.
60. The  secrecy  provisions  of  section  4  of  the  IRO  only  allow  the Commissioner  to  provide  information  to  the  competent  authority  of  the Mainland  where  the  disclosure  has  been  authorized  in  writing  by  the  Hong Kong  resident. The  Commissioner  may  also  decline  to  consult  with  the competent authority of the Mainland if insufficient information is provided by the  person,  or  the  grounds  of  the  claim  are  not  valid,  or  the  person  does  not authorize the Commissioner in writing to disclose the relevant information.

## ARTICLE 6 PERSONAL SCOPE AND TAXES COVERED

### Personal scope

61. The  purpose  of  the  Arrangement  is  for  the  avoidance  of  double taxation  in  the  Mainland  and  Hong  Kong. The  Arrangement  only  has

application to a person who is a resident of either Side. Paragraph 1 of Article 6 of the Arrangement states that the term 'resident' means 'any person who is liable to tax of One Side by reason of his residence, domicile, place of effective management, place of head office or any other criterion of a similar nature in accordance with the laws of the respective Sides' . In relation to the definition, 'residence' and 'domicile' are of relevance to individuals, whereas the 'place of effective management' and 'place of head office' are pertinent to persons other than individuals.

62. The term resident is not defined in the IRO, but is commonly used in relation to taxation. In the case of an individual, the meaning of the term and related  expressions  has  been  considered  on  a  number  of  occasions  by  the Courts and the Board of Review. In relation to a claim for dependent parent allowance, the Board of Review held in decision D13/90:
2. ' To be a permanent resident a person must be physically present in Hong Kong on a permanent basis or having been physically in Hong Kong and having established permanent residence and the duration of absence from Hong Kong is on a temporary basis only.'

Board of Review cases D20/83 and D57/87 have also been concerned with the same issue.

63. For  the  purposes  of  the  Arrangement,  in  determining  whether  a 'person' is a 'resident', and may thus enjoy the benefits of the Arrangement, regard will be had to the following criteria:

#### (I) Resident 'individual'

An individual is considered to be a resident of Hong Kong if he is liable to tax in Hong Kong and he is:

- (1) of  or  above  the  age  of  18  years,  or  under  that  age  if  both parents are deceased; and
- (2) a permanent or temporary resident.

64. Reflecting existing definitions in the IRO, it is accepted that in this context a 'permanent resident' means an individual who ordinarily resides in Hong Kong. A 'temporary resident' means an individual who stays in Hong Kong for a period or a number of periods amounting to more than 180 days in the year of assessment or for a period or periods amounting to more than 300 days  in  2  consecutive  years  of  assessment  (one  of  which  is  the  year  of assessment in respect of which the claim is made). It is generally considered that  an  individual  'ordinarily  resides'  in  Hong  Kong  if  he  has  a  permanent home in Hong Kong where he or his family lives.

#### (II) Resident 'company'

65. The  definition  of  'person'  in  Article  7  provides  that  the  term includes a 'company'. Further, the definition states that 'the term 'company' means any body corporate or any entity which is treated as a body corporate for tax  purposes'.    Whilst  neither  the  Arrangement  nor  the  IRO  contains  a definition of a 'resident company' the concept is a familiar one in relation to taxation matters. In  this  regard,  it  is  accepted  that  a  company  is  resident  in Hong  Kong  if  its  central  management  and  control  is  in  Hong  Kong  (i.e. satisfying 'any other criterion of a similar nature' as set out in the definition of 'resident' in paragraph 1(1) of Article 6). This position reflects case law.
66. According to precedent cases, the residence of a company is wholly a  question  of  fact  ( Bullock  v.  The  Unit  Construction  Co.,  Ltd. 38 TC 712 at page 741).    Also, according to the judgement of Lord Loreburn in De Beers Consolidated  Mine,  Limited  v.  Howe (5  TC  198  at  page  213),  the  place  of central management and control is the place where the real business is carried on:
3. '....  a  company  resides,  for  the  purposes  of  Income  Tax,  where  its real business is carried on. .... I regard that as the true rule; and the real  business  is  carried  on  where  the  central  management  and control actually abides.'
67. The  issue  of  whether  a  company  was  centrally  managed  and controlled  outside  Hong  Kong  or  in  Hong  Kong  was  critically  examined  in Board of Review Decision Case No. D123/02, 18 IRBRD 150 . In ascertaining where  a  limited  company  resides,  the  Department  will  follow  the  guiding

principles mentioned in paragraphs 16 to 18 of the Departmental Interpretation &amp; Practice Notes No. 10 (Revised 2007).

68. Decisions of the Courts and the Board of Review have emphasized that the place of central management and control is wholly a question of fact. Any such decision by the Board of Review can only be subsequently set aside if it is held that the Board has not observed proper legal principles.
69. In Swedish Central Railway Company Limited v. Thompson (9  TC 342) it was held that:
3. ' When the central management and control of a company abides in a particular place, the company is held for purposes of Income Tax to have a residence in that place, but it does not follow that it cannot have a residence elsewhere.... The central management and control of a company may be divided, and if so it may 'keep house and do business' in more than one place; and if so, it may have more than one residence.'
70. The  place  of  registration  or  incorporation  of  a  company  is  not  in itself  conclusive  of  the  place  where  the  central  management  and  control  is exercised  and  is  therefore  not  conclusive  of  the  place  where  the  company  is resident ( Todd v. Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Co. Ltd. 14 TC 119).
71. Some  decisions  have  attached  importance  to  the  place  where  the company's  board of directors meet. However,  this is not necessarily conclusive. If  the  central  management  and  control  is  exercised  by  a  single individual,  the  company  will  be  resident  where  that  individual  exercises  his powers. In this situation, the Department may have to look at the place where that  individual ordinarily resides in ascertaining the place of residence of the company. The place of directors' meetings is significant only insofar as those meetings constitute the medium through which central management and control is exercised. If the directors of a company are actively engaged in a particular place in running a business wholly located in that place, the company will not be  regarded  as  resident  outside  that  place  merely  because  the  directors  hold meetings outside that place. The conclusion is wholly one of fact, depending on the relative weight to be given to various factors. It is not possible to lay down rigid guidelines.

72. The central management and control of a company does not depend upon the power of supreme command or final arbitrament. It  can  be  found where there are not only substantial business operations in a given place, but some  part  of  the  superior  and  directing  authority  of  the  company  are  also present (Union Corporation Limited v. CIR 34 TC 207).
73. Where a subsidiary company operates in a different territory  to  its parent company, the Department will not, as a matter of course, seek to argue that the central management and control of the company is located where the parent company is resident. However, this will not be the case if the parent company assumes the functions of the board of the subsidiary, or if the board of  the  subsidiary  automatically  endorses  decisions  of  the  parent  company without giving them independent consideration.    In determining whether the board of a subsidiary company itself exercises central management and control, the  Department  will  examine  the  degree  of  autonomy  of  the  directors  in conducting the business of the subsidiary. Regard will be had to factors such as the extent to which the directors make decisions on their own authority in relation to, where applicable, investment, production, marketing and procurement activities of the subsidiary.
74. When  making  a  decision  in  accordance  with  case  law  principles, only  factors  which  exist  for  genuine  commercial  reasons  will  be  accepted. Where  it  appears  to  the  Department  that  a  major  objective  underlying  the existence of certain factors is the obtaining of a tax benefit, the facts will be examined  closely  to  ensure  that  any  appearance  of  central  management  and control in a particular place matches the reality.

#### (III) Resident 'body of persons'

75. Apart  from  referring  to  an  'individual'  and  a  'company',  the definition of 'person' in Article 7 also includes 'any other body of persons'. In the latter regard partnerships are the category most likely to be encountered. A  partnership  is  treated  as  an  independent  entity  for  tax  purposes  in  Hong Kong. The  Department  considers  that  a  partnership  is  resident  where  its effective  management  and  control  is  located. In  considering  this  question, regard  will  be  had  to  factors  such  as  the  place  where  the  partnership  is established, the place where its day-to-day business is carried out, the place of residence of the managing partners and the place where the general meetings of the partners are held.

### Certification of resident status

76. In applying the Arrangement, the tax authority of the Mainland may require an individual, a company, or a body of persons to produce a certificate from the Department certifying that the person is a 'resident' of Hong Kong. This  would  generally  only  be  required  where  there  is  a  possibility  that  the person is a resident of both Sides, or there is a need to verify the resident status of  the  person. Such  a  certificate  will  only  be  issued  by  the  Department  if required by the tax authority of the Mainland. In this regard, the tax authority of the Mainland will first request the person to complete an 'Application for Treatment Under Double Taxation Agreement'. After  it  has  been  approved and  stamped  by  the  Mainland  tax  authority,  this  application  form  is  to  be submitted by the person to the Department together with the 'Application for Certification of Resident Status' which can be obtained from the Department. Specimens  of  the  certification  application  forms  are  at  Appendix  1  (for  an individual) and Appendix 2 (for a company or a body of persons). Explanatory notes for completion are printed on the reverse of the actual forms.

77. The Department will examine the information supplied by the person, and  if  it  is  sufficient  issue  a  Certificate  of  Hong  Kong  Resident  Status  for purposes of the Arrangement specimen certificates are at Appendices 3, 4 and Where  the  information  submitted  is  insufficient  the  Department  will advise the person of the additional material required.
78. On the other hand, where the Department is unable to ascertain that a person  is  a  resident  of  the  Mainland  and  entitled  to  the  benefits  of  the Arrangement,  it  will  require  that  person  to  furnish  a  certificate  of  resident status from a tax authority of the Mainland. If the person is unable to produce such a certificate from the tax authority of the Mainland, he will not be entitled to the benefits of the Arrangement.
79. Where an individual is regarded as a resident of both the Mainland and  Hong  Kong,  his  status,  for  the  purposes  of  the  Arrangement,  will  be determined in accordance with paragraph 1(2) of Article 6:
- (i) he shall be regarded as a resident of the Side on which he has a permanent  home  available  to  him;  if  he  has  a  permanent  home available to him on both Sides, he shall be regarded as a resident of

the Side with which his personal and economic relations are closer ('centre of vital interests');

- (ii) if the Side on which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent home available to him on either Side, he shall be regarded as a resident of the Side on which he has an habitual abode;

- (iii) if he has an habitual abode on both Sides or on neither of them, the competent authorities of the two Sides shall settle the question by consultation.'

80. Paragraph 1(3) provides that where a person other than an individual (e.g.  a  company  or  a  partnership)  is  a  resident  of  both  Sides,  the  competent authorities of the two Sides shall determine its residential status by consultation.

### Taxes covered

81. Paragraph 2 of Article 6 specifies the taxes to which the Arrangement applies. For the Mainland, the applicable taxes are direct taxes, namely,  Individual  Income  Tax,  Foreign  Investment  Enterprises  Income  Tax and  Foreign  Enterprises  Income  Tax.    Business  Tax  is  also  specifically included  by  virtue  of  Article  2  in  connection  with  shipping,  air  and  land transport. For Hong Kong, the applicable taxes are Profits Tax, Salaries Tax and tax charged under Personal Assessment. Other taxes are not included in the scope of the Arrangement.
82. Although the Mainland taxes include Foreign Investment Enterprises Income Tax and Foreign Enterprises Income Tax, not all revenue items covered by  these  taxes  enjoy  the  benefits  of  the  Arrangement. Only  those  items  of income  specifically  included  in  the  Articles  of  the  Arrangement  enjoy  the benefits of the Arrangement. Similarly in Hong Kong, the benefits accorded to residents of the Mainland and the tax credits available to residents of Hong Kong  will only be granted in accordance with the provisions of the Arrangement.

## ARTICLE 7 GENERAL DEFINITIONS

### The meaning of the term 'person'

83. The  term  'person'  has  a  wide  meaning  in  the  Arrangement.    It includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons. The term 'any  other  body  of  persons'  is  not  defined  in  the  Arrangement,  but  it  is considered to include a partnership.

### The meaning of the term 'company'

84. The term 'company' also has a wide meaning.    The Arrangement provides  that  the  term  means 'any  body  corporate  or  any  entity  which  is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes' .

### 'Enterprise of One Side' and 'enterprise of the Other Side'

85. The  Arrangement  does  not  define  what  is  meant  by  the  term 'enterprise'; it is construed in accordance with the laws of the two Sides. The terms 'enterprise of One Side' and 'enterprise of the Other Side' respectively mean 'an enterprise carried on by a resident of One Side and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the Other Side' . An enterprise may be carried on by a resident company, or a resident individual, while the enterprise itself may not be a resident.

## CONCLUSION

86. It is believed that the Arrangement will help to resolve problems of double  taxation  faced  by  residents  of  the  Mainland  and  Hong  Kong  and promote  commercial  and  trading  activities  between  the  two  Sides.    The Arrangement provides a channel for communication between the tax authorities of the  two  Sides. In the future, if it is necessary, the scope  of  the Arrangement  can  be  extended,  through  consultation,  to  cover  other  items subject to double taxation.
