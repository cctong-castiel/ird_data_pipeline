## INTRODUCTION

### Distinguishing sukuk from conventional bonds

The Inland Revenue and Stamp Duty Legislation (Alternative Bond Schemes)  (Amendment)  Ordinance  2013  (the  Amendment  Ordinance)  was enacted  by  the  Legislative  Council  in  July  2013  to  bring  particular  types  of arrangements that are economically equivalent to debt arrangements under tax rules  comparable  to  those  applying  to  debt  arrangements  and  to  give  stamp duty  relief  in  relation  to  those  types  of  arrangements.    This  Departmental Interpretation and Practice Note sets out the Department's views and practice on  the  application  of  the  provisions  in  section  40AB  and  Schedule  17A  (the Schedule) of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (the IRO) whereas Stamp Office Interpretation  and  Practice  Notes  No.  6  will  cover  the  interpretation  and practice of relevant provisions in the Stamp Duty Ordinance.

2. Issuance of conventional bonds is not consistent with Sharia principles  which  prohibit  payments  for  use  of  money  (i.e.  interest).    To accommodate  that precept, alternative financial arrangements have been developed.    The  return  from  many  of  these  arrangements  is  economically equivalent  to  interest.    The  Amendment  Ordinance  adopts  a  religion  neutral approach,  stipulating  the  conditions  under  which  arrangements  are  treated  as debt arrangements. In Shamil Bank of Bahrain EC v Beximco Pharmaceuticals  Ltd and  Others  [2004]  4  AllER  1072,  the  English  Court  of Appeal  held  that  English  law  alone  was  the  governing  law  even  though  the governing law clause was subject to Sharia principles.
3. Though commonly called Islamic bonds, sukuk (the plural of sakk) are in essence trust certificates backed by Sharia-acceptable assets.    The form of the documentation and the issue process are similar to those of an issue of conventional  bonds.    However,  the  instrument,  rather  than  being  a  debt obligation,  confers  rights  on  the  holders  as  beneficiaries  under  a  trust  of  the relevant asset backing the deal.    The holders' return is thus profit derived from their  beneficial  ownership  of  the  asset  rather  than  interest  on  a  debt.    Many sukuk are economically equivalent to conventional bonds but some sukuk are non-debt arrangements (e.g. equity instruments).

## ALTERNATIVE BOND SCHEME

### Basic structure

4. The term 'alternative bond scheme' (ABS) is used in the Amendment Ordinance to represent the arrangements which will be treated as debt arrangements for profits tax purposes upon fulfilment of certain conditions. Section 40AB in Part 6A refers to the Schedule which contains the provisions about the tax treatment of specified ABSs.
5. Generally,  the  ABS  is  a  tripartite  structure  with  the  following participants:
- (a) the originator (the O) which may  be in substance the borrower;
- (b) the  bond-issuer  (the  BI)  which  must  be  a  special  purpose vehicle (the SPV); and
- (c) the bond-holders (the BHs).

The BI and the BHs enter into a bond arrangement (the BA) while the BI and the  O  enter  into  an  investment  arrangement  (the  IA).    Under  the  BA, alternative bonds are issued to the BHs.    Under the IA, assets are acquired and managed with a view to generating income or gains to fund the payments to the BHs in the BA.

**Example 1**

Company-BI issued alternative bonds to Companies-BH under a BA. Company-BI  entered  into  an  IA  with  Company-O  under  which  the bond proceeds were used to acquire an asset to generate income and gains to fund payments to the Companies-BH.

The tripartite structure comprised a BA and an IA with Company-O, Company-BI and Companies-BH as the participants.    The structure fell within the definition of ABS and the provisions in the Schedule would apply to the structure if other conditions are satisfied.

**Example 2**

To fund the acquisition of machinery for its own trade, Company-BI issued trust certificates under an arrangement to Companies-BH.

The  bipartite  structure  did  not  fall  within  the  definition  of  ABS. The provisions in the Schedule would not apply to the structure.

6. A specified ABS means an ABS with the IA being one of the four specified IAs and the terms of the ABS and IA remain the same throughout the specified term. The  four specified  IAs and  the  corresponding  Islamic transactions/contracts are listed below:

| Investment Arrangement        | Islamic Transaction/Contract   |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Lease arrangement             | Ijara                          |
| Profits sharing arrangement   | Musharaka and Mudaraba         |
| Purchase and sale arrangement | Murabaha                       |
| Agency arrangement            | Wakala                         |

**Example 3**

Company-BI issued alternative bonds to Companies-BH under a BA. The IA between Company-BI and Company-O was a lease arrangement.    The  terms  of  the  ABS  and  IA  remained  unchanged throughout the specified term.

Since  the  IA  was  a  specified  IA  and  the  terms  of  the  ABS  and  IA remained unchanged throughout the specified term, the ABS was a specified  ABS.    If  the  lease  arrangement  had  been  changed  to  an agency arrangement before the alternative bonds were fully redeemed  or  cancelled,  the  ABS  would  not  have  been  a  specified ABS.

**Example 4**

Company-BI issued alternative bonds to Companies-BH under a BA. Company-BI and Company-O entered into an IA which consisted of a lease arrangement and a purchase and sale arrangement.

The  scheme  was  not  covered  by  the  Schedule  because  it  had  two specified  IAs.    The  Commissioner  having  considered  all  the  facts and  circumstances  would  decide  whether  such  a  hybrid  structure, made up of two specified IAs, could be accepted as a specified ABS.

7. The BA in a specified ABS is a qualified BA if the specified ABS has always complied with:
- (a) the reasonable commercial return condition;
- (b) the BA as financial liability condition;
- (c) the Hong Kong connection condition;
- (d) the maximum term length condition; and
- (e) the arrangements performed according to terms condition.

If the BA in a specified ABS is a qualified BA, it would be regarded as a debt arrangement.

8. The specified IA in a specified ABS is a qualified IA if:
- (a) throughout  the  specified  term,  the  BA  in  the  specified  ABS has always been a qualified BA; and
- (b) the specified ABS has always complied with:
    - (i) the BI as conduit condition, and
    - (ii) the IA as financial liability condition.

If the specified IA in a specified ABS is a qualified IA, it would be regarded as a debt arrangement.

9. The  BA  in  a  specified  ABS  is  regarded  as  never  having  been  a qualified  BA  in  the  specified  ABS  if  a  BA  disqualifying  event  occurs  in relation to the BA at any time during the specified term.    Equally, the IA in a specified ABS is regarded as never having been a qualified IA in the specified ABS if an IA disqualifying event occurs in relation to the specified IA at any time during the specified term.    The effect is that the debt treatment accorded to  the  BA  and  the  IA  will  be  withdrawn  retrospectively,  and  assessments, additional assessments or reassessments will be raised accordingly.

### Special purpose vehicle

10. The  BI  in  an  ABS  must  be  an  SPV  which  is  a  corporation, partnership or any other entity established solely for the purposes of the ABS and  does  not  carry  on  any  trade  or  activities  except  for  the  purposes  of  the ABS.
11. The  definition  excludes  an  SPV  which  is  engaged  in  business activities apart from the alternative bond issuance.    However, an SPV set up for  more than one ABS with the same O is regarded as the SPV for each of those  schemes.    The  relaxation  will  accommodate  cases  where  an  SPV  is  to issue a series of alternative bonds under an issuance programme.

**Example 5**

Company-BI  had issued conventional bonds which were fully redeemed. Company-O made use of Company-BI to issue alternative bonds.

Company-BI did not meet the definition of an SPV since it was not established solely for the purposes of the ABS in question and was previously involved in issuance of conventional bonds.

**Example 6**

Company-BI  was  established  as  a  property  holding  company  but became dormant after disposal of its properties. Company-O made use of Company-BI to issue alternative bonds.

Company-BI  did  not  meet  the  definition  of  SPV  since  it  was  not established solely for the purposes of the ABS in question and was involved in property investment.

**Example 7**

Company-O  set  up  Company-BI  solely  for  the  purpose  of  an alternative  bond  issuance  programme  under  which  Company-BI issued  a  series  of  alternative  bonds  under  four  ABSs.    The  IAs  in

two  ABSs  were  lease  arrangements  while  the  IAs  in  the  remaining two ABSs were profits sharing arrangements.

Company-BI was set up for an issuance programme and was the SPV in  relation  to  each  of  the  four  ABSs.    It  was  covered  by  the definition of SPV.

**Example 8**

Company-O  set  up  Company-BI  solely  for  the  purpose  of  an alternative  bond  issuance  programme  under  which  four  series  of alternative bonds were issued.    In two ABSs, the IAs were specified IAs while in the remaining two ABSs, the IAs were not specified IAs.

Company-BI met the definition of SPV since IAs were not required to  be  specified  IAs.    However,  only  two  ABSs  with  specified  IAs would be specified ABSs.

### Specified term

12. Similar  to  debt  arrangements,  ABSs  normally  have  a  fixed  term. Section 2(2) of the Schedule requires the ABS to have a specified term which commences on the date the alternative bonds are issued and ends on the date they  are  fully  redeemed  or  cancelled  under  the  terms  of  the  BA.    The  'end date' usually refers to the scheduled redemption or cancellation date stated in the  offering  document  or  to  a  rescheduled  redemption  or  cancellation  date which is agreed by the Commissioner.

**Example 9**

On 1 October 2013, Company-BI issued to Companies-BH alternative  bonds  with  a  3-year  term  redeemable  on  30  September 2016.    Pursuant  to  an  IA,  Company-BI  purchased  assets  from Company-O with the bond proceeds and made arrangement for the management  of  the  assets.    Because  of  liquidity  problems,  the redemption  date  of the alternative  bonds  was  extended  to  30 September 2018.

The  specified  term  of  the  ABS  was  initially  three  years  (i.e.  1 October 2013 to 30 September 2016).    It was subsequently changed to  five  years  (i.e.  1  October  2013  to  30  September  2018).    The extended  specified  term  was  conditional  on  the  agreement  of  the Commissioner.

### Essential features of a BA

13. The essential  features  of  a  BA  are  described  in  section  2(3)  of  the Schedule.    In a BA, the initial BHs pay the bond proceeds to the BI and the BI:
- (a) enters into an IA with the O;
- (b) issues alternative bonds to the BHs; and
- (c) undertakes  to  use  the  investment  return  and  proceeds  of disposal under the IA for payment of the redemption payment and additional payments.
14. If the alternative bonds are transferable, the transferee of an alternative bond becomes the holder of the alternative bond after the transfer. Section 2(3)(e) of the Schedule provides that a BH can be either an initial or a subsequent  BH.    Thus  the  initial  investors  and  subsequent  buyers  in  the secondary  market  of  alternative  bonds  are  regarded  as  the  BHs  and  are  in  a position comparable to initial investors and subsequent buyers of conventional bonds.
15. The redemption payment is economically equivalent to the principal repayment in conventional bonds. Additional payments are periodic distributions to the BHs out of the income or gains derived from the IA and are functionally similar to interest payments in conventional bonds. The additional payments may be fixed or determined by reference to a benchmark rate.    In  other  words,  alternative  bonds  can  be  structured  either  as  fixed  rate instruments or floating rate instruments.    The BHs however are not to profit from any increase in the value of asset acquired with the bond proceeds.
16. Similar to conventional bonds, alternative bonds may be issued at a discount or redeemed at a premium.    The par value above the discount price and the redemption premium would form part of the redemption payment and

not  additional  payments.    There  is  no  requirement  in  the  Schedule  that  the BHs should receive back the issued price paid for the alternative bonds at the end of the specified term of the ABS.    In other words, alternative bonds are subject to credit risks no different from those of conventional bonds.

17. Though not expressly provided in the Schedule, the alternative bonds may be exchangeable like some of the conventional bonds.    That means the redemption may be satisfied by shares in the O or other companies.    Since the BI is an SPV, the alternative bonds are not expected to be converted into shares in the BI.
18. The alternative bonds represent the rights and interests of the BHs in or in relation to the specified asset which was acquired by the BI under an IA with  the  bond  proceeds.    This  is  the  most  significant  feature  distinguishing alternative bonds from conventional bonds which only represent the debt owed by the BI to the BHs.

### Specified asset

19. The specified asset is the asset acquired by the BI under an IA with the  bond  proceeds  from  a  BA.    The  specified  asset  includes  a  replacement asset  acquired  upon  the  disposal,  destruction  or  loss  of  the  original  specified asset.
20. Section 1(2) of the Schedule defines the term 'asset' as any property or any class of property. 'Property' as defined in section 3 of the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 1) includes:
- (a) money, goods, choses in action and land; and
- (b) obligations, easements and every description of estate, interest and profit, present or future, vested or contingent, arising out of or incident to property as defined in paragraph (a).
21. Since  the  term  'asset'  is  given  a  very  wide  meaning,  it  should include  tangible  and  intangible  assets,  whether  a  specific  asset  or  a  class  of assets.    The specified asset may be held until the end of the specified term or may be replaced during the specified term.

**Example 10**

Bank-O and Company-BI entered into an IA which was an agency arrangement.    Bank-O  as  Company-BI's  agent  used  the  bond proceeds to  acquire a  portfolio  of  equities,  equity  linked  notes  and depositary  receipts.    During  the  specified  term  of  the  ABS,  after disposal of the equities and equity linked notes, Bank-O as Company-BI's agent used the proceeds of disposal to acquire some debt securities.

The  equities,  equity linked  notes, depositary  receipts  and  debt securities would constitute specified assets of the ABS.

### Essential features of an IA

22. The essential features of an IA are described in section 2(4) of the Schedule.    The IA is an arrangement between the BI and the O, under which the BI:
- (a) uses the bond proceeds to acquire the specified asset;
- (b) arranges for the management of the specified asset to generate investment return during the specified term; and
- (c) is to dispose of the specified asset by the end of the specified term for a consideration (i.e. proceeds of disposal).

The specific features of each of the specified IAs in section 5 of the Schedule are further prescribed in sections 6 to 9 of the Schedule.

23. Legal  fees, procuration fees, stamp  duties and  other  expenses incidental to the issue of alternative bonds paid out of the bond proceeds will be treated by the Commissioner as part of the acquisition cost of the specified asset.
24. Depending on the type of IA and the terms of the IA, the specified asset  may be acquired from the O or a third party.    In the acquisition of the specified asset, the BI may obtain legal or beneficial interests in properties or rights to income.

25. The term 'management' has a wide meaning.    Section 3(2) of the Schedule defines the term 'management' to include the disposal and replacement  of  the  specified  asset.    The  BI  is  not  required  to  undertake  the management.    An  agent,  such  as  the  O,  can  be  appointed  to  perform  the management activities.    In a lease arrangement, the management activities are often documented in a service agreement or a management agreement.    In a profits  sharing  arrangement  or  an  agency  arrangement,  the  management activities  are  often  documented  in  the  partnership  agreement  or  the  agency agreement.    In  a  purchase  and  sale  arrangement,  management  activities  are often minimal given that the specified asset is immediately resold by the BI to the O after acquisition.
26. The BI is required to dispose of the specified asset by the end of the specified term.    The disposal may take place earlier than originally scheduled due to the early redemption or cancellation of alternative bonds.    The disposal may also be postponed if the O, due to insolvency, delays or fails to honour the pre-agreed purchase of the specified asset from the BI.    In fact, section 28 of the Schedule may accommodate such a delay.
27. The  BI  is  required  to  use  the  investment  return  and  proceeds  of disposal  under  the  IA  or  part  of  these  sums  for  payment  of  the  redemption payment  and  additional  payments.    The  BI  or  the  O  may  arrange  a  top-up facility  to  meet  payments  in  case  the  investment  return  and  proceeds  of disposal are insufficient to fund the redemption payment  or additional payments payable to the BHs under the BA.

## SPECIFIED INVESTMENT ARRANGEMENTS

28. Section 5 of the Schedule specifies four types of IAs, namely:
- (a) a lease arrangement;
- (b) a profits sharing arrangement;
- (c) a purchase and sale arrangement; or
- (d) an agency arrangement.

Sections  6,  7,  8  and  9  of  the  Schedule  further  provide  for  the  details  of  the structures of the specified IAs.

### Lease arrangement

29. The  provisions  in  section  6  of  the  Schedule  which  relate  to  lease arrangements  are  intended  to  cover  ijara  structures.    If  an  arrangement satisfies the conditions therein, it will be regarded as a lease arrangement.

#### Specific features

30. In a lease arrangement, the BI:
- (a) uses  the  bond  proceeds  (the  acquisition  cost)  to  acquire  the specified asset;
- (b) is  to  hold  the  specified  asset  until  the  end  of  the  specified term;
- (c) leases the specified asset to the O for a specified income; and
- (d) is to dispose of the specified asset to the O, whether or not in stages,  by  the  end  of  the  specified  term  in  return  for  the proceeds of disposal.
31. The BI may acquire the asset from the O or a third party.    The third party may or may not be an associate of the BI or the O.
32. The  specified  asset  may  be  a  lease  granted  to  the  BI  by  the  O  in respect of immovable properties or other assets held by the O.    For example, after  acquiring  a  lease  of  a  commercial  building  from  the  O,  the  BI  may sublease it back to the O for a number of years.    In this connection, to acquire the asset means to obtain the lease; to lease the asset means to sub-lease; and to dispose of the asset means to surrender the lease.
33. Section 6(2) of the Schedule allows for replacement of the specified asset in whole or in part subject to the following conditions:
- (a) if  the  replaced  asset  is  not  destroyed  or  lost,  the  replacing asset  is  acquired  from  a  person  in  consideration  of  the disposal of the replaced asset to that person;
1(b) if the replaced asset is destroyed or lost, the replacing asset is acquired from a person with the consideration received for the disposal  to  that  person  of  any  remains  of  the  replaced  asset and  any  insurance  money  and  other  compensation  arising from the destruction or loss;
- (c) the person in (a) or (b) above is either the O or the third party from whom the specified asset was initially acquired with the bond proceeds;
- (d) the replacing asset for a replacement in whole or the replacing asset and the remainder asset for a replacement in part must be subject to the specified ABS until any further replacement.
34. The lease arrangement may involve co-ownership of an asset.    If the O  and  the  BI  contribute  cash  to  acquire  an  asset  or  the  O  sells  part  of  the proprietary  interest  in  an  asset  to  the  BI,  the  O  and  the  BI  would  become co-owners of the asset.    The BI then leases its share of the asset to the O in return for rental income and the O undertakes to purchase the BI's share of the asset  by  the  end  of  the  specified  term.    The  arrangement  though  involving co-ownership of the asset by the O and the BI would be a lease arrangement.

#### The originator

35. In a lease arrangement, the O is the lessee of the specified asset and the person to whom the BI will dispose of the specified asset by the end of the specified term as described in section 6(1)(c) and (1)(d) of the Schedule.

#### Specified income

36. The specified income under a lease arrangement is the consideration payable by the O to the BI for leasing the specified asset as described in section 6(1)(c) of the Schedule.
37. Where  the  terms  of  the  lease  arrangement  require  payment  of  an additional  rent  to  reimburse  the  BI  the  expenses  incurred  by  the  BI  for  the repairs and maintenance of the specified asset, the additional rent will not be counted  as  specified  income  for  the  purposes  of  calculating  the  investment return if it is fully offset by the repairs and maintenance expenses incurred by the BI.
38. On the destruction or loss of the specified asset, if the insurance or other  compensation  and  the  consideration  received  for  the  disposal  of  any

remains  are  not  wholly  used  for  redemption  of  the  alternative  bonds  or acquisition of a replacing asset, the unused amount will be treated as specified income under section 10(5)(b) of the Schedule.

#### Specified asset transaction between the originator and the bond issuer

39. The specified  asset  transaction  refers  to  any  acquisition,  leasing  or disposal of the specified asset, in whole or in part, by the BI from or to the O as explained  in  section  6(3)  of  the  Schedule.    If  the  lease  arrangement  is  a qualified IA, the specified asset transaction will be disregarded for profits tax and property tax purposes according to section 22(3)(a) of the Schedule.

#### Investment return

40. Section 10 of the Schedule describes the formula for calculating the investment return paid or payable in a period as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- A : the  total  amount  of  specified  income  paid  or  payable  in  the period
- B : the  specified  proceeds  of  disposal  paid  or  payable  in  the period
- C : the specified acquisition cost paid or payable in the period
- D : the total amount of any other sums paid or payable by the O to the BI in the period

If the proceeds of disposal are applied towards the full or partial redemption of the alternative bonds, specified proceeds of disposal means the sum of:

- (a) the consideration for the disposal of the whole or part of the specified asset; and
- (b) the  insurance  and  compensation  money  arising  from  the destruction or loss of the whole or part of the specified asset and any consideration received for the disposal of any remains.

If the proceeds of disposal are applied towards the full or partial redemption of the alternative bonds, specified acquisition cost means the sum of:

- (a) the  acquisition  cost  attributable  to  the  whole  or  part  of  the specified asset disposed of; and
- (b) the  acquisition  cost  attributable  to  the  whole  or  part  of  the specified asset destroyed or lost.
41. The  following  examples  illustrate  the  working  of  the  provisions relevant to lease arrangements and the calculation of investment return under lease arrangements.

**Example 11**

Under a specified ABS, Company-O and Company-BI entered into a lease arrangement and Company-BI issued alternative bonds of $800 million with a specified term of 5 years and used the bond proceeds to  acquire  Building-1  from  Company-O.    Building-1  was  leased back  to  Company-O  for  a  period  of  5  years.    By  a  purchase  and sale  undertaking,  Company-O  agreed  to  buy  back  Building-1  at  a price of $800 million at the end of the specified term.

After 3 years, Company-O decided to sell Building-1 to a third party and executed a deed of exchange whereby Company-BI transferred Building-1 to Company-O and Company-O transferred Building-2 to Company-BI.    Building-2 was subject to the same terms of the ABS applicable to Building-1 for the remainder of the specified term.

Company-BI acquired Building-2 from Company-O in consideration of the disposal of Building-1 to Company-O.    The replacement met the conditions under section 6(2) of the Schedule.

If Company-BI had directly disposed of Building-1 to the third party purchaser in consideration of Company-O's transfer of Building-2 to it, the replacement would not have met the conditions in section 6(2) since the third party purchaser was not the same person from whom Building-2 was acquired.

If  Building-1 and Building-2 (after the replacement) were leased to Company-O at a  monthly  rent  of  $1  million,  the  specified  income was  the  monthly  rent  of  $1  million.    If  Company-BI  disposed  of Building-2 to Company-O and used the proceeds of disposal of $800 million to redeem the alternative bonds, both the specified proceeds of disposal and the specified acquisition cost would be $800 million.

**Example 12**

On  1  October  2013,  Company-BI  issued  $600  million  alternative bonds in the form of trust certificates with a 3-year term under an ABS.    The trust certificates carried the right to receive distributions every  12  months  of  all  income  earned  by  Company-BI  from  the specified  asset  subject  to  a  maximum  rate  of  5%  p.a.    The  trust certificates would be redeemed at par on 30 September 2016.

Company-BI used the $600 million to acquire a commercial building from  Company-O  and  leased  the  building  back  to  Company-O  at $2.5 million per month  over the specified term of the ABS. Company-BI agreed to sell the building back to Company-O on 30 September 2016 for $600 million which would be used to redeem the trust certificates.    The trust would then be dissolved.

The investment returns paid or payable in the relevant periods would be expected as follows:

| Relevant Period        |   A $m |   + B $m |   - C $m |   + D $m | =   |   IR $m |
|------------------------|--------|----------|----------|----------|-----|---------|
| 1.10.2013 to 30.9.2014 |     30 |        0 |        0 |        0 | =   |      30 |
| 1.10.2013 to 30.9.2015 |     60 |        0 |        0 |        0 | =   |      60 |
| 1.10.2013 to 30.9.2016 |     90 |      600 |      600 |        0 | =   |      90 |

### Profits sharing arrangement

42. The provisions in section 7 of the Schedule  which relate  to  profits sharing arrangements are intended to cover musharaka and mudaraba structures. If an arrangement satisfies the conditions therein, it will be regarded as a profits sharing arrangement.

#### Specific features

43. In a profits sharing arrangement, the BI and the O form a business undertaking (BU). The BI contributes the bond proceeds and the  O contributes either:
(a) a sum of money or in kind or both; or
(b) expertise and management skills only.

The specified asset in the arrangement is the interest in the BU acquired by the BI with the bond proceeds.

44. The BI and the O will share the profits from the BU in accordance with the pre-agreed profits sharing ratio.    If both the BI and the O contribute capital and the BU incurs losses, they will share the losses in proportion to their capital contributions.    If the O does not contribute capital, the BI will bear the losses.
45. The profits shared by the BI may exceed the expected return payable to the BHs.    The BI may pay a portion of its share of the profits to the O as an incentive fee if the profits are greater than expected.
46. The BI must hold its interest in the BU throughout the specified term unless there is a partial redemption of the alternative bonds.    By the end of the specified term, the BI is to dispose of its interest to the O.
47. There is no restriction on the types of business activities carried on by  the  BU,  which  may  include  acquisition,  leasing  and  disposal  of  an  asset, from  or  to  the  O.    The  business  activities  may  also  include  engaging  in  a property development project, acquiring and managing the business operations of a company, etc.

#### The originator

48. The O in a profits sharing arrangement is the person who forms the BU with the BI and to whom the BI will dispose of its interest in the BU as described in section 7(1)(a) and (1)(f) of the Schedule.

#### Specified return

49. The specified return under a profits sharing arrangement means the profits  due  to  the  BI,  less  the  losses  borne  by  the  BI  as  described  in  section 7(1)(d) of the Schedule.

#### Specified asset transaction between the originator and the bond issuer

50. The specified asset transaction refers to the disposal by the BI of the specified asset, which is the interest in the BU, to the O.    If the profits sharing arrangement is a qualified IA, the specified asset transaction will be disregarded  for  profits  tax  purpose  according  to  section  22(3)(a)  of  the Schedule.

#### Asset transaction between the originator and the business undertaking

51. The asset transaction refers to any acquisition, leasing or disposal of an asset  by  the  BU  from  or  to  the  O.    It  also  covers  situations  where  the  O contributes to the BU by contribution in kind, in which case the contribution is treated  as  an  acquisition  of  an  asset  by  the  BU.    If  the  profits  sharing arrangement is a qualified IA, the asset transaction between the O and the BU will  be  disregarded  for  profits  tax  and  property  tax  purposes  according  to section 22(4)(b) of the Schedule.

#### Investment return

52. Section 10  of  the  Schedule  sets  out  the  formula  for  calculating  the investment return paid or payable in a period as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- A : the  total  amount  of  specified  return  paid  or  payable  in  the period
- B : the  specified  proceeds  of  disposal  paid  or  payable  in  the period
- C : the specified acquisition cost paid or payable in the period
- D : the total amount of any other sums paid or payable by the O to the BI in the period

- E : the total amount of any incentive fee paid or payable by the BI to the O in the period

If the proceeds of disposal are applied towards the full or partial redemption of the  alternative  bonds,  specified  proceeds  of  disposal  means  the  consideration for the disposal of the whole or part of the interest in the BU.

If the proceeds of disposal are applied towards the full or partial redemption of the  alternative  bonds,  specified  acquisition  cost  means  the  acquisition  cost attributable to the whole or part of the interest in the BU disposed of.

53. Where the BHs have an option to redeem the alternative bonds after a  certain  date  in  the  specified  term,  the  funds  for  such  early  redemption  are usually paid out of the proceeds from sale, by the BI to the O, of part of the specified asset, which is the BI's interest in the BU.    Such sale of part of the specified asset to fund an early redemption will be reflected under items B and C in the investment return formula.
54. The O will, immediately before each scheduled payment date of the alternative bonds, calculate the BI's share of profits out of which a sum is set aside to meet the additional payments to the BHs and the excess is transferred to a reserve account.    If the BI's share of profits in a period is not sufficient to cover  the  additional  payments,  a  sum  will  be  transferred  out  of  the  reserve account to meet the shortfall.    At the end of the specified term, pursuant to the BI's waiver, the O will be allowed to keep any balance in the reserve account as  an  incentive  fee.    The  incentive  fee  can  be  included  under  Item  E  and deducted from the investment return if the waiver in favour of the O is either:
(a) mandatory  and  provided  in  the  offering  document  of  the alternative bonds; or
(b) discretionary  and  provided  in  the  offering  document  of  the alternative bonds but the BI has executed, at the commencement  of  the  ABS,  an  irrevocable  waiver  of  any excessive profits.

Items D and E in section 10 are intended to cover the transfers from and to the reserve account.

55. The  following  examples  illustrate  the  working  of  the  provisions relevant  to  profits  sharing  arrangements  and  the  calculation  of  investment return under profits sharing arrangements.

**Example 13**

On 1 October 2103, Company-O and Company-BI formed BU-HK in which both had a 50% interest.    Company-O contributed a parcel of land  of  $800  million  as  capital  in  specie  whereas  Company-BI contributed  bond  proceeds  of  $800  million  as  cash  capital. They would share the profits and losses equally and Company-BI would pay  profits  in  excess  of  4%  to  Company-O  as  incentive  fees. Company-O undertook to acquire Company-BI's interest in BU-HK in two stages: $320 million for 40% on 30 September 2017 and $480 million for 60% on 30 September 2019 (i.e. the maturity date of the alternative bonds). Company-BI would use the proceeds of disposal to redeem the alternative bonds at par.

The  specified  proceeds  of  disposal  would  be:  $320  million  on  30 September  2017  and  $480  million  on  30  September  2019.    The specified acquisition costs would be: $320 million on 30 September 2017 and $480 million on 30 September 2019.

**Example 14**

On 1 January 2014, Company-BI and Company-O formed BU-HK in which  they  had  75%  and  25%  interest  respectively.    Company-BI issued $600 million of trust certificates to raise funds for its capital in BU-HK while Company-O contributed expertise and management skills. The profits sharing ratio was: Company-BI 99%; Company-O 1%. Should the specified return payable to Company-BI exceed the annual distributions, subject to a maximum rate  of  5%  per  annum,  payable  to  Companies-BH,  Company-BI would pay the excess as an incentive fee to Company-O at the end of the  specified  term.    Should  the  specified  return  fail  to  cover  the annual  distribution,  Company-O  would  withdraw  funds  from  a reserve account to cover the shortfall.

Company-BI agreed to sell  its  interest  in  BU-HK  on  31  December 2016 to Company-O at market price and use the proceeds of disposal to redeem the trust certificates.    The market price of BU-HK on 31 December  2016  was  expected  to  be  $800  million  and  the  profits generated from BU-HK during the specified term would likely be as follows:

| Relevant Period        |   Profits of BU-HK $m |   Company-BI's Specified Return $m |   Company-BI's Aggregated Return $m |
|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1.1.2014 to 31.12.2014 |                    40 |                               39.6 |                                39.6 |
| 1.1.2015 to 31.12.2015 |                    30 |                               29.7 |                                69.3 |
| 1.1.2016 to 31.12.2016 |                    40 |                               39.6 |                               108.9 |

The investment returns paid or payable in the relevant periods would be expected as follows:

| Relevant Period        |   A $m | + B $m   |   - C $m | + D $m   | - E $m   | =   |   IR $m |
|------------------------|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-----|---------|
| 1.1.2014 to 31.12.2014 |   39.6 | 0        |        0 | 0        | 9.6 (a)  | =   |      30 |
| 1.1.2014 to 31.12.2015 |   69.3 | 0        |        0 | 0.3 (b)  | 9.6      | =   |      60 |
| 1.1.2014 to 31.12.2016 |  108.9 | 600 (c)  |      600 | 0.3      | 19.2     | =   |      90 |

Notes:
- (a) $39.6m - $30m = $9.6m
- (b) $30m - $29.7m = $0.3m
- (c) $800m × 75% = $600m

### Purchase and sale arrangement

56. The provisions in section 8 of the Schedule which relate to purchase and  sale  arrangements  are  intended  to  cover  murabaha  structures.    If  an arrangement satisfies the conditions therein, it will be regarded as a purchase and sale arrangement.

#### Specific features

57. Purchase  and  sale  arrangements with fixed rate structures are

covered in section 8(2) of the Schedule whereas purchase and sale arrangements with floating rate structures are covered in section 8(3) and (4) of the Schedule.

58. In a fixed rate structure, the BI:

- (a) uses  the  bond  proceeds  to  acquire,  at  the  commencement  of the  specified  term,  an  asset  from  a  third  party,  with  the acquisition cost (i.e. purchase price) of the asset paid immediately; and
- (b) immediately  disposes  of,  on  deferred  payment  terms,  in  a lump sum or by instalments, the asset to the O at a markup to generate gains.

The  O  then  either  disposes  of  the  asset  immediately  to  another  third  party against immediate payment or retains the asset for its own use.

59. In  a  floating  rate  structure,  there  is  a  series  of  acquisitions  and disposals.    The acquisition and disposal by the BI and onward disposal of the asset by the O occur at the commencement of the specified term and on each date, except for the last date, on which an additional payment is payable under the BA in the specified ABS.    Aside from the first acquisition, the BI uses the proceeds of disposal of the asset of the preceding acquisition to make the next acquisition.    Unlike the fixed rate structure, the O in a floating rate structure will not retain the asset for its own use.
60. In  both  structures,  the  third  party  from  whom  the  BI  acquires  the asset  may  be  a  broker,  a  commodity  supplier  or  any  other  person  while  the asset  may  be  a  commodity  as  found  in  floating  rate  structures.    Section  8 would cover cases where the BI appoints the O as its buying agent or the O appoints an agent to undertake the asset or commodity transactions.    However, cases  where the  BI  acquires  an  asset  from  the  O  will  be  excluded.    Further, cases  where  the  BI  acquires  an  asset  from  an  associate  of  the  O  and  then immediately  sells  the  asset  onward  to  the  O  who  then  sells  it  back  to  that associate will not fall into this type of arrangements.    This is because of the 'another  third  party'  requirement  in  section  8(2)(c)(i)  and  8(4)(c)  of  the Schedule.

61. Under this arrangement, each asset acquired and disposed of by the BI is, from the acquisition until the disposal, the specified asset.

#### The originator

62. The O is the person to whom the BI disposes of the specified asset immediately upon its acquisition as described in section 8(2)(b) and (4)(b) of the Schedule.

63. This  is  the  markup  added  by  the  BI  to  the  acquisition  cost  of  the specified asset for disposal to the O as described in section 8(2)(b)(i) and 4(b)(i) of the Schedule.

#### Specified asset transaction between the originator and the bond issuer

64. It means the disposal or each disposal of the specified asset by the BI to  the  O  as  explained  in  section  8(6)  of  the  Schedule.    The  specified  asset transaction  will  be  disregarded  for  profits  tax  purpose  according  to  section 22(3)(a) of the Schedule if the purchase and sale arrangement is a qualified IA.

#### Investment return

65. Section 11  of  the  Schedule  sets  out  the  formula  for  calculating  the investment return paid or payable in a period as follows:

A + B

- A : (i) the markup, or part of it, paid or payable in the period in a fixed rate structure; or
- (ii) the total amount of the markups paid or payable in the period in a floating rate structure;
- B : the total amount of any other sums paid or payable by the O to the BI in the period.
66. The  markup  or  markups  are  pre-determined  at  the  start  of  the specified  ABS  or  at  the  preceding  additional  payment  dates  in  floating  rate

cases.    As  such,  the  markup  or  the  aggregate  of  markups  paid  or  payable should be equal to the bond return paid or payable.

67. The  following  examples  illustrate  the  working  of  the  provisions relevant  to  purchase  and  sale  arrangements  and  the  calculation  of  investment return under purchase and sale arrangements.

**Example 15**

On  1  April 2014, Company-BI  purchased  from  a  third  party commodity  supplier  Commodity  C  with  bond  proceeds  of  $600 million  and  sold  the  same  to  Company-O  on  spot  delivery  and deferred  payment  terms  at  a  price  of  $690  million  payable  by  an annual  instalment  of  $330  million  payable  on  31  March  2015  to 2017 inclusive. Company-O immediately sold Commodity C for $600 million on spot delivery and spot payment terms.

This is a purchase and sale arrangement with a fixed rate structure. The  markup  of  $90  million  ($690m-$600m)  represents  the  fixed rate  interest  payable  to  the  BHs  over  the  specified  term.    The acquisition and disposal by Company-BI to Company-O on deferred payment terms and the onward disposal by Company-O on immediate payment terms serve two purposes: to fix the markup for funding  the  payment  of  periodic  distribution  and  to  pass  the  funds representing  the  bond  proceeds  to  Company-O.    It  was  expected that  the  investment  returns  paid  or  payable  in  the  relevant  periods would be as follows:

| Relevant Period       |   A $m |   + B $m | =   |   IR $m |
|-----------------------|--------|----------|-----|---------|
| 1.4.2014 to 31.3.2015 |     30 |        0 | =   |      30 |
| 1.4.2014 to 31.3.2016 |     60 |        0 | =   |      60 |
| 1.4.2014 to 31.3.2017 |     90 |        0 | =   |      90 |

**Example 16**

On 1 April  2014  and  on  each  annual  distribution  date  (except  the last  one),  Company-BI  would  purchase  Commodity  D  from  a  third party commodity supplier at $600 million on spot delivery and spot

payment  terms  and  sell  the  same  on  spot  delivery  and  deferred payment  terms  at  a  price  of  $600  million  plus  a  markup  equal  to 1-year LIBOR plus 1% payable on the next annual distribution date. On each purchase, Company-O would immediately sell Commodity D to another third party for $600 million on spot delivery and spot payment terms.

This is a purchase and sale arrangement with a floating rate structure. The  markups  represent  the  floating  rates  of  interest  payable  to  the BHs  over  the  specified  term.    The  acquisition  and  disposal  by Company-BI on the  closing  date  and  on  each  periodic  distribution date (except the last one) and onward disposal by Company-O serve two  purposes:  to  fix  the  markups  for  funding  the  payments  of  the respective  periodic  distributions  and  to  pass  the  funds  representing the bond proceeds to Company-O.

Assuming the 1-year LIBOR on 1 April of 2014, 2015 and 2016 are 3%, 3.5% and 3.2% respectively, it was expected that the investment returns paid or payable in the relevant periods would be as follows:

| Relevant Period       | A $m                   | + B $m   |   = IR $m |
|-----------------------|------------------------|----------|-----------|
| 1.4.2014 to 31.3.2015 | 24.0 (a)               | 0 =      |      24   |
| 1.4.2014 to 31.3.2016 | 24.0 + 27.0 (b)        | 0 =      |      51   |
| 1.4.2014 to 31.3.2017 | 24.0 + 27.0 + 25.2 (c) | 0 =      |      76.2 |

Notes:
- (a) $600m × (3% + 1%) = $24m
- (b) $600m × (3.5% + 1%) = $27m
- (c) $600m × (3.2% + 1%) = $25.2m

### Agency arrangement

68. The provisions in section 9 of the Schedule which relate to agency arrangements  are  intended  to  cover  wakala  structures.    If  an  arrangement satisfies the conditions therein, it will be regarded as an agency arrangement.

#### Specific features

69. In an agency arrangement, the BI appoints the O as its agent while the O undertakes to:
- (a) use the bond proceeds to acquire the specified asset;
- (b) hold the specified asset until the end of the specified term;
- (c)      manage the specified asset to generate the specified return (i.e. agreed or expected return); and
- (d) dispose of the specified asset, whether or not in stages, by the end  of  the  specified  term  in  return  for  the  proceeds  of disposal.
70. The BI will receive the agreed or expected return while the O will receive an agency fee and/or an incentive fee.    In general, the income or gains generated which exceed the agreed or expected return will be retained by the O as the incentive fee.
71. The specified asset may be acquired from and sold to the O or a third party.    It  is  usually  a  portfolio  of  shares  or  pool  of  assets  which  may  be substituted or replaced during the specified term.    Whether the replaced asset constitutes the whole or part of the pre-replacement asset, the replacing asset and the remainder asset must be subject to the specified ABS until any further replacement.    Though the O undertakes to acquire, hold, manage and dispose of the asset in many cases, the BI may enter into the transaction directly as a principal where the asset is acquired from, or leased or sold to the O.
72. Though section 9(3) and (4) of the Schedule provide that management of the specified asset may include leasing, disposal and replacement, the scope of management activities can include a wide range of other  incidental  activities  such  as  managing  and  collecting  returns  from  the specified asset.    The BI may appoint other agents to perform functions similar to  those  of  paying  agent,  securities  agent,  facility  agent,  commodity  trading agent, etc.

#### The originator

73. The O is the person whom the BI appoints as its agent to invest and

manage  the  bond  proceeds  raised  under  the  BA  in  the  specified  ABS  as explained  in  section  9(1)(a)  and  (1)(b)  of  the  Schedule.    This  agency  is distinguished from those sub-agency arrangements under which a sub-agent is appointed as an investment adviser or a custodian.    Termination of the agency agreement  between  the  O  and  the  BI  will  cause  termination  of  the  specified ABS whereas termination of a sub-agency agreement will not.

#### Specified return

74. The specified return is the profits which the BI is entitled from the management  of  the  specified  asset  as  explained  in  section  9(1)(c)  of  the Schedule.

#### Specified asset transaction between the originator and the bond issuer

75. It means any acquisition, leasing or disposal of an asset as, or as part of,  the  specified  asset  by  the  BI  (whether  or  not  acting  through  the  O  as  its agent)  from  or  to  the  O  as  explained  in  section  9(7)  of  the  Schedule.    The specified asset transaction will be disregarded for profits tax and property tax purposes according to section 22(3)(a) of the Schedule if the agency arrangement is a qualified IA.

#### Investment return

76. Section 12  of  the  Schedule  sets  out  the  formula  for  calculating  the investment return paid or payable in a period as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- A : the  total  amount  of  specified  return  paid  or  payable  in  the period
- B : the total amount of any other sums paid or payable by the O to the BI in the period
- C : the  total  amount  of  agency  fee  and  incentive  fee  paid  or payable by the BI to the O in the period
77. Items B and C in section 12 are intended to cover the transfer from and to the reserve account.    They are similar to items D and E in section 10 of

the Schedule which apply to profits sharing arrangements.    The operation of the reserve account is similar to the explanations given in paragraph 54 above.

78. The  following  example  illustrates  the  working  of  the  provisions relevant to agency arrangements and the calculation of investment return under an agency arrangement.

**Example 17**

By an agency agreement, Company-BI appointed Company-O as its agent with power to invest proceeds of $600 million raised from a trust  certificate  issuance  in  a  portfolio  of  listed  shares  selected  by Company-O  in  accordance  with  specified  criteria  to  generate  a return sufficient to fund the distributions to Companies-BH payable at  4%  per  annum.    Company-BI  agreed  to  waive  any  profits  in excess of the 4% in favour of Company-O as an incentive fee at the end  of  the  specified  term.    Company-O  as  Company-BI's  agent acquired from itself a portfolio of listed shares, comprising shares in Company-L1  and  Company-L2.    After  two  years,  the  shares  in Company-L1 were sold and replaced by shares in Company-L3.

Immediately before each periodic distribution date, Company-O paid Company-BI  a  sum  equivalent  to  4%  of  the  outstanding  principal amount  of  the  trust  certificates  out  of  the  profits  derived  from  the portfolio during the year ending on the periodic distribution date and kept  the  balance  of  profits  in  a  reserve  account.        If  the  profits derived in a  particular  year  were  insufficient  to  cover  the  periodic distributions  to  Companies-BH  (i.e.  less  than  4%),  Company-O would top up the deficit out of the reserve account.

At the end the specified term, Company-O purchased from Company-BI at market price the remaining portfolio of listed shares in Company-L2 and Company-L3.    Company-BI used the proceeds of disposal to redeem the trust certificates held by Companies-BH.

In  the  trust  certificate  issuance,  Company-BI  was  the  conduit  and Company-O  was  the  borrower. Though  Company-O  sold  to Company-BI  its  portfolio  of  listed  shares  in  Company-L1  and

Company-L2, the payouts to Companies-BH from the portfolio were restricted  to  a  fixed  rate  interest  of  4%.    Company-O  retained control over the management of the portfolio and any shares in the portfolio undisposed of at the end of the arrangement were sold back to Company-O.

**Example 18**

On  1  April  2014,  Company-O  was  appointed  by  Company-BI  as agent under an agency arrangement to acquire a portfolio of shares with  proceeds  of  $600  million  raised  by  Company-BI  from  a  trust certificate  issuance  to  generate  a  return  sufficient to  fund  the distributions to Companies-BH payable at 5% per annum. Company-BI  agreed  to  pay  any  return  in  excess  of  the  annual distributions  to  Company-O  at  the  end  of  the  specified  term  as  an incentive fee.    On each annual distribution date, Company-O would pay a sum equivalent to 5% of the outstanding principal amount of the  trust  certificates  to  Company-BI  out  of  the  profits  derived  from the portfolio and keep the balance in a reserve account.    At the end of  the  specified  term,  the  balance  in  the  reserve  account  would  be paid to Company-O. Expected results from managing the portfolio of shares were as follows:

| Relevant Period/Date   | Management Activities                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 1.4.2014 to 31.3.2015  | Collected $36 million of dividends from Portfolio-1 |
| 31.3.2015              | Derived $660 million from sale of Portfolio-1       |
| 1.4.2015               | Incurred $600 million on purchase of Portfolio-2    |
| 1.4.2015 to 31.3.2016  | Collected $16 million of dividends from Portfolio-2 |
| 1.4.2016 to 31.3.2017  | Collected $18 million of dividends from Portfolio-2 |

Pursuant  to  a  purchase  and  sale  undertaking,  it  was  agreed  that Company-O would purchase Portfolio-2 from Company-BI at market price (expected to be $576 million) on 31 March 2017.

The investment returns paid or payable in the relevant periods would be expected as follows:

| Relevant Period       | A $m               | + B $m    | - C $m   | =   |   IR $m |
|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------|----------|-----|---------|
| 1.4.2014 to 31.3.2015 | 36+60 (a)          | 0         | 66 (b)   | =   |      30 |
| 1.4.2014 to 31.3.2016 | 36+60+16           | 14 (c)    | 66       | =   |      60 |
| 1.4.2014 to 31.3.2017 | 36+60+16+18-24 (d) | 14+36 (e) | 66       | =   |      90 |

Notes:
- (a) $660m - $600m = $60m

- (b) $(36 + 60)m - $600m × 5% = $66m

- (c) $600m × 5% - $16m = $14m

- (d) $600m - $576m = $24m

- (e) $600m × 5% - ($18m - $24m) = $36m

## QUALIFYING CONDITIONS FOR BOND ARRANGEMENT

79. Qualified BAs are to be regarded as debt arrangements to which the special tax treatment under section 21 of the Schedule applies.    Under section 13(1)  of  the  Schedule,  the  BA  in  a  specified  ABS  is  a  qualified  BA  if  the specified ABS always complies with the following five conditions (even if the specified IA in the scheme is not a qualified IA):

- (a) the reasonable commercial return condition;
- (b) the BA as financial liability condition;
- (c) the Hong Kong connection condition;
- (d) the maximum term length condition; and
- (e) the arrangements performed according to terms condition.

### Reasonable commercial return condition

80. The reasonable commercial return condition and the BA as financial liability condition ensure that the return from the alternative bond is economically equivalent to the return from a financial liability. The reasonable commercial return condition requires that both the 'maximum total amount of the bond return that may be payable' and the 'total amount of the bond  return  actually  paid'  in  each  period  should  not  exceed  a  reasonable commercial return.    For this purpose, a period is from the commencement of the specified term to each scheduled payment date or actual payment date on

which  the  additional  payment  or  redemption  payment  may  be  payable  or  is actually paid.

81. The 'maximum total amount of the bond return that may be payable' refers to the maximum possible amount of the bond return payable under the terms of the arrangement.    The 'total amount of the bond return actually paid' refers  to  the  bond  return  actually  paid  in  a  period,  including  exceptional not-per-terms  payments.    Both  the  bond  return  payable  and  the  bond  return actually paid must not exceed the reasonable commercial return.    Section 14(5) of  the  Schedule  provides  the  formula  for  calculating  the  bond  return  paid  or payable as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- A : the amount of the redemption payment or part of it that is paid or payable in the period
- B : the whole amount of the bond proceeds
- C : the whole amount of the redemption payment
- D : the total amount of additional payments paid or payable in the period.
82. The first part of the formula in brackets is to find out the amount of the premium or discount if there is partial or full redemption of the alternative bonds.    In  short,  the  formula  for  the  bond  return  is:  redemption  payment  bond proceeds + coupon payments.

**Example 19**

An alternative bond of par value $100,000 with a 2 year tenor was issued at $98,000 and was redeemed at par.    The holder received 4 half-yearly payments of $1,000 each.

The bond return to the holder at the end of the specified term = $100,000 - $98,000 + 4 × $1,000 = $6,000.

If the bonds were redeemed in two equal instalments, the bond return to the holder at the end of first year

- = $50,000 - ($98,000 × $50,000/$100,000) + 2 × $1,000
- = $3,000.

83. The  reasonable  commercial  return  is  not  an  arbitrary  return  set  to restrict the number of BAs that could be qualified for the special tax treatment. Nor  is  it  used  to  discriminate  any  BA  offering  higher  return  to  its  holders because of its potential risks of default. In applying the reasonable commercial  return  test, the alternative  bonds  should  be  compared  to  a hypothetical  loan  on  similar  terms  and  carrying  similar  risks.    The  return applicable to each case varies depending on the market condition at the time of issue, the terms of the bonds (e.g. exchangeable bonds normally carry a lower rate of return) and the credit rating of the O.
84. In  general,  investment  in  alternative  bonds  will  carry  a  slightly greater risk than investment in conventional debt securities. The BHs have an indirect  recourse  only  to  the  purchase  undertaking  executed  by  the  O  and cannot sue the BI for return of the capital sum.    The reasonable commercial return for alternative bonds is likely to be higher compared with conventional debt securities.
85. As  with  any  financial  instrument,  the  pricing  of  alternative  bonds will depend on the O's view of the market at the time of issue and 'reasonable commercial  return'  may  vary  within  a  range.    The  purpose  of  the  test  is  to exclude cases where:
- (a) the issue terms of the alternative bonds impose no upper limit on the amount of additional payments;
- (b) the additional payments and redemption payment are linked to profits (e.g. equity instruments); or
- (c) the fixed rate or the margin is blatantly above what would be reasonable  and  commercial  for  a  debt  security  on  similar terms carrying similar risks.

These cases indicate that the alternative bonds are not debt-like instruments.

86. The Commissioner will treat the condition as having been met if:
- (a) the fixed rate or benchmarked rate of the alternative bonds is comparable  to  the  interest  rate  of  a  loan  on  similar  terms carrying similar risks; and
- (b) the redemption and additional payments are made to the BHs according to the terms.

For issuances with step-down additional payments, if the interest rates in earlier periods fall within a reasonable range, the condition may also be accepted as having been met.

### BA as financial liability condition

87. This condition requires that the BA:
- (a) is treated as a financial liability of the BI in accordance with the Hong Kong or the international accounting standards; or
- (b) would  be  treated  as  a  financial  liability  of  the  BI  if  the  BI applied the Hong  Kong  or  the international accounting standards.
88. The term 'financial liability' is defined in International Accounting Standard 32 as well as Hong Kong Accounting Standard 32.    This definition includes  a  contractual  obligation  to  deliver  cash  or  another  financial  asset  to another entity. As  alternative bonds  issued under  a qualified  BA  are functionally  equivalent  to  debt  securities,  the  BI  should  prepare  accounts according  to  their  economic  substance  and  recognise  the  BA  as  a  financial liability if it adopts the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS) or the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
89. There  may  be  cases  where  the  BI  uses  other  reporting  standards because  of  the  requirement  imposed  by  its  country  of  incorporation  or constitution.    The condition will also be treated as having been satisfied if the BI seeks an accounting opinion confirming that the BA in the specified ABS would be treated as a financial liability according to either the HKFRS or the IFRS.
90. An  alternative  bond  which  is  exchangeable  for  shares  would  be treated as a hybrid instrument (i.e. a host contract plus an embedded derivative) for accounting purposes.    Provided that the host contract represents a financial liability,  the  alternative bond will be partly treated as a financial liability and will thus satisfy the financial liability condition.

### Hong Kong connection condition

91. The  Hong  Kong  connection  condition  ensures  that  the  alternative bonds eligible for debt treatment will have the requisite degree of nexus with Hong Kong in a way that it would help promote the Hong Kong sukuk platform. A  specified  ABS  complies  with  the  Hong  Kong  connection  condition  if alternative bonds issued under the BA in the scheme:
- (a) are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange;
- (b) are  issued  in  good  faith  and  in  the  course  of  carrying  on business in Hong Kong;
- (c) are marketed in Hong Kong; or
- (d) are  lodged  with  and  cleared  by  the  Central  Moneymarkets Unit of the Monetary Authority.
92. Where the alternative bonds are listed, it is expected that the listing status would be maintained throughout the specified term of the specified ABS. Where the alternative bonds are not listed, the condition is also satisfied if the alternative  bonds  are  lodged  with  and  cleared  by  the  Central  Moneymarkets Unit.    Where the alternative bonds are neither listed nor cleared by the Central Moneymarkets Unit, the condition is also satisfied if they are marketed in Hong Kong or issued in the course of carrying on business in Hong Kong.
93. The word 'marketed' usually carries the  meaning of 'to advertise, promote and offer for sale'.    Where it is claimed that the alternative bonds are marketed in Hong Kong, genuine actions or activities should be undertaken to market the alternative bonds in Hong Kong by way of:
- (a) conducting promotional activities such as advertising; and
- (b) making  an  offer  for  sale  such  as  issuing  or  distributing offering documents.

While facts and circumstances of each case will be considered in its totality, promotional activities alone may not be sufficient to satisfy this condition.

### Maximum term length condition

94. The maximum term length condition requires that the specified term

of the specified ABS must not exceed 15 years.    In other words, any delay of the disposal of the specified asset, even allowed under sections 18(2) or 28(2) of  the  Schedule,  must  not cause the specified term to exceed 15  years.    The condition effectively limits the tenor of ABSs to 15 years.

### Arrangements performed according to terms condition

95. The  arrangements  performed  according  to  terms  condition  ensures that the actual performance of the BA and the specified IA during the specified term accords with the terms of the arrangements so as to prevent any abuse by delaying the disposal of the specified asset to an infinite period.    A specified ABS complies with this condition if the BA and specified IA in the scheme are performed according to the terms of the arrangements as described in section 2 and sections 6 to 12 of the Schedule.
96. Section 18(2) of the Schedule allows a 30-day delay in disposing of the  specified  asset  without  breaching  the  condition.    Under  section  28(2)  of the Schedule, the Commissioner may, when the other qualifying conditions are met,  disregard  a  delay  of  more  than  30  days  if  he  is  satisfied  that  there  is  a reasonable excuse.

**Example 20**

Company-BI  issued  alternative  bonds  with  a  specified  term  of  12 years.    As  a  result  of  liquidity  problem,  Company-O  unilaterally delayed the purchase of the specified asset from Company-BI at the end of the specified term for 28 days.

The condition would be treated as satisfied under section 18(2) of the Schedule.    If the purchase was delayed for three months, section 28 of the Schedule would allow the Commissioner to treat the condition as  having  been  satisfied.    If  the  tenor  of  the  alternative  bonds  had been 15 years, the 'maximum term length condition' would not have been complied with.

**Example 21**

The specified asset of a 12-year agency arrangement was a

substantial  holding  in  the  share  capital  of  a  company  listed  in Country-F1. Upon redemption of the alternative bonds, Company-BI sold the holding to a buyer in Country-F2.    The sale was blocked by the government of Country-F1 but was approved one year later.

The Commissioner may accept there is a reasonable excuse for the delay  and  treat  the  condition  as  having  been  satisfied  according  to section 28(2) of the Schedule.

97. Where the O is insolvent and fails to purchase the specified asset as stipulated in the purchase undertaking, the specified ABS may be terminated as a result.    Termination may also arise where there is a total loss of the specified asset.    In  such  circumstances,  the  Commissioner  may  treat  the  condition  as having been satisfied.

## QUALIFYING CONDITIONS FOR SPECIFIED INVESTMENT ARRANGEMENT

98. Qualified IAs are to be regarded as debt arrangements to which the special tax treatment under section 22 of the Schedule applies.    Under section 13(2) of the Schedule, the specified IA in a specified ABS is a qualified IA if the BA in the specified ABS has always been a qualified BA (i.e. the BA is economically equivalent to a debt arrangement and has complied with the five conditions)  and  the  specified  ABS  always  complies  with  the  following  two conditions:

- (a) the BI as conduit condition; and
- (b) the IA as financial liability condition.

### BI as conduit condition

99. The condition requires that both the 'maximum total amount of the investment return that may be payable' and the 'total amount of the investment return  actually  paid'  to  the  BI  in  a  period  must  not  exceed  respectively  the 'maximum total amount of the bond return that may be payable' and the 'total amount of the bond return actually paid' to the BHs in the same period.    For

this purpose, a period is from the commencement of the specified term to each scheduled payment date or actual payment date.

100. To  determine  whether  the  condition  is  met,  the  investment  return paid or payable under the specified IA in a period will be compared with the bond return paid or payable under the BA in the specified ABS in that period. If  the  investment  return  paid  or  payable  exceeds  the  bond  return  paid  or payable, the condition is not met and the specified IA is not a qualified IA since it  is  not  economically  equivalent  to  a  debt  arrangement.    In  general,  the investment return paid or payable should not be less than the bond return paid or  payable  since  top-up  payments  will  be  made  out  of  a  reserve  account  or pre-arranged liquidity facilities.    In case  the O is insolvent, any reduction of the  investment  return  payments  will  reduce  correspondingly  the  bond  return payments.    Therefore, the investment return payments should not be less than the bond return payments.

**Example 22**

On 1 October 2013, Company-BI issued $600 million trust certificates  with  a  3-year  term  under  an  ABS  at  a  discount  of  1%. The  trust  certificates  would  be  redeemed  at  par  by  two  equal instalments  of  $300  million  on  30  September  2015  and  2016 respectively.    The  trust  certificates  carried  the  right  to  receive distributions every 12 months of all income earned by Company-BI from the specified asset subject to a maximum rate of 5% p.a.

Company-BI  used  the  bond  proceeds  to  acquire  from  Company-O two  commercial  buildings,  Building-1  and  Building-2,  which  were leased back to Company-O each at a monthly rent of $1.25 million. Company-O agreed to buy back Building-1 on 30 September 2015 at $300  million  which  would  be  used  to  redeem  half  of  the  trust certificates.    On  30  September  2016,  Company-O  would  buy  back Building-2  at  $300  million  which  would  be  used  to  redeem  the remaining trust certificates.    The trust would then be dissolved.

The investment returns paid or payable in the relevant periods would be expected as follows:

| Relevant Period        | A $m   |   + B $m | - C $m   |   + D $m | =   |   IR $m |
|------------------------|--------|----------|----------|----------|-----|---------|
| 1.10.2013 to 30.9.2014 | 30 (a) |        0 | 0        |        0 | =   |      30 |
| 1.10.2013 to 30.9.2015 | 60     |      300 | 297 (b)  |        0 | =   |      63 |
| 1.10.2013 to 30.9.2016 | 75     |      600 | 594 (c)  |        0 | =   |      81 |

Notes:
- (a) $1.25m × 12 × 2 = $30m
- (b) $300m × 99% = $297m
- (c) $300m × 99% + $300m × 99% = $594m

Comparison of the investment return paid or payable and the bond return paid or payable for the same period would be as follows:

| Relevant Period        |   IR $m | BR (a) $m   |
|------------------------|---------|-------------|
| 1.10.2013 to 30.9.2014 |      30 | 30 (b)      |
| 1.10.2013 to 30.9.2015 |      63 | 63 (c)      |
| 1.10.2013 to 30.9.2016 |      81 | 81 (d)      |

Notes:
- (a)   BR = (A - (B × A / C)) + D (i.e. redemption payment (full or part) - bond proceeds (full or part) + additional payments)
- (b)   $0 + $30m = $30m
- (c)   ($300m - $297m) + 2 × $30m = $63m
- (d)   ($600m - $594m) + (2 × $30m) + (1 × $15m) = $81m

Both the investment return and bond return are paid according to the terms of the arrangements.    The BI as conduit condition is  met as the  'maximum  total  amount  of  the  investment  return  that  may  be payable' and the 'total amount of the investment return actually paid' to  Company-BI  in  a  period  would  not  exceed  respectively  the 'maximum total amount of the bond return that may be payable' and the 'total amount of the bond return actually paid' to the BHs in the same period.

### IA as financial liability condition

101. This condition requires that the specified IA:
- (a) is  treated  as  a  financial  liability  of  the  O  in  accordance with the Hong Kong or the international accounting standards; or
- (b) would  be  treated  as  a  financial  liability  of  the  O  if  the  O applied the Hong  Kong  or  the international accounting standards.
102. If  the  BA  of  a  specified  ABS  is  a  qualified  BA  and  the  BI  merely acts as a conduit in the scheme, the O should account for the substance of the scheme and recognize the IA in the specified ABS as a financial liability if it adopts the HKFRS or the IFRS.
103. There  may  be  cases  where  the  O  uses  other  reporting  standards because  of  the  requirement  imposed  by  its  country  of  incorporation  or constitution.    The  condition  will  be  treated  as  having  been  satisfied  if  the  O seeks an accounting opinion confirming that the IA in the specified ABS would be treated as a financial liability according to either the HKFRS or the IFRS.

## QUALIFIED BOND ARRANGEMENT AS DEBT ARRANGEMENT

### Special tax treatment for qualified BA

104. Section 21 of the Schedule set out, for the purposes of the IRO, the special tax treatment for a qualified BA.    The qualified BA is regarded as a debt arrangement and -

- (a) the bond proceeds are regarded as money borrowed by the BI from the BHs;
- (b) the  additional  payments  are  regarded  as  interest  payable  on the money borrowed by the BI from the BHs ;
- (c) the BI is regarded as not being a trustee of the specified asset;
- (d) the  BHs  are  regarded  as  not  having  any  legal  or  beneficial interest in the specified asset;
- (e) if  the  rights  in  the  alternative  bonds  are  transferrable  by delivery, the concessionary tax rate under section 14A or the exemption under section 26A of the IRO will apply provided that the conditions stipulated for the concession or exemption are satisfied;
- (f) if  the  rights  in  the  alternative  bonds  are  transferrable  by delivery, the alternative bonds are regarded as certificates of deposit for the purposes of section 15(1)(j), (k) and (l) of the IRO, and the making of redemption payment for the alternative bonds is regarded as the redemption on maturity or presentment of certificates of deposit;
- (g) the additional payments are accorded the same tax treatment under  section  16(2)(f)  of  the  IRO  as  interest  payable  on conventional bonds;
- (h) the  alternative  bonds  are  regarded  as  'bonds'  within  the definition  of  'securities'  for  the  purposes  of  section  20AC and item 1 of Schedule 16 of the IRO; and
- (i) the qualified BA is not regarded as a mutual fund, unit trust or similar investment scheme for the purposes of section 26A of the IRO.

## QUALIFIED INVESTMENT ARRANGEMENT AS DEBT ARRANGEMENT

### Special tax treatment for qualified IA

105. Section 22 of the Schedule set out, for the purposes of the IRO, the special  tax  treatment  for  a  qualified  IA.      The  qualified  IA  is  regarded  as  a debt arrangement and -

- (a) the acquisition cost of the specified asset, which is funded by the  bond  proceeds  from  the  BA,  is  regarded  as  money borrowed by the O from the BI;
- (b) the investment return payable is regarded as interest payable on the money borrowed by the O from the BI;
- (c) the  BI  is  regarded  as  not  having  any  legal  or  beneficial interest in the specified asset;
- (d) any 'specified asset transaction between O  and BI' is disregarded;
- (e) the  specified  asset,  or  part  of  it,  acquired  by  the  BI  from  a third party is regarded as acquired by the O directly from the third party;
- (f) the  specified  asset,  or  part  of  it,  disposed  of  by  the  BI  to  a third party is regarded as disposed of by the O directly to the third party;
- (g) the income, expenditure, profits, gains or losses arising from the specified asset are regarded as those of the O;
- (h) the investment return, though constituting consideration payable for the right of use of land or buildings, is regarded as not being consideration for the purposes of section 5B of the IRO; and
- (i) the alternative bonds are regarded as debentures or instruments and the BI is treated as an associated corporation of the O for the purpose of section 16(2)(f)(iii) of the IRO.

In an issuance programme of alternative bonds, the BI will not be regarded as an  associated  corporation  of  the  O  if  not  all  ABSs  are  or  are  intended  to  be specified ABSs, or if not all specified ABSs comply or are intended to comply with  the  reasonable  commercial  return  condition  and  the  BI  as  conduit condition.

106. Where the qualified IA involves an interest in a BU as the specified asset, then for the purposes of the IRO -

- (a) the  BU  and  any  acquisition  or  disposal  of  an  interest  in  the BU are disregarded;
- (b) any 'asset transaction between O and BU' is disregarded;
- (c) any asset acquired by the BU from a third party is regarded as acquired directly by the O from that third party;
- (d) any asset disposed of by the BU to a third party is regarded as disposed of directly by the O to that third party;
- (e) any other business activities carried on by the BU during the specified term are regarded as business activities carried on by the O directly; and

- (f) the income, expenditure, profits, gains or losses arising from an asset held by, or other business activities carried on by the BU are regarded as those of the O.

**Example 23**

Continue  with the case in Example  14. The  profits sharing arrangement  was  expected  to  meet  the  seven  conditions  in  section 13(1) and (2).

Since  the  profits  sharing  arrangement  is  a  qualified  IA,  it  will  be regarded as a debt arrangement under section 22(2) of the Schedule and -

- (a) the  sum  of  $600  million  is  regarded  as  money  borrowed  by Company-O from Company-BI according to section 22(2)(a) of the Schedule;
- (b) the  investment  return  of  $30  million  is  regarded  as  interest paid  by  Company-O  to  Company-BI  for  each  of  the  years ended  31.12.2014,  31.12.2015  and  31.12.2016  according  to section 22(2)(b) of the Schedule;
- (c) the  contribution  of  $600  million  by  Company-BI  to  the BU-HK  as  capital  and the  disposal  by  Company-BI  to Company-O of its interest in the BU-HK at $600 million on 31.12.2006 are disregarded according to section 22(4)(a); and
- (d) the  profits  of  $40  million,  $30  million  and  $40  million generated  from  BU-HK  for  the  years  ended  31.12.2014, 31.12.2015 and 31.12.2016 respectively are regarded as profits  of  Company-O  according  to  section  22(4)(f)  of  the Schedule.
107. Under the special tax treatment, the additional payments in a BA as well as the investment return in an IA are treated as interest payable by the BI to the BHs and the O to the BI respectively.    The taxability and deductibility of such additional payments as well as the investment return will be subject to the  same  provisions  in  the  IRO  applicable  to  interest  income/expenditure. Details  of  the  tax  treatment  can  be  found  in  Departmental  Interpretation  and Practice Notes No. 13 (Profits Tax -Taxation of Interest Received),

Departmental  Interpretation  and  Practice  Notes  No.  13A  (Profits  Tax  Deductibility of Interest Expense) and Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 21 (Locality of Profits).

## DISQUALIFICATION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SPECIAL TAX TREATMENT

### Non-qualifying transactions

108. The special tax treatment accorded to a qualified BA or a qualified IA  is  a  conditional  tax  treatment.    If  the  IA  or  BA  eventually  falls  short  of complying with the qualifying conditions and is not to be regarded as a debt arrangement, the nature of transactions involved will be determined after taking into account their substance and legal form.
109. Section 13(3) of the Schedule provides that an arrangement is to be regarded  as  never  having  been  a  qualified  BA  on  the  occurrence  of  a  'BA disqualifying event' at any time during the specified term.    Similarly, section 13(4) of the Schedule provides that an arrangement is to be regarded as never having been a qualified IA on the occurrence of an 'IA disqualifying event' at any time during the specified term.

### Retrospective effect

110. The consequences are that the special tax treatment under sections 21 or 22 of the Schedule  applied to an arrangement  is to  be  withdrawn retrospectively  from  the  commencement  of  the  specified  term.    That  would mean the tax liabilities of the BI or the O for all relevant years of assessment have to be re-computed, and additional assessments, assessments or reassessments are to be issued.

### Disqualifying events

111. A 'BA disqualifying  event',  as  defined  under  section  13(5)  of  the Schedule, means:
- (a) the  ABS  is  not  a  specified  ABS  at  any  time  during  the specified term; or
- (b) the  specified  ABS  fails  to  comply  with  any  of  the  five qualifying conditions for a BA  at  any  time  during  the specified term.
112. An 'IA disqualifying event', as defined under section 13(5) of the Schedule, means:
- (a) the  ABS  is  not  a  specified  ABS  at  any  time  during  the specified term;
- (b) the  specified  ABS  fails  to  comply  with  any  of  the  five qualifying conditions for a BA  at  any  time  during  the specified  term  (i.e.  the  BA  in  the  specified  ABS  is  not  a qualified BA); or
- (c) the  specified  ABS  fails  to  comply  with  any  of  the  two qualifying conditions for a specified IA at any time during the specified term.

That is to say, in the event that a BA in a specified ABS is disqualified, the IA in the specified ABS is also disqualified.    This is, however, not vice versa.

**Example 24**

In a specified ABS, although the BI as conduit condition and the IA as financial liability condition were satisfied, the reasonable commercial return condition was not complied with.

The  specified  ABS's  failure  to  meet  the  reasonable  commercial return condition rendered the BA not a qualified BA and the IA not a qualified IA.

**Example 25**

In a specified ABS, the BI as conduit condition was failed near the end of the term.    It, however, met all other conditions throughout.

The  specified  ABS's  failure  to  meet  the  BI  as  conduit  condition rendered the specified IA not a qualified IA.    However, this did not affect the status of the BA which remained to be a qualified BA.

**Example 26**

In  a  specified  ABS,  99%  of  the  alternative  bonds  issued  were subscribed  by  one  BH.    The  IA  of  the  ABS  was  a  profits  sharing arrangement. The ABS complied with the seven qualifying conditions.    Therefore,  its  BA  and  IA  had  been  regarded  as  a qualified  BA  and  a  qualified  IA  respectively.    At  the  end  of  the specified  term,  the  BI,  instead  of  waiving  the  excessive  profits  in favour of the O according to the terms of the scheme, distributed all excessive profits to the BHs.

Two  BA  disqualifying  events  occurred.    The  scheme  failed  to comply  with  the  reasonable  commercial  return  condition  and  the arrangements performed according to terms condition.    Both the BA and the IA are to be regarded as never having been a qualified BA and never having been a qualified IA respectively.    The special tax treatment accorded to them would be revoked.

113. Section  28(2)  of  the  Schedule  empowers  the  Commissioner  to disregard a delay of more than 30 days in disposing of the specified asset where there  is  a  reasonable  excuse  in  relation  to  the  'arrangements  performed according  to  terms'  condition.    Apart  from  that,  the  Amendment  Ordinance does  not  provide  for  any  other  remedies  for  non-compliance.    Once  a disqualifying  event  occurs,  the  disqualification  is  retrospective.    The  BA  or the IA in the specified ABS will remain an unqualified BA or IA even if the scheme complies with the specified conditions later and throughout the rest of the specified term.

## OBLIGATION TO INFORM DISQUALIFYING EVENT

### Informing the Commissioner in writing

114. Generally, the obligation is on the BI for a BA, and on the BI or the O for an IA.    They are required, under section 26 of the Schedule, to notify the Commissioner in writing of a disqualifying event within 30 days.    Failure to notify a BA disqualifying event or an IA disqualifying event will be treated as a failure to comply with section 51(2) of the IRO and will entail penalties under sections 80 or 82A of the IRO.

115. However, notification will not be required if:
(a) the  assessment  or  assessments  for  any  year  of  assessment, made  on  the  basis  that  the  claim  that  the  BA  or  IA  is  a qualified  BA  or  IA  is  not  accepted,  have  become  final  and conclusive under section 70 of the IRO;
(b) the  specified  assessment  or  assessments  for  any  year  of assessment, made  on the basis that the BA  or IA is disqualified  because  of  an  earlier  disqualifying  event,  have become final and conclusive under section 70 of the IRO.

#### RECORD KEEPING AND LIMITATION PERIODS

#### Sections 51C and 51D

116. Section  51C(1)  of  the  IRO  requires  that  business  records  must  be kept for a period of not less than 7 years after the completion of the transactions, acts or operations to which they relate.    Section 51D(1) of the IRO has similar requirement  for  rental  records.    These  provisions  ensure  that  the  records relevant to the tax return must be kept until the period of limitation for raising tax assessment runs out (i.e. the 6-year period under section 60 of the IRO).
117. The tax regime for ABS allows alternative bonds to have a specified term up to 15 years.    Revocation of the special tax treatment is retrospective from  the  commencement  of  the  specified  term.    To  align  with  the  specified term, section 25 of the Schedule modifies section 51C of the IRO by requiring the BI and the O to retain records in respect of the specified ABS to the later of :
- (a) the expiry of 7 years after the completion of the transactions, acts or operations to which they relate; or
- (b) the expiry of 3 years after the end of the specified term of the scheme.

Failure to do so will be treated as a failure to comply with section 51C and will entail penalties under section 80 of the IRO.

118. However, the modified record-keeping period ceases to apply if:
- (a) the  assessment  or  assessments  for  any  year  of  assessment, made  on  the  basis  that  the  claim  that  the  BA  or  IA  is  a qualified  BA  or  IA  is  not  accepted,  have  become  final  and conclusive under section 70 of the IRO;
- (b) the  specified  assessment  or  assessments  for  any  year  of assessment, made  on the basis that the BA  or IA is disqualified, have become final and conclusive under section 70 of the IRO.

#### Section 60

119. To align with the specified term which is up to 15 years, section 27(3) of  the  Schedule  modifies  section  60  of  the  IRO  by  allowing  the  limitation periods to run after the expiry of the year of disqualification of a BA/IA if that year falls after the year of assessment.

#### Section 79

120. Similarly, section 79 is modified by section 27(5) of the Schedule to extend the time period for refund in case of disqualification.    The period of six years is to run after the expiry of the year of disqualification if that year falls after the year of assessment.

**Example 27**

The lease arrangement in a qualified IA had a specified term of 10 years  from  2014/15  to  2023/24.    Special  tax  treatment  under sections 21 and 22 would be granted to both the BA and the IA for years 2014/15 to 2023/24.

Should a BA disqualifying event occur in 2018/19, both the BA and IA  would  be  disqualified  and  the  special  tax  treatment  would  be withdrawn retrospectively from 2014/15. Assessments and additional assessments in respect of years 2014/15 to 2017/18 would be  raised  on  the  BI  before  the  end  of  2024/25.    Assessments  and additional assessments in respect of years 2018/19 to 2024/25 would

be raised on the BI before the end of six years after the end of the year of assessment.    The additional payments to the BHs might be considered as dividends not subject to profits tax under section 26 of the IRO.    The limitation period for any refunds to the BH, if any, in respect of years 2014/15 to 2017/18 would be extended to the end of 2024/25 whereas the limitation period for any refunds to the BH, if any, in respect of years 2018/19 to 2023/24 would be six years after the end of the year of assessment.

## OBJECTIONS AND APPEALS

### Objections to all specified assessments

121. The provisions in the IRO relating to a notice of assessment, appeal and other proceedings apply to specified assessments and any tax charged made under the modified section 60 or 79 of the IRO.    However, section 27(8) of the  Schedule  provides  that  where  the  BI  or  the  O  objects  to  a  specified assessment for any year of assessment, disputing the disqualification of the BA or IA, the objection is treated as objections to all specified assessments made for all years of assessment because of that disqualification.

## ADVANCE RULINGS

### Application and required information

122. Generally, where a person intends to enter into a specified ABS as the O and claims that the specified IA is a qualified IA, the person may make an application for an advance ruling.    The Commissioner requires maximum disclosure in connection with requests for advance rulings.    The request for an advance  ruling  must  contain  the  information  and  documents  as  listed  in paragraph  19  of  Departmental  Interpretation  and  Practice  Notes  No.  31 (Advance Rulings).    The information of the specified ABS and details of each type of specified IA required to be provided are set out in the Appendix.
123. Requests  for  an  advance  ruling  should  be  made  well  ahead  of  the closing date of the contemplated specified ABS.    To process an application, a

minimum  period  of  8  weeks  will  generally  be  required.    However,  the Commissioner  will  not  be  bound  by  such  period  if  the  application  does  not contain all material information required for its processing.

## LOANS (AMENDMENT) ORDINANCE 2014

### Government bond programme

124. The  Loans  (Amendment)  Ordinance  2014  has  amended  section 26A(1)(c) of the IRO to allow additional payments and disposal gains derived from  any  alternative  bonds  issued  in  connection  with  the  Government  Bond Programme to enjoy the same profits tax exemption as that currently applicable to the interest payments  and  disposal  gains  in  relation to  conventional Government  Bonds.    That  is,  profits  of  any  corporation  or  other  person chargeable to profits tax shall not include:
(a) additional  payments  paid  or  payable  on  an  alternative  bond issued  in  connection  with  a  borrowing  by  the  Government within the meaning of section 2A(2) of the Loans Ordinance; and
(b)      any profit on the sale or other disposal of, or on the receipt of redemption payment for, such an alternative bond.

## DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENTS

### Interest article

125. Under  sections  21  and  22  of  the  Schedule,  the  qualified  BA  and qualified IA in a specified ABS are regarded as debt arrangements though their legal form may not be a loan.    Thus, the definition of 'interest' in the Interest Article of Double Taxation Agreements entered into by Hong Kong should be applicable to additional payments and investment return made under qualified BAs and qualified IAs.
