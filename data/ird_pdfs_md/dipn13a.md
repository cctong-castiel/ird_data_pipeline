## INTRODUCTION

Interest  expense,  insofar  as  it  is  incurred  in  the  production  of  the chargeable profits of a person, is deductible from the assessable profits of the person.    With  the  gradual  removal  of  interest  tax  in  the  1980's  and  the limitation  in  taxing  offshore  interest  income  earned  by  a  person  carrying  on business in  Hong  Kong, the  taxation scheme on interest  receipts and interest payments  have  become  asymmetrical,  in  that  interest  income  is  not  taxable while  interest  expenses  are  tax  deductible.    Recognising  the  risk  of  revenue loss that might be caused by tax avoidance schemes that would take advantage of  the  lack  of  symmetry  in  tax  treatment  on  interest,  specific  rules  were introduced in 1984 and 1986 to restrict the deduction of interest under certain circumstances. The interest deduction scheme has been revamped substantially  by  the  recent  amendments  introduced  by  the  Inland  Revenue (Amendment) Ordinance 2004 (the 2004 Amendment Ordinance), with a view to bolstering up the interest deduction rules.    This Interpretation and Practice Note sets  out  the  Department's  views  and  practices  on  the  interest  deduction scheme that applies before and after the commencement  of  the 2004 Amendment Ordinance,  which  came  into  operation  on  25  June  2004. [The practices of the interest deduction scheme that applied before the commencement of 2004 Amendment Ordinance were previously included in the DIPN No. 13.]

## INTEREST DEDUCTION SCHEME BEFORE  THE  COMMENCEMENT  OF  THE  2004  AMENDMENT ORDINANCE

2. Following the abolition of interest tax, anti-avoidance measures were enacted in relation to interest deductions under profits tax to protect the profits tax  yield.    In  addition  to  the  interest  being  incurred  in  the  production  of chargeable  profits,  specific  conditions  must  also  be  satisfied  before  interest expenses could be allowed as deductions in computing assessable profits.    In practice, these measures required all claims for deductions in respect of interest payable on moneys borrowed for the purpose of producing assessable profits to be  supported  by  sufficient  details  and/or  documentary  evidence  to  satisfy  at least one of the six prescribed conditions in section 16(2)(a) to (f). [Sections of  the  Main  Ordinance  referred  to  in  paragraphs  2  -  9  are  those  provisions

that were in force before  the  commencement  of  the  2004  Amendment Ordinance.]

### Conditions for Deduction

3. Conditions (a) and (b) were largely self-explanatory and referred to borrower  taxpayers  who  were  financial  institutions  or  public  utilities.    All borrowings by a financial institution satisfied condition (a), while any borrowings by public utilities at a rate of interest not exceeding a specified rate satisfied condition (b).
4. Condition  (c) applied to borrowings  from  persons  other  than financial  institutions  or  overseas  financial  institutions.    It  would  be  satisfied by  the  borrower  establishing  that  any  interest  payable  on  the  loan  was chargeable to profits tax under the Inland Revenue Ordinance (IRO).    Where the money borrowed had been made available to the borrower in Hong Kong, it would generally be clear that any interest paid on the loan would be chargeable to profits tax in the hands of the lender who was carrying on a trade or business in  Hong  Kong,  as  the  interest  income  was  sourced  in  Hong  Kong.    In  such cases, to demonstrate that condition (c) was satisfied, it would be sufficient to disclose  the  identity  of  the  lender,  the  place  of  his  business,  and  the  place where  the  money  borrowed  was  made  available  to  the  borrower,  so  as  to establish  that  the  interest  paid  was  chargeable  to  profits  tax.    On  the  other hand,  where  the  loan  was  made  available  to  the  borrower  outside  of  Hong Kong as an offshore loan, there would be a prima facie presumption that any interest  payable  was  not  chargeable  to  profits  tax  (for  being  incurred  outside Hong Kong)) and that condition (c) was not satisfied.    This presumption could, of course, be rebutted by the borrower demonstrating that notwithstanding the loan being offshore, the lender nevertheless carried on business in Hong Kong and was chargeable to profits tax on the interest received.
5. Condition (d) referred to moneys borrowed from financial institutions  or  overseas  financial  institutions.    Its  practical  application  was best explained by distinguishing such borrowings into those that satisfied the condition and those that did not.    A loan from a financial institution (whether local or overseas) would satisfy condition (d) if -

- The loan was not secured or guaranteed by any deposit made with that or another financial institution; or
- The  loan  was  secured  or  guaranteed  against  a  deposit  with that or another financial institution, by -
    - the borrower or on his behalf, or,
    - a person who was closely associated with the borrower (an associate as defined in section 16(3)), and the interest received on the deposit was subject to profits tax.

Where a loan from a financial institution was secured or guaranteed against a deposit with that or another financial institution and the interest received on the deposit was not chargeable to tax in Hong Kong, condition (d) would not be satisfied.

The following examples illustrate the above situations -

**Example 1**

Mr A carried on business as a plastics manufacturer.    In  order  to obtain  additional  working  capital,  he  borrowed  from  a  local  bank. This borrowing was secured by a mortgage over the factory premises owned by Mr A.

Because the loan was not secured by a deposit, the borrowing clearly satisfied condition (d).

**Example 2**

Mr B carried on an export/import business in Hong Kong.    In order to obtain additional working capital, he borrowed from a local bank. The borrowing was secured by a fixed deposit with that same bank registered in the name of Mr B's wife, who carried on no business in Hong Kong.

The interest received by Mrs B was not chargeable to tax in Hong Kong and as the relationship between Mr and Mrs B (as husband and wife) was one within the class of 'associates' prescribed in section 16(3), the borrowing by Mr B did not satisfy condition (d).

**Example 3**

C  Limited  carried  on  business  in  Hong  Kong  as  an  electronics manufacturer. For the purpose of acquiring new factory premises, C Limited borrowed from a local bank. This borrowing was partly secured by a fixed deposit with the same bank registered in the name of  D  Limited,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  C  Limited.    D  Ltd carried on business in Hong Kong.

Although the borrowing was secured against a deposit owned by an 'associated  corporation',  condition  (d)  was  satisfied  because  the interest on the deposit was chargeable to profits tax in the hands of D Limited.

**Example 4**

E Limited carried on business in Hong Kong as consultants. Mr E, who was the major shareholder and managing director of E Limited, received  dividends  and  a  salary  from  the  company. For  the purposes of expanding its business, E Limited borrowed from a local bank. This borrowing was secured by a fixed deposit in the name of Mr E with a Cayman Islands financial institution.

Being  both  a  shareholder  and  a  director  of E  Limited,  Mr  E  was related to E Limited as an associate within the terms of section 16(3). As Hong Kong tax was not chargeable on interest received by Mr E from the Cayman Islands deposit, the borrowing by E  Limited  did not satisfy condition (d).

6. In practice, the  most appropriate way of establishing that condition (d)  was  satisfied  was  for  the  taxpayer  to  submit  a  statement  with  his  return setting out details of both the borrowing and the security or guarantee provided for  the  loan.    Where  the  security  or  guarantee  took  the  form  of  a  deposit

owned  by a  person  other  than  the  borrower,  the  relationship  between  that person and the borrower and whether that person carried on a business in Hong Kong  should  be  clearly  explained.    Further,  if  the  borrowing  was  from  a financial  institution  which  did  not  carry  on  business  in  Hong  Kong,  then sufficient  details  of  that  institution  should  be  provided  so  as  to  enable  the Commissioner  to  determine  whether  it  was  an  overseas  financial  institution which could be recognized for the purposes of section 16(2), (3) and (4). To qualify as an overseas financial institution, the institution in question must be adequately supervised by a supervisory authority.

7. Condition (e) would be satisfied by the borrower establishing that -
- the  money  had  been  borrowed  wholly  and  exclusively  to finance capital expenditure on machinery and plant, or for the purchase  of  trading  stock,  for  the  purpose  of  producing chargeable profits; and
- the  lender  was  not  an  associate  of  the  borrower  in  terms  of section 16(3).
8. Finally, condition  (f) related  to  corporate  borrowings  by  way  of debentures or other 'marketable instruments'.    As regards the interest payable on  debentures,  the  condition  would  be  satisfied  where  such  debentures  were listed  on  a  stock  exchange  in  Hong  Kong  or  any  other  stock  exchange recognized by the Commissioner.    Insofar  as  'marketable  instruments'  were concerned, the condition would be satisfied if the instruments were issued-
- bona fide and in the course of carrying on business and was marketable in Hong Kong or any other major financial centre approved by the Commissioner; or
- pursuant  to  the  authorisation  of  the  Securities  and  Futures Commission under section 105 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance [under section 4(2)(g) of the Protection of Investors Ordinance before 1 April 2003.] .
9. Condition (f) would also be satisfied where the borrowing was from an  associated  corporation  and  the  moneys  borrowed  in  the  hands  of  the associated corporation arose entirely from  the proceeds of an issue of debentures or marketable instruments as described above.    As for borrowings

from associated corporations, the deduction for interest paid by the borrowing corporation  was  restricted  to  the  amount  of  interest  paid  by  the  associated corporation to the holders of its debentures or instruments.

## INTEREST DEDUCTION SCHEME AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE 2004 AMENDMENT ORDINANCE

10. The 2004 Amendment Ordinance has introduced substantial amendments  to  the  interest  deduction  scheme.    The  conditions  for  interest deduction under section 16(2)(a) to (f) as regards the types of loans remain, in broad  terms,  the  same  as  before.    However,  the  condition  under  section 16(2)(d)  on  the  loan  not  being  secured  or  guaranteed  by  a  deposit  that  can generate tax free interest has been removed to a new provision [section 16(2A)] which  has  a  broader  application.    New  provisions  have  also  been  added  to restrict  the  deduction  of  interest  despite  the  satisfaction  of  the  respective conditions  under  section  16(2).    The  new  scheme  of  interest  deduction  after the 2004 Amendment Ordinance is discussed below.

### Conditions for Deduction

#### Conditions  (a)  and  (b)  -  borrowings  by  financial  institutions  and  public utilities

11. No  amendment  has  been  made  to  these  two  conditions.    All borrowings by a financial institution and any borrowings by public utilities at a rate of interest not exceeding a specified rate will continue to satisfy conditions (a) and (b) respectively.

#### Condition (c) - borrowings from persons other than financial institution

12. The main part of this subsection remains unchanged. The comments  in  paragraph  4  above  continue  to  apply.    In  addition,  interest deduction  on  a  loan  satisfying  this  condition  is  also  subject  to  the  new restrictions under section 16(2A) and (2B).

#### Condition (d) -borrowings from financial institutions or overseas financial institutions

13. This  condition  will  be  satisfied  if  the  loan  is  borrowed  from  a financial institution or an overseas financial institution.    The requirement that the loan is not being secured by a deposit of the borrower or his associate that can generate tax free interest is removed from this condition, but a similar test is  added as a criterion for restricting interest deduction under section 16(2A). On  top  of  that,  deduction  of  interest  payable  on  this  type  of  loan  is  further subject to the new restrictions under section (2B).

#### Condition (e) - borrowings for specified purposes

14. As before, this condition will be satisfied by the borrower establishing that -
- the  money  has  been  borrowed  wholly  and  exclusively  to finance capital expenditure on machinery and plant, or for the purchase  of  trading  stock,  for  the  purpose  of  producing chargeable profits; and
- the  lender  is  not  an  associate  of  the  borrower  in  terms  of section 16(3).

Deduction of interest under this type of loan is subject to the new restrictions under section 16(2A) and (2B).

#### Condition (f) - interest on debentures and debt instruments

15. This condition continues to relate to corporate borrowings by way of debentures or other marketable debt instruments.    For the interest payable on debentures, the condition will be satisfied where such debentures are listed on a stock exchange in Hong Kong or any other stock exchange recognized by the Commissioner.      Insofar as debt instruments are concerned, the condition will be satisfied if the instruments are issued -
(A) bona  fide  and  in  the  course  of  carrying  on  business  and  is marketed in Hong Kong or any other major financial centre recognized by the Commissioner; or

(B) pursuant to any agreement or arrangements, where the issue of an advertisement, invitation or document in respect of the agreement or arrangements to the public has been authorized by the Securities and Futures Commission under section 105 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance .

**Marketed**

16. The  two  conditions  relating to the interest  deduction  on  debt instruments  resemble  closely  the  corresponding  provisions  that  prevailed immediately  before  the  2004  Amendment  Ordinance. The  only  major difference is that debt instruments (other than those issued under an agreement or  arrangement with the approval  of the Securities and  Futures  Commission) that qualify for interest deduction have to be actually marketed in Hong Kong or in a major financial centre recognized by the Commissioner.    This means that  to  satisfy  the  condition,  not  only  should  the  instrument  be  marketable, there  should  also  be  some  actual  marketing  activities  conducted  when,  or shortly after, the instrument is issued.
17. Whether an instrument has been marketed is a matter of fact to be determined by reference to the common market practices.    The followings are some of the conditions the existence of which may indicate that the instrument has been marketed -
- (i) road-shows or meetings with potential investors are conducted before the issue of the instrument;.
- (ii) research reports on the issuer are published by major market participants;
- (iii) the instrument is rated by reputable credit rating agencies, e.g. Standard and Poor's, Moody's, Fitch IBCA, etc.;
- (iv) the  instrument  is  cleared  through  one  of  the  recognized clearing systems, e.g. the CMU (Central Moneymarkets Unit) of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Euroclear, Clearstream, etc.;
- (v) the description of  the  instrument  is  displayed  on  major real-time financial information networks, e.g. Reuters, Bloomberg, Telerate, etc.;
- (vi) one or more market participants agree to quote bid prices on the instrument under normal market conditions;
- (vii) evidence that shows the existence of trading of the instrument in  the  secondary  markets,  e.g.  transaction  records  in  the clearing systems.

**Issue of debentures or instruments through associated corporation**

18. As before, condition (f) will also be satisfied where the borrowing is from an associated corporation and the moneys borrowed in the hands of the associated corporation arose entirely from  the proceeds of an issue of debentures  or  instruments  as  described  above.    As  for  borrowings  from associated  corporations,  the  deduction  of  interest  paid  by  the  borrowing corporation  is  restricted  to  the  amount  of  interest  paid  by  the  associated corporation to the holders of its debentures or instruments.
19. Deduction  of  interest  under  this  condition  is  subject  to  the  new restriction under section 16(2C).

#### Limitation of Deduction of Interest

20. The 2004 Amendment Ordinance lays down restrictions on interest deduction  under  certain  circumstances. Deduction  of  interest on loans borrowed from non-financial institutions (condition (c) loans), borrowed from financial institutions (condition (d) loans) or borrowed for specified purposes (condition  (e)  loans)  will  all  be  subject  to  two  additional  tests  under  section 16(2A) and (2B) -

**Section 16(2A)**

- (i) the  loan  is  not  secured  by  a  deposit  or  loan  made  by  the borrower or a person associated with the borrower with or to the lender, a financial institution, an overseas financial institution  or  an  associate  of  any  of  these  parties,  where  the interest generated by such deposit or loan is not taxable (i.e. the secured-loan test ); and

**Section 16(2B)**

- (ii) there is no arrangement in place such that the interest payment is  ultimately  paid  back  to  the  borrower  or  to  a  person connected with the borrower (i.e. the interest flow-back test ).
21. As regards the deduction of interest on debentures or debt instruments, it will be subject to the same interest flow-back test (section 16(2C) as that mentioned in paragraph 20(ii) above).    Nevertheless, failure to comply with  these  tests  does  not  necessarily  disqualify  the  interest  expense  in  its entirety from a deduction claim.    In the case of a partial failure, the restriction on interest deduction will only be confined to the portion of the interest relating to the portion of loan, debenture or debt instruments that failed the tests and the time in which the failure persisted.
22. Bankers may have the right to utilise balances in deposit accounts of a customer to set off the outstanding loan and interest payable by that customer in  the  case  of  default  in  repayment  of  the  loan.    Despite  such  right  of  the bankers,  the  balances  in  deposit  accounts  of  a  customer  who  also  borrows money  from  the  bank  would  not  be  taken  as  a  security  of  the  loan  if  the customer's right to withdraw the deposit is not restricted at any time before he defaults  in  repayment  of  the  loan.    Such  deposit,  which  the  depositor  has unrestricted right to operate before the bank exercises the right of set-off, does not appear to be, by nature, a security for the loan.

### Restriction under section 16(2A) [The secured-loan test]

23. Restriction  of  deduction  under  section  16(2A)  applies  to  interest deduction claims on loans satisfying the conditions under section 16(2)(c), (d) or (e).    The provision is triggered when the following situation exists at any time  during  the  basis  period  of  the  borrower  in  respect  of  which  interest deduction is claimed -
- (i) the payment of any interest or the repayment of any principal of the loan in question is secured or guaranteed by a deposit (or a loan);
- (ii) the  said  deposit  (or  loan)  is  made  by  the  borrower  or  an associate of his with (or to) a specified person;
- (iii) the specified person is either -
    - a. the lender or an associate of the lender;
    - b. a financial institution or an associate of a financial institution; or
    - c. an  overseas  financial  institution  or  an  associate  of  an overseas financial institution; and
(iv) the  deposit  or  loan  generates  interest  income  that  is  not chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.

The  term  'associate'  has  the  same  meaning  before  and  after  the  2004 Amendment Ordinance, as defined in section 16(3).

24. This section, when applicable, will reduce the interest deduction by an amount calculated on a basis as is most reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances  of  the  case,  having  regard  to  the  amount  of  interest  income arising  from  deposit  or  loan  in  question.    The  following  examples  illustrate the Department's practice.

**Example 5**

Taxpayer  F  borrowed  $1M  from  Bank  G  at  5%  interest  rate  p.a. The  loan  was  secured  by  a  fixed  deposit  of  $1M  earning  tax-free interest  of  4%  p.a.    There  was  no  other  security.    In  the  year  of assessment, F earned interest of $40,000 from the deposit and paid interest of $50,000 on the loan.

The  amount  of  interest  expenses  allowable  for  deduction  will  be reduced  by  $40,000,  being  the  tax-free  interest  earned.    In  other words, the allowable interest is $10,000.

**Example 6**

The $1M loan in Example 5 was secured by a deposit of $500,000 and  some  shares  which  were  also  worth  $500,000.    The  deposit generated tax-free interest of $20,000.

The  amount  of  interest  expenses  allowable  for  deduction  will  be reduced by the amount of tax-free interest ($20,000) generated from the deposit.    In other words, the allowable interest is $30,000.

**Example 7**

The $1M loan in Example 5 was secured by a deposit of $2M that generated tax-free interest of $80,000.    There was no other security.

The  amount  of  interest  expenses  allowable  for  deduction  will  be reduced by $40,000, which is calculated as follows -

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

**Example 8**

The $1M loan in Example 5 was secured by a deposit of $1M (which generated  tax-free  deposit  interest  of  $40,000)  and  some  shares valued at $500,000.

The  amount  of  interest  expenses  allowable  for  deduction  will  be reduced by $26,667, which is calculated as follows -

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The  value  of  shares  used  as  security  may  vary  from  time  to  time. For the purposes of this calculation, a reasonable basis of averaging, such as by reference to month end balances, will be accepted.

**Example 9**

A deposit of $2M (generating tax-free interest of $80,000) was used to  secure  a  loan  of  $1M  used  for  financing  onshore  business activities  and  another  loan  of  $1.5M  used  for  financing  offshore businesses.    Interest  incurred  on  the  onshore  business  loan  was $50,000 and that on the offshore business loan was $80,000.

In  this  example,  the  deposit  was  used  to  secure  two  loans.    The amount of interest expenses allowable for deduction will be reduced by $32,000, which is calculated as follows -

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

**Example 10**

The two loans in Example 9 were secured by a deposit of $4M, which generated  tax-free interest of  $160,000.    There  was  no  other security.

In  this  example,  the  portion  of  deposit  that  was  used  to  secure  the two  loans  is  $2.5M  /  $4M;  and  out  of  this  portion,  the  part attributable to the onshore loan is $1M / $2.5M.

The  amount  of  interest  expenses  allowable  for  deduction  will  be reduced by $40,000, which is calculated as follows -

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

**Trusts**

25. In  considering  the  relation  between  the  borrower  and  the  holder  of the deposit or loan used as security, if a deposit or loan is made by a trustee of a trust or a corporation controlled by such a trustee, the deposit or loan shall be deemed  to  have  been  made  by  each  of  the  trustee,  the  corporation  and  the beneficiary  under  the trust [section 16(2D)]. Section  16(3) contains a definition of 'beneficiary under the trust'.

### Restriction under section 16(2B) [The interest flow-back test]

26. Deduction  of  interest  on  loans  that  satisfy  the  conditions  under section 16(2)(c), (d) or (e) will be restricted if there is an arrangement under which  the  interest  payable  will  be  paid,  directly  or  through  an  interposed person, back to the borrower or to a person connected with the borrower who is not  an  'excepted  person'  within  the  meaning  of  section  16(2E)(c).    The

provision applies where the said arrangement exists at any time during the basis period of the borrower for the year of assessment in respect of which deduction is claimed for the interest on the respective loan.    Any payment of interest to a trustee or a corporation controlled by the trustee is deemed to be a payment to each of the trustee, the corporation and the beneficiary under the trust [section 16(2E)(b)].

27. The term 'arrangement' is defined in section 2.    It includes -
(a) any agreement, arrangement, understanding, promise or undertaking,  whether  expressed  or  implied,  and  whether  or not enforceable  or intended  to be enforceable, by  legal proceedings; and
(b) any  scheme,  plan,  proposal,  action  or  course  of  action  or course of conduct.

The  provision  for  restricting  interest  deduction  will  be  invoked  whenever arrangements are in place, irrespective of whether the passing of interest has actually occurred.

28. In this section, the reference to 'any sum payable by way of interest on the loan borrowed' is expanded by section 16(2E)(a) to cover the payment of interest or principal in respect of any other loan, the repayment of which is secured  by  the  payment  of  interest  or  repayment  of  principal  of  the  loan  in question (e.g. the second loan is advanced by way of sub-participating in the first loan borrowed by the borrower).

**Example 11**

Company  H  borrowed  a  loan  of  $100M  from  Bank  J.    Bank  J entered into a loan sub-participation arrangement with Company K, which  is  an  associated  company  of  Company  H.    Under  the arrangement, Company K advanced a loan of $100M to Bank J on the condition that the repayment of principal and interest of this loan by Bank J to Company K would only be made on the condition of the repayment of principal and interest of the bank loan by Company H to Bank J.    In practical terms, Bank J is risk free.

In this situation, the interest paid by Bank J to Company K is treated as if it were the interest on the loan borrowed by Company H from Bank J when the restriction of section 16(2B) is considered.    As the interest was paid to an associated company  of  the borrower (Company  H)  of  the  loan,  the  interest  deduction  claim  would  be denied.

**Interest Apportionment**

29. Triggering  the  application  of  section  16(2B)  does  not  necessarily mean that the whole amount of interest incurred on a loan will be disqualified for deduction. Indeed  the  section allows  for  apportionment  of  interest expenses in two ways -
- The  provision  applies  to  arrangements  that  cover  interest payable on a part of a loan, and this allows apportionment of interest in the case where only part of the loan in question is subject  to  an  arrangement  under  which  the  interest  payable will be reverted back to the borrower or his connected person.
- Where the arrangement is in place for only part of the basis period during which the loan interest is incurred, the interest expenses  can  be  apportioned  on  a  time  basis.    This  means that  only  the  portion  of  interest  attributable  to  the  period  of time during  which  the  arrangement  is  in  place will be disallowed from deduction.

**Example 12**

Company L borrowed a loan of $10M from Bank M at the interest rate of 10%  p.a. At its inception, $7M  of the loan was sub-participated by Company N, an associate company of Company L.    The  repayment by Bank M to Company N of the principal and interest of the $7M loan was made conditional to or secured by the repayment  of  principal  and  interest  of  the  $10M  loan  made  by Company L to Bank M.    In a year of assessment Company L paid interest  of  $1M  to  Bank  M,  and  correspondingly  Bank  M  paid interest in the amount attributable to the $7M loan to Company N.

In this example only $7M of the total loan was sub-participated by a person connected with the borrower (Company L).    Thus only the interest attributable to the sub-participated portion, that is the amount of $700,000 ($1M x 7/10), is subject to the adjustment under section 16(2B).    As  this  part  of  the  loan  was  participated  for  the  whole period  during  which  interest  was  incurred,  the  full  amount  of  the $700,000 interest would be disallowed by section 16(2B).    However, the interest on the remaining part of loan which was not sub-participated  by  the  borrower  or  a  person  connected  to  him  (in this case interest of $300,000) would be allowable for deduction.

**Example 13**

If  in  Example  12,  the  loan  of  $7M  (C)  was  sub-participated  by Company N for  only  6  months  (A)  during  the  basis  period  of  the year  of  assessment  (B)  concerned,  the  operation  of  section  16(2B) will be as follows -

|                                                                                        |   ($M) |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Interest payable on the portion of loan which was sub-participated to CompanyN         |   0.7  |
| Deduct: by the amount (A/B x C) (183days / 365 days x $0.7M)                           |   0.35 |
| Interest on sub-participated loan deductible                                           |   0.35 |
| Add: Interest on the portion of the loan that is not sub-participated ($3M/$10M x $1M) |   0.3  |
| Total interest deduction                                                               |   0.65 |

Note  that  the  amount  of  interest  paid  on  the  sub-participated  loan (the loan advanced by Company N to Bank M), even if of different amount, is not relevant in the computation.

### Restriction under section 16(2C) [Interest flow-back test on debt instruments]

30. Like interest on ordinary loans, deduction of interest on debentures or  debt  instruments  that  satisfy  the  conditions  under  section  16(2)(f)  will  be restricted  if  there  is  an  arrangement  under  which  the  interest  payable  will  be paid, directly or through an interposed person, back to the borrower (the issuer) or  to  a  person  connected  with  the  borrower  who is not an 'excepted person' within the meaning of section 16(2F)(c).    The provision applies when the said arrangement exists at any time during the basis period of the borrower for the year of assessment in respect of which deduction is claimed for the interest on the  respective  loan.    Any  payment  of  interest  to  a  trustee  or  a  corporation controlled by the trustee is deemed to be a payment to each of the trustee, the corporation and the beneficiary under the trust [section 16(2F)(b)].
31. Again,  the  term  'arrangement'  has  a  wide  coverage  as  defined  in section  2  (see  paragraph  27  above).    The  provision  for  restricting  interest deduction will be invoked whenever arrangements are in place, irrespective of whether the passing of interest has actually occurred.    Peculiar to the nature of debentures and debt instruments, the term includes the holding of debentures or debt  instruments  either  directly  or  beneficially  (i.e.  holding  any  interest  in debentures or debt instruments).
32. In this section, the reference to 'any sum payable by way of interest on the debentures or instruments concerned' is expanded by section 16(2F)(a) to  cover  the  payment  of interest or principal in respect of any other loan the repayment  of  which  is  secured  by  the  payment  of  interest  or  repayment  of principal of the debentures or instruments concerned (see Example 11 above).

**Interest Apportionment**

33. Section  16(2C)  allows  for  apportionment  of  interest  expenses  in three ways -
- The provision applies  to  arrangements  in  relation  to  interest expenses payable on any debentures or instruments within an issue. This  allows  for  apportionment  of  interest  expenses when only some of the debentures or instruments issued are held by the borrower or a connected person of the borrower.
- The provision also applies to arrangements that cover interest expenses payable in the interest on any debentures or instrument concerned.    This allows apportionment of interest expenses  in  the case where  the  beneficial interest in a debenture  or  an  instrument  is  shared  among  a  number  of persons,  and  only  some  of  such  persons  are  connected  with the issuer.
- Where the arrangement is in place for only part of the basis period of the issuer during which the loan interest claimed for deduction was incurred, the interest expenses can be apportioned  on  a  time  basis.    This  means  that  only  the portion of interest expenses attributable to the period of time during which the arrangement was in place will be disallowed from deduction.

**Example 14**

Corporation P issued debentures in amount of $100M  in a recognized overseas stock market.    Out of the issue, an associated company  of  Corporation  P  subscribed  $80M  and  acquired  the remaining  $20M  debentures  from  the  market  in  the  middle  of  the year of  assessment.  During the year of  assessment concerned total interest in the amount of $10M was paid.    Corporation P adopts a basis period that corresponds to a year of assessment (i.e. for year ended 31 March).

The interest deduction calculation will be as follows -

($M) the 8

Interest on $80M  debentures subscribed by associated company

Reduced by the amount attributable to the holding of

the associated company: 8

Balance deductible: 0

Interest  on  the  $20M  debentures  acquired  by  the associated company in the middle of the year: 2

Reduced by the amount attributable to the holding of the associated company (183 / 365 x $2M): 1

Interest on this portion of debenture deductible: 1

Total interest deduction ($0M + $1M): 1

### Persons Connected with the Borrower [Section 16(3B)]

34. This is a new concept under the interest flow-back test.    A person is regarded as being connected with the borrower if the person is -
- (a) an associated corporation of the borrower; or
- (b) a person (other than a corporation) -
    - (i) who controls the borrower;
    - (ii) who is controlled by the borrower; or
    - (iii) who is under the control of the same person as is the borrower.

35. The term 'associated corporation' is defined in section 16(3).    This definition  has  not  been  changed  by  the  2004  Amendment  Ordinance.    The meaning of the term 'control' [which is formerly defined in section 16(3)] is now provided under section 16(3A).    So far as a corporation is concerned, the meaning of control has not been changed by the 2004 Amendment Ordinance. However, it has been expanded to cover the situation of controlling a person who is not a corporation.

### Excepted Persons

36. This  is  another  new  concept  under  the  interest  flow-back  test. Interest restriction under the test does not apply where under the arrangement

concerned,  the  interest  flows  to  a  connected  person  who  is  an  'excepted person'.    The  definitions  of  excepted  person  under  sections  16(2E)(c)  and 16(2F)(c) are the same and cover the following categories -

- a  person  who  is  charged  to  tax  in  respect  of  the  interest  in question;
- a person acting as a bare trustee;
- a beneficiary of a unit trust to which section 26A(1A)(a)(i) or (ii)  applies,  where  the  interest  payment  is  in  respect  of  a specified investment scheme;
- a  member  of  a  recognized  retirement  scheme,  or  a  similar scheme  established  outside  Hong  Kong  accepted  by  the Commissioner;
- a  public  body  (which  is  defined  under  section  3  of  the Interpretation  and  General  Clauses  Ordinance,  Cap  1,  as including the Executive Council, the Legislative Council, and District Council, any other urban, rural or municipal council, any department of the Government, and any undertaking by or of the Government);
- a  body  corporate  of  which  the  Government  owns  more than half in nominal value of the issued share capital; or
- a financial institution or an overseas financial institution.

### Exemption for Market Makers of Debt Instruments

37. Section 16(2G) provides for an exemption from the interest deduction  restriction  under  section  16(2C)  in  respect  of  debentures  or  debt instruments.    The  restriction  does  not  apply  where  under  an  arrangement interest  on  debentures  or  debt  instruments is  payable to a  market  maker who holds such debentures or instruments in the ordinary course of conduct of his trade, profession or business in respect of market making, notwithstanding that the market maker is a person connected with the issuer.

38. The purpose of holding the debentures or debt instruments must be for  providing  liquidity  for  such  securities.    Under  normal  circumstances, long-term  or  substantial  holdings  of  the  securities  will  not  be  considered  as consistent with market making activities.    For this purpose, a holding of over 5% of an issue for a period of over 3 months will not be taken as a holding of the  securities  in  the  ordinary  course  of  conduct  of  market  making  activities, unless the Commissioner is satisfied that there are reasonable explanations for doing so.
39. To  qualify  for  the  exemption,  the  market  maker  must  be  a  person who -
- is  a  licensed  or  registered  dealer  of  securities  under  the Securities  and  Futures  Ordinance  (Cap.  571),  or  in  a  major financial centre outside Hong  Kong  recognized by the Commissioner;
- in  the  ordinary  course  of  conduct  of  the  market  making business,  holds  himself  out  as  being  willing  to  buy  and  sell securities for his own account and on a regular basis; and
- is actively involved in market making in securities issued by a wide range of unrelated institutions.

## APPLICATION OF THE GENERAL ANTI-AVOIDANCE PROVISION (SECTION 61A)

40. While the conditions and restrictions on interest expenses deduction under  section  16  lay  down  specific  rules  governing  the  interest  deduction scheme,  compliance  with  such  rules  and  conditions  does  not  preclude  the application of the general anti-avoidance provision under section 61A in cases that satisfy the conditions specified in section 61A. Support for this proposition  can  be  found  in  the  Privy  Council  decision  of CIR  v.  Challenge Corporation  Limited,  [1986]  STC  548 ,  and  the  Court  of  Appeal  decision  of Yick Fung Estates Ltd. v. CIR, 5 HKTC 52 .

## GRANDFATHERING PROVISIONS

41. The application of the new interest deduction provisions of the 2004 Amendment Ordinance is  set  out  in  section  16(5A).    As  a  general  rule,  the new  scheme  will  apply  to  interests  incurred  after  the  commencement  of  the 2004 Amendment Ordinance, that is, on or after 25 June 2004.
42. Nevertheless,  interest  incurred  under  a  transaction  which  was  the subject  of  an  advance  clearance,  or  under  an  arrangement  which  was  the subject  of  an  advance  ruling  given  under  section  88A,  can  be  grandfathered from  the  application  of  the  new  scheme.    To  qualify  for  grandfathering,  the advance  clearance  or  the  advance  ruling  must  have  been  given  by  the Commissioner,  before  25  June  2004,  on  the  issue  that  the  transaction  or  the arrangement, as the case may be, would not fall within the terms of section 61A. Deductions of interest expenses arising from these transactions or arrangements (incurred after 25 June 2004) are governed by the provisions that were in force before the amendments made by the 2004 Amendment Ordinance are effected [see paragraphs 2 - 9 above], as if the amendments of the 2004 Amendment Ordinance to section 16 had not taken effect.

## DUTY OF THE TAXPAYER TO DISCLOSE DETAILS OF INTEREST DEDUCTION CLAIMS

43. It  is  the  duty  of  the  taxpayer  who  makes  a  claim  for  interest deduction to disclose the full details of the facts that may  affect the deductibility  of  the  interest  concerned.    It  is  therefore  necessary  for  him  to ascertain and to disclose in the tax return whether there is any arrangement in place that may trigger the interest deduction restriction provisions under section 16(2A), (2B) or (2C).
