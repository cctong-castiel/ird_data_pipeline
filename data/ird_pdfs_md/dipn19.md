## INTRODUCTION

On 16 August 1989 the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, on behalf of the Hong Kong Government, signed a note accepting a proposal made by the Consul General of the United States of America in Hong Kong, on behalf of the United States Government, in respect of the taxation of income derived by residents  of  the  two  territories  from  the  international  operation  of  ships. Pursuant to the agreement, the Double Taxation Relief (Income from Shipping Operations) (United States of America) Order 1989 was made by the Governor in  Council  under  section  49  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  on  29  August 1989. A copy of the Order is attached as Appendix A.

## THE US 1986 TAX REFORM ACT

2. The United States Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed the basis upon which non-US resident shipowners are taxed in the United States. Previously, foreign shipowners engaged in the US shipping business were subject to US tax on  their  US  source  shipping  income  unless  their  ships  were  registered  in jurisdictions  which  granted  US  shipowners  a  reciprocal  exemption  from  tax. There was no requirement that the ships be owned by a corporation located in such  jurisdictions  or  that  the  shipowners  be  resident  in  those  jurisdictions. Accordingly,  although  Hong  Kong  did  not  grant  US  shipowners  exemption from tax, Hong Kong shipowners who registered their ships in places such as Liberia or Panama, were able to obtain exemption from US tax on the basis of reciprocity.
3. Under the amended arrangements implemented by the Tax Reform Act, the determinant of exemption is no longer the flag or place of registry but the country of residence of the shipowner or, if the owner is a corporation, its shareholders. Exemption  will be granted only where the shipowner or shareholders are resident in a jurisdiction which provides reciprocal exemption to US shipowners.
4. Non-US  shipowners  not  satisfying  the  residency  requirements  are liable to United States tax at the rate of 4% of -
- (a) 1/2 of the gross revenue derived from an inward voyage to the United States, and
- (b) 1/2  of  the  gross  revenue  derived  from  an  outward  voyage from the United States

unless  their  income  is  considered  effectively  connected  with  a  US  transport business.

## THE ORDER

5. Section 49 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance empowers the Governor in  Council  to  declare  by  Order  that  arrangements  have  been  made  with  a territory outside of Hong Kong to afford relief from double taxation where that territory also imposes an income tax or tax of a similar character.
6. Under the agreement with the United States, which has been ratified by  the  Order,  the  Governments  of  the  United  States  and  Hong  Kong  will exempt from tax the gross income derived from the international operation of ships by individuals who are residents of the other territory and corporations which are incorporated or managed and controlled in the other territory.
7. The  exemption  granted  to  Hong  Kong  corporations  by  the  United States only applies when either :
(a) the corporation's stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established stock market in Hong Kong, the United States or another country which grants an equivalent exemption to US corporations, or
(b) more than 50 percent of the value of the corporation's stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by individuals who are residents of  Hong  Kong  or  of  a  country  that  grants  an  equivalent exemption to US corporations or by a corporation organized in  a  country  which  grants  an  equivalent  exemption  to  US corporations  and  whose  stock  is  primarily  and  regularly traded  on  an  established  stock  market  in  that  country,  the United States or a country that grants an equivalent exemption to US corporations.

8. The exemption provided by Hong Kong to US corporations is based upon identical criteria.

## INCOME FROM THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATION OF SHIPS

9. The shipping income to which the Order applies is the gross income arising from the international operation of ships, including -
- (a) income from the rental of ships used in international transport on a full (time or voyage) or bareboat basis;
- (b) income  from  the  rental  of  containers  and  related  equipment used in international transport which is incidental to income from the international operation of ships;
- (c) income from the participation in marine transport pools which engage in the international operation of ships; and
- (d) gains from the sale, disposal or other alienation of ships by a person primarily engaged in the international operation, lease or rental of ships.
10. International  aircraft  operations  are  specifically  excluded  from  the scope of the agreement.

## IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGREEMENT

11. The agreement has effect with respect to taxable years on or after 1 January 1987. Income to which the Order applies derived on or after 1 January 1987 will therefore be exempt. Where the effective date of the Order falls part way  through  a  basis  period,  any  income  eligible  for  exemption  should  be computed on a pro rata time basis.
