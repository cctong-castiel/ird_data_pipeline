## INTRODUCTION

### Background

This Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 33 (DIPN 33)  was  first  issued  in  June  1998,  and  serves  to  assist  insurance  agents  in understanding and meeting their tax obligations. For the purposes of DIPN 33, the  term  'insurance  agent'  means  an  individual  who  holds  himself  out  to advise on or arrange contracts of insurance as an agent or sub-agent of one or more insurers (i.e. persons carrying on insurance business).

2. In the 1998 version of DIPN 33, it was mentioned that during 1996 the Department noticed that the record keeping standards of a large number of self-employed  insurance  agents  were  unsatisfactory  and  was  faced  with  the likelihood of considerable administrative difficulties in ascertaining the correct assessable profits of the individuals concerned.    Following consultations with a number of associations representing insurance agents, the Department agreed, as an exceptional matter and for the sake of expediency and consistency, that where  no  books  or  records  were  available,  an  amount  equivalent  to  1/3  of commission income would be allowed as deductible outgoings and expenses. That practice was, however, only applicable in respect of assessments for the year of assessment 1995/96 and prior years. Since 1998, the Board of Review and the Court have delivered several decisions involving insurance agents or having impact on the tax liability of insurance agents. Thus, there is a need to revise the 1998 version to bring it up-to-date.
3. This revision will also highlight the requirements of certain provisions in the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112) (the Ordinance) and the Business Registration Ordinance (Cap. 310) which are applicable to insurance agents.

### Profits tax or salaries tax

4. Insurance  agents  who  are  self-employed  are  assessed  under  the profits tax provisions of the Ordinance, whereas those who are employees are assessed under the salaries tax provisions.    Whether an insurance agent is an employee or self-employed is a question of fact. Generally, the situation will be  obvious. If  an  individual  is  employed  to  solicit  and  negotiate  insurance

contracts  on  behalf  of  his  employer,  then  the  remuneration  therefrom  should clearly  be  charged  to  salaries  tax. On the  other  hand,  if  the  individual  has taken out business registration and carries on an insurance agency business on his own account, he should be assessed to profits tax in respect of the profits so derived.

5. In case of doubt, assistance in ascertaining the correct position can be obtained by applying objective tests (e.g. the control test, the integration test, the  economic  reality  test  and  mutuality  of  obligation  test)  to  the  relationship between the insurance agent and the insurer. If the relationship is ambiguous, the contract may become the best material from which to gather the true legal relationship: see Massey v. Crown Life Insurance Co. [1973] 1 All ER 576 .

## TAX TREATMENT UNDER PROFITS TAX

### Income chargeable under section 14

6. In  general,  a  self-employed  insurance  agent  would  derive  from  his carrying on of a business in Hong Kong income such as commission, agency fees,  bonus,  allowances,  etc. It  is  generally  accepted  that  those  receipts  are taxable  under  section  14  of  the  Ordinance,  but  it  is  not  unusual  that  some insurance agents would object to the taxation of certain categories of receipts. Set out below are the details of how the Department views the taxation of such receipts.

### Upfront payments

7. A  self-employed  insurance  agent  may  receive  from  an  insurer upfront payments such as 'initial signing fees', 'goodwill payments', 'sign-on bonus', etc. The insurer usually pays the upfront payments to the insurance agent  after  the  latter  registers  and  commences  service  as  the  insurer's  agent. The  agency  service  agreement  entered  into  by  the  insurance  agent  with  the insurer normally contains, among others, the following terms:
(a) the  upfront  payments  have  to  be  set  off  against  commission income  which  will  be  earned  by  the  insurance  agent  over  a period  of  time  commencing  from  or  around  the  agreement date; and

- (b) where  the  insurance  agent  fails  to  remain  in  service  for  a minimum service period or 'lock-up' period, he will have to repay all or part of the upfront payments to the insurer.
8. The  upfront  payments  are  reported  to  the  Department  in  the  year when the payments are paid to the agent. However, the agent may adopt one of the following approaches in drawing up his profit and loss account:
- (a) exclude the whole of the upfront payment from his income on the ground that the payment is a loan;
- (b) divide  the  upfront  payment  by  the  number  of  months  in  the minimum service period and recognize an appropriate fraction as income in the respective years; or
- (c) include  the  whole  upfront  payment  as  income  in  the  year when the minimum service period expires (i.e. when the right to ask for repayment is waived by the insurance company).
9. The Department would not accept the approaches in paragraph 8 to ascertain the assessable profits of an insurance agent. The upfront payment is paid  because  the  agent  agrees  to  the  appointment  and  to  remain  as  the company's agent. Once the upfront payment is received, the insurance agent holds  the  sum  beneficially  and  is  entitled  to  use  it  for  whatever  purposes  he likes, including for his trade and business. In any event, the upfront payment is  clearly  a  trading  receipt  chargeable to profits tax. In Lo Tim-fat v. CIR 6 HKTC  725 ,  the  taxpayer  argued  that  only  20  per  cent  instead  of  the  entire amount  of  his  initial  signing  fee,  balance  of  initial  signing  fee  and  monthly bonus should be subject to profits tax in the year concerned as he had to refund part  of  the  lump  sum  to  the  insurance  company  if  the  engagement  was terminated  within  5  years.    In  dismissing  the  taxpayer's  appeal,  the  court followed the ratio in Smart v. Lincolnshire Sugar Co. Ltd. [1937] 20 TC 643 and made the following comments at 741:

'In Smart  v.  Lincolnshire  Sugar  Co.  Ltd… .  the  House  of  Lords decided  that  notwithstanding  that  the  amounts  were  described  as advances in truth the payments were not in the nature of loans at all. The  payments  were  made  to  the  taxpayer  in  order  that  the  money

might  be  used  in  its  business. They  were  supplementary  trading receipts bestowed upon the taxpayer by the Government and proper to  be  taken  into  computation  in  arriving  at  the  balance  of  the taxpayer's profits and gains for the year in which they were received. Even though the amounts were repayable upon certain contingencies, they should not be treated as trading receipts only when it could be certain that the repayment was not required.

In the present case, once the amount of the Balance of Signing Fee was  received,  the  Appellant  held  the  sum  beneficially  and  was entitled to use it for whatever purpose he liked including for his trade and business.    Although there was a possibility that he might have to  repay  part  of  the  amount  received  to  AIA  in  the  future,  on  the authority of Smart v. Lincolnshire Sugar Co. Ltd. ,  I  am of the view that  the  amount  should  properly  be  considered  to  be  part  of  his trading receipt for the year when the sum was received and accrued to him.'

10. Hence, it is not open for an insurance agent to argue that the upfront payments  are  not  trading  receipts  or  even  if  they  are  trading  receipts,  they should be assessed pro rata over the minimum  service period. The Department will examine the terms of the contracts entered into between the insurance  company  and  the  agent  to  ascertain  the  year  in  which  the  upfront payment  accrued  to  the  taxpayer  as  income. The  upfront  payments  will  be taxable in the year when the amounts accrue to the insurance agent.

### Lump sum for cancellation of contractual rights

11. In  the  course  of  his  business,  an  insurance  agent  may  for  some reasons  relinquish  and  forfeit  all  or  part  of  certain  contractual  rights  in consideration  of  a  lump  sum  payment  from  the  insurance  company.    The question of whether the lump sum receipt is of capital or revenue nature is a question  of  mixed  fact  and  law  and  all  surrounding  circumstances,  including the nature of the contractual rights which were cancelled or terminated and the effect  that  cancellation  or  termination  had  on  the  capital  structure  of  the insurance agent's business, have to be considered. In this regard, the Board of Review in Case No. D12/90 5 IRBRD 118 , said at 121 and 122:

'It is clear from the decided cases that where a person is carrying on a trading or agency type business, sums of money which the person receives for changing or giving up agencies or agency rights are to be construed as being payments received in the course of carrying on the business unless it is clear from the facts that the payment is of a capital nature…. The question to be answered is whether or not the rights  or  benefits  which  the  Taxpayer  was  entitled  to  under  her agreement with the insurance company comprised a capital asset of her business.

In  the  present  case,  …  it  is  clear  that  the  business  of  the  Taxpayer continued after the receipt of this lump sum payment much as it had done  before. We  cannot  see  any  justification  for  finding  on  the facts that the rights given up by the Taxpayer were capital assets of her  business. She was doing no more than accepting a lump sum payment  in  exchange  for  giving  up  the  right  to  receive  override commissions in respect of two out of seven 'units'. The Taxpayer had not invested any capital in acquiring these 'units' and indeed so far as we are aware, she had no formal contractual relationships with the  'units'. Her  contractual  relationship  was  with  the  insurance company. In all of the circumstances, we find on the facts that the payment received was a trading receipt received in the course of the business of the Taxpayer and accordingly is subject to profits tax.'

12. The  Department  will  look  at  all  relevant  facts  of  each  case  in determining  whether  the  receipt  is  capital  or  revenue  in  nature. In  general, amounts  received  in  connection  with  the  cancellation  or  variation  of  agency contracts made in the course of the carrying on of the business of an insurance agent  are  of  a  revenue  nature  and  chargeable  to  profits  tax.    Where  the contract or right which has been cancelled relates to the whole structure of the insurance agency business, the Department would consider whether the amount received for the cancellation of right is of a capital nature and thus excluded from the computation of assessable profits.

### Commission from own or family member insurance policies

13. On occasion, an insurance agent may earn commission in respect of the  insurance  policies  taken  out  by  himself  or  his  family  members.    The

Department  holds  the  view  that  just  like  transactions  with  other  ordinary customers, the insurance agent acts in the name and on behalf of the insurer in introducing, proposing and carrying out work preparatory to the conclusion of, or in concluding, those contracts of insurance, or in assisting in the administration and performance of such contracts.

14. The  insurance  agent  derives  commission  income  in  respect  of  the policies taken out by him or his family members with the insurers in return for his  services  rendered  in  the  ordinary  course  of  carrying  on  of  the  insurance agency business.    The commission income concerned has no difference from that earned from other ordinary customers. In the circumstances, the commission so earned is clearly a trading receipt chargeable to profits tax.

### Allowable deductions

15. Expenditure incurred by a self-employed insurance agent generally qualifies  for  deduction  if  it  satisfies  the  requirements  of  section  16(1)  of  the Ordinance and is not precluded under the provisions of section 17. Broadly put, in arriving at the assessable profits, deductions are allowed in respect of:
(a) all  outgoings  and  expenses  to  the  extent  to  which  they  are incurred by the agent during the basis period for the year of assessment in the production of profits in respect of which he or she is chargeable to tax;

but excluding:

- (b) domestic or private expenses, including the cost of travelling between residence and place of business;
- (c) any expenditure of a capital nature or any loss or withdrawal of capital;
- (d) rent of, or expenses in connection with, any premises or part of premises not occupied or used for the purpose of producing chargeable profits; and

- (e) any remuneration or interest on capital or loans payable to the agent or the agent's spouse in the case of a sole proprietorship business, or to a partner or a partner's spouse in the case of a partnership business.
16. Although  the  circumstances  and modus  operandi of  an  individual agent  can  obviously  have  a  bearing  on  the  expenditure  which  will  qualify, deductions are commonly allowed in respect of the following:
- (a) commission paid to sub-agents and runners;
- (b) salaries to employees;
- (c) employee benefits;
- (d) incentives to sub-agents;
- (e) gifts and souvenirs; and
- (f) entertainment expenses.
17. As mentioned in paragraph 7 above, an insurance agent may have to repay the upfront payments to the insurance company if his service with the insurance  company  is  prematurely  terminated.    Such  repayments  made  in pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  contract  can  be  accepted  as  deductible  under section 16(1) of the Ordinance in the year in which the contingencies giving rise to the repayment are crystallized. If a provision is made in the profit and loss  account  during  the  basis  period  in  which  the  contingent  liability  is crystallized but the actual repayment was made after the accounting year-end date, a deduction can be allowed in the year of provision. In order to qualify for deduction, the insurance agent must prove the date on which his liability to repay was crystallized, which might not be the same year as the year when the upfront payments were assessed to tax. He will also be required to provide documentary evidence, such as confirmation from the insurance company, to substantiate his claim.
18. It should be apparent from paragraphs 23 to 26 below that generally the  insurance  agent  must  be  able,  if  requested,  to  produce  documentary

evidence  to  substantiate  any  deduction  claimed. It  should  be  noted  that  the onus of proving that an expense is deductible is not necessarily discharged by producing  the  relevant  ledger  account. In So  Kai  Tong,  Stanley  trading  as Stanley So &amp; Co. v. CIR 6 HKTC 38 , Chu J said at 86:

'The ledger is only a secondary document. It would be incumbent upon the appellant to adduce the primary documents to support his case.'

19. Furthermore,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  onus  of  proving  that  an expense is deductible is not necessarily discharged by producing the relevant receipt. The taxpayer must also be able to establish to the satisfaction of the Assessor that the expense was incurred in the production of assessable profits. In  Board  of  Review  Decisions Case  No.  D1/06  21  IRBRD  102 ,  the  Board rejected  the  insurance  agent's  claim  that  the  alleged  written  agreements  with sub-agents and staff and receipts of expenses were contemporaneous. On the facts of that case, the Board held that the insurance agent did not incur any of the sums she claimed to have been incurred, and even if any such expenses had been incurred, they were of a domestic or private nature and not incurred in the production of assessable profits.
20. Examples of questions which may be asked by the Department for the purpose of establishing whether a deduction claimed is allowable are set out in Appendix A.

### Apportionment of expenses

21. Where  an  outgoing  or  expense  is  not  wholly  incurred  in  the production of assessable profits, for example, the expense is partly of a private nature,  the  full  amount  of  the  expenditure  cannot  be  claimed  as  a  deduction. In So Kai Tong, Chu J said at 81:

'(Once) the Commissioner, on the material before her, comes to the view that only part of the outgoing or expense under examination is incurred for the production of chargeable profits, she is under a duty to  ascertain  the  extent  to  which  such  outgoing  and  expense  is  so incurred. In  performing the task, regards will have to be made to Rule 2A of the Inland Revenue Rules.'

22. Rule 2A of the Inland Revenue Rules provides that for the purpose of ascertaining the extent to which the outgoing or expense is deductible under section 16 of the Ordinance, it should be apportioned on such a basis as is most appropriate  to  the  activities  of  the  business.    Accordingly,  where  such  an expense  has  been  incurred,  the  basis  of  apportionment  of  the  expense  to  be claimed  as  a  deduction  should  be  clearly  detailed  in  the  taxpayer's  return. Further guidance as to the apportionment of expenses is contained in Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 3 (Revised) - Profits tax Apportionment of expenses.

## BUSINESS RECORDS TO BE KEPT

### Section 51C

23. Section  51C  of  the  Ordinance  requires  every  person  carrying  on business  in  Hong  Kong  to  keep  sufficient  records  in  the  English  or  Chinese language of his income and expenditure to enable the assessable profits of the business to  be  readily  ascertained.    Business  records  must  be  retained  for  at least 7 years. Failure to keep the prescribed records may result in a fine of up to $100,000.
24. For  the  purposes  of  section  51C,  the  term  'records'  is  defined  to include:
- (a) books  of  account  (whether  kept  in  a  legible  form,  or  in  a non-legible  form  by  means  of  a  computer  or  otherwise) recording receipts and payments, or income and expenditure; and
- (b) vouchers,  bank  statements,  invoices,  receipts  and  such  other documents as are necessary to verify the entries in the books of account.
25. Section  51C  also  provides,  so  far  as  is  relevant,  that  the  records required  to  be  kept  in  respect  of  a  business  carried  on  during  any  year  of assessment by any person include:

- (a) a record of the assets and liabilities of the person in relation to the business;
- (b) a record of all entries from day to day of all sums of money received  and  expended  by  the  person  in  relation  to  the business and the matters in respect of which the receipt and expenditure take place; and
- (c) as the business of an insurance agent involves the provision of services,  records  of  the  services  provided  in  sufficient  detail to  enable  the  Commissioner  of  Inland  Revenue  to  readily verify the entries referred to in (b) above.
26. Further information concerning  record keeping requirements is provided in the pamphlet 'A Guide to Keeping Business Records' which can be downloaded from the Department's web site: www.ird.gov.hk.

## TAX TREATMENT UNDER SALARIES TAX

### Income chargeable under section 8

27. Where an insurance agent is an employee chargeable to salaries tax, his  income  arising  in  or  derived  from  Hong  Kong  from  an  employment  of profit is assessable under section 8(1) of the Ordinance.

### Upfront payments

28. In accordance with the terms of employment contract, an insurance agent  may  receive  from  the  insurance  company  upfront  payments  upon commencement  of  employment. Where  the  insurance  agent  terminates  the employment  within  the  minimum  service  period,  all  or  part  of  the  upfront payments may have to be repaid to the insurance company.
29. The Board of Review has in several cases held that upfront payments are  income  from  employment  under  section  9(1)  of  the  Ordinance,  see  for example, Board of Review Decisions Case No. D3/94 9 IRBRD 69, Case No. D24/05 20 IRBRD 382 and Case No. D26/07 22 IRBRD 601 .

30. In Board of Review Decisions Case No. D60/97 12 IRBRD 367 , the Board summarized the applicable law succinctly at 374 as follows:

'On  the  basis of various authorities brought  to our attention, including Hochstrasser  v.  Maye s (1959)  38  TC  673 per  Viscount Simonds at 705, to be liable to salaries tax the Sum must arise from the employment, be referable to the services the Taxpayer rendered by  virtue  of  his  office  and  must  be  something  in  the  nature  of  a reward for services past, present and future.'

31. The English authorities are also relevant. In Shilton v. Wilmshurst [1991] STC 88 , Lord Templeman had this to say at 91:

' Section 181 (of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970) is not limited  to  emoluments  provided  in  the  course  of  employment;  the section must therefore apply first to an emolument which is paid as a reward for past services and as an inducement to continue to perform services and, second, to an emolument  which  is paid as an inducement to enter into a contract  of  employment  and  to  perform services  in  the  future.    The  result  is  that  an  emolument  'from employment'  means  an  emolument  'from  being  or  becoming  an employee'.'

32. In Case  No.  D26/07 ,  the  appellant  received  a  sign-on  bonus  and settling-in allowance at the commencement of his employment for agreeing to work  with  the  employer  for  a  minimum  period  of  12  months.    Upon  his resignation, he refunded to the employer a pro-rata portion of the sign-on bonus and  settling-in  allowance  as  he  did  not  complete  the  minimum  employment period. Insofar  as  the  deduction  of  repayment  of  upfront  payments  under section  12(1)(a)  of  the  Ordinance  is  concerned,  the  Board  of  Review  said  at 605:

'In our view, the sum refunded was not paid wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the production of assessable income, and is in any event of a capital rather than recurrent nature.'

However,  the  Board  was  of  the  view  that  on  the  proper  construction  of  the contract  of  employment,  the  appellant  was  only  entitled  to  receive  the  full

sign-on  bonus  and  settling-in  allowance  contingent  on  his  having  served  the full 12 months from the date of employment. The appellant was not entitled to the full sign-on bonus or the full settling-in allowance.

33. The  Department  will  follow  the  Board's  decision  in Case  No. D26/07. Where the contract is terminated before the expiry of the minimum service  period  and  the  insurance  agent  has  to  repay  part  of  the  upfront payments in accordance with the terms of employment contract with the insurer, upon  application  by  the  insurance  agent  concerned,  the  Department  would consider revising the salaries tax assessment, which has previously included the upfront  payments,  to  reflect  the  sum repaid.    In  the  circumstances,  the Department would accept that the amount of income previously chargeable is subject  to  a  contingency  bearing  upon  the  actual  amount  of  income  which should  be  brought  to  tax. In  supporting  such  an  application,  the  insurance agent has to provide sufficient documentary evidence to substantiate his claim of refund.

### Deduction under salaries tax

34. In  order  to  be  deducted  from  assessable  income  under  section 12(1)(a) of the Ordinance, expenses incurred by an employed insurance agent must  have  been  incurred  'in  the  production  of  the  assessable  income',  and equally  must  have  been  'wholly  and  exclusively'  as  well  as  'necessarily' incurred.    Although an expense might have been incurred 'for' the production of  assessable  income,  it  might  not  be  incurred  'in'  the  production  of  that income if it is not directly referable to the performance of duties in doing the work required under his employment.    The expenses might be personal to the insurance agent arising from the terms of his contract of employment with the insurance company.    In Roskams v. Bennett 32 TC 129 , the judge rejected an insurance agent's contention that 20 per cent of the expenditure on rent, rates, electricity, gas and water should be allowed for deduction.    Further guidance as to the deductibility of expenses under salaries tax is contained in Departmental  Interpretation  and  Practice  Notes  No.  9  (Revised)  -  Major deductible items under salaries tax .

## PENAL PROVISIONS

### Sections 80, 82 and 82A

35. The  Ordinance  provides  in  sections  80  and  82  for  penalties  to  be imposed  where  taxpayers  fail  to  comply  with  certain  obligations  under  the legislation  without  reasonable  excuse  or  wilfully  with  intent  to  evade  tax. Depending on the nature of an offence, penalty by way of imprisonment or fine (or  both)  can  be  imposed:  see The Queen v. Ng Wing-keung, Paul and Choi Sin-biu  4  HKTC  264 . The  Ordinance  also  provides  in  section  82A  that  in some circumstances, as an alternative to prosecution action, the Commissioner or  a  Deputy  Commissioner  may  impose  additional  tax. In  such  cases  the maximum additional tax is three times the amount of tax undercharged or that which would have been undercharged if the matter had not been detected.
