## INTRODUCTION

This Practice Note was first issued in November 1996, and serves to outline the Profits Tax treatment of stock borrowing and lending transactions which come within the scope of section 15E of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (the  Ordinance). The  current  revision  reflects  changes  in  the  definition  of certain terms, but the Department's approach in applying section 15E remains the same.

2. Section  15E  was  added  to  the  Ordinance  by  the  Inland  Revenue (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 1994 and came into effect on 8 July 1994. On the same date, the Stamp Duty (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 1994 also came  into  effect  and  extended  the  scope  of  the  relief  from  Stamp  Duty provided  under  the  Stamp  Duty  Ordinance  (the  SDO)  in  respect  of  stock borrowing and lending transactions.    Stamp Office Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 2 (Revised) explains how the Collector of Stamp Revenue interprets the relevant SDO provisions. As several of the terms used in section 15E of the Ordinance are defined by reference to the corresponding terms in the SDO, this Practice Note should be read and construed in conjunction with the Stamp Office Practice Notes.
3. It  should be noted that the ambit of section 15E has been extended since  it  was  introduced.    Originally  the  section  only  provided  Profits  Tax relief  in  respect  of  transactions  which  also  qualified  for  Stamp  Duty  relief, namely those concerning Hong Kong stock the sale and purchase of which in Hong  Kong  are  subject  to  the  rules  and  practices  of  the  Stock  Exchange  of Hong Kong. With the enactment of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 4) Ordinance  1996,  section  15E  was  amended  to  also  provide  relief,  with application  to  the  year  of  assessment  commencing  on  1  April  1996  and subsequent years of assessment, for transactions involving 'specified securities', i.e. securities specified by the Commissioner in accordance with the definition of the term in section 15E(8) of the Ordinance.

## TRANSACTIONS TO WHICH SECTION 15E APPLIES

4. In broad terms, section 15E is concerned with what are in substance stock  loans,  even  though  transactions  are  involved  which  have  the  effect  of

transferring the legal title to stock between the relevant parties. In this regard, the  Department  accepts  that  there  are  two  main  categories  of  transactions which  come  within  the  scope  of  section  15E,  namely,  stock  borrowing  and lending  transactions  (SBLTs)  and  repurchase  transactions  (Repos).    Each category is discussed in further detail below.

### SBLTs

5. An  SBLT  is  typically  initiated  by  a  person  who  seeks  to  borrow stock  (the  borrower)  from  a  person  who  has  such  stock  (the  lender).    The borrower  is  generally  either  (i)  a  short  seller  (see  note 1 )  who  has  to  deliver stock  sold  short  to  a  purchaser  (or  a  securities  dealer  acting  on  behalf  of  its customer who has sold short); (ii) a securities dealer covering 'fails' to deliver stock by customers; or (iii) an intermediary, typically a securities dealer, who would on-lend the stock borrowed (e.g. the borrower locates stock and on-lends it  to  a  person  who  could  not  locate  it  directly;  in  other  words,  the  initial borrower 'intermediates' between  the initial lender and the subsequent borrower).
6. Under  an  SBLT,  the  lender  transfers  the legal and  beneficial ownership  of  the  borrowed  stock  to  the  borrower. The  lender  loses  legal ownership rights (including the right to vote) in exchange for collateral from the borrower (usually cash, but can be debt or equity securities). Title to the collateral  passes  from  the  borrower  to  the  lender. The  borrower  agrees  to return stock equivalent to the borrowed stock to the lender upon the lender's demand or within a certain period of time, at which time the lender returns the collateral  to  the  borrower.    The  lender  remains  entitled  to  the  economic benefits (and risk of loss) of the stock during the period the stock is lent (i.e. the  'borrowing  period'). If  either  party  becomes  insolvent,  the  other  party may retain the borrowed stock or collateral as the case may be.
7. Various payments and distributions of property can be made under an  SBLT. The  lender  generally  receives  a  fee  ('borrowing  fee')  from  the borrower  in  respect  of  the  borrowed  stock.    In  addition,  if  any  interest, dividend or other distribution is made in respect of the borrowed stock during

By virtue of s.170 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571) which requires a seller of securities  to  have a  presently  exercisable  and  unconditional  right  to vest  the  securities  in  the purchaser of them, a short seller must first obtain a stock borrowing facility by entering into a stock borrowing and lending agreement with a stock lender. 1

the borrowing period, the lender receives from the borrower the distribution (or identical property) or a compensatory payment, sometimes called a 'manufactured dividend' if paid in place of a dividend, equal to the value of the distribution.

8. In the other direction, if the borrower provides cash to the lender as collateral, the lender will pay the borrower a so-called 'loan rebate fee' which is generally calculated with reference to published inter-bank interest rates. If the borrower instead furnishes non-cash collateral to the lender, then, depending  upon  the  agreement  between  the  parties,  the  lender  will  pay  the borrower compensatory payments in respect of distributions made in relation to the non-cash collateral (or pass on the actual distributions) or the borrower may substitute cash for the non-cash collateral prior to each distribution date so that the borrower receives the distributions directly.
9. Finally, payments of cash or transfers of non-cash collateral can be made  between  the  borrower  and  the  lender  (in  either  direction)  to  reflect variations  during  the  borrowing  period  in  the  value  of  the  borrowed  stock. Such payments/transfers are to ensure that the value of the collateral held by the  lender  continues  to  represent  the  same  proportion  of  the  value  of  the borrowed stock when the collateral was originally provided to the lender.

### Repos

10. In  economic  terms  Repos  are  very  similar  to  SBLTs. A  Repo  is typically initiated by a person (the seller) who has stock in the form of equity or  debt  securities  but  needs  cash  agreeing  to  sell  the  stock  to  a  person  (the buyer) who has the cash. At the same time the buyer agrees to sell equivalent stock to the seller at a later date, or on demand, at a price which is specified or is to be determined using a specified basis of calculation. A 'Reverse Repo' is essentially the same, but is initiated by a person (the buyer) who has cash and is  willing  to  exchange  it  for  securities. The  seller  in  a  Reverse  Repo  also agrees  to  repurchase  equivalent  stock  from  the  buyer. Repos  and  Reverse Repos  are  entered  into  for  purposes  of  (i)  liquidity  management  (i.e.  the exchange of cash for stock for a temporary period); (ii) intermediation; and (iii) at times, to cover short sales or 'fails' to deliver by customers.

11. As  with  an  SBLT,  the  seller  transfers  the  legal  and  beneficial ownership  of  the  debt  or  equity  securities  to  the  buyer.    If  either  party becomes insolvent, the other party may retain the purchased stock or cash, as the case may be.
12. Reflecting  the  practice  with  SBLTs,  the  seller  receives  from  the buyer  the  economic  benefit  of  any  distribution  made  in  respect  of  the  stock prior  to  repurchase,  i.e.  during  the  borrowing  period. Upon repurchase,  the initial seller pays the initial buyer the repurchase price in cash in exchange for the stock. The repurchase price includes a pre-determined premium, usually referred to as a 'price differential', which is generally based on the purchase price  paid  by  the  initial  buyer  and  calculated  with  reference  to  published inter-bank  interest  rates.    Other  factors  which  may  affect  the  amount  of  the price differential include the desirability or need for the securities involved, and whether the  securities  are  scripless  or  physical  (an  'inconvenience  payment' may be charged in the case of physical securities).
13. The cash paid by the buyer to the seller in exchange for stock under a Repo can be likened to the payment of collateral in the context of an SBLT. The cash paid may subsequently be increased or decreased to maintain the ratio of  the  purchase  price  paid  to  the  market  value  of  the  stock. For  the  same purpose,  'margin  securities'  may  be  transferred  between  the  seller  and  the buyer  (in  either  direction)  during  the  term  of  the  Repo. Such  payments  of cash  and  transfers  of  securities  are  analogous  to  the  increase  or  decrease  of collateral in the case of an SBLT.

### Conditions for relief

14. Section 15E only has application where conditions to the following effect laid down in section 15E(1) are satisfied:
- (a) the  'borrowed  stock'  obtained  under  a  stock  borrowing  and lending  agreement  (which  may  be  in  the  form  of  a  Repo agreement) was used by the borrower (buyer in the case of a Repo)  for  one  or  more  than  one  specified  purpose  (see paragraph  18  below),  and  has  effected  a  'stock  return'  as defined in section 19(16) of the SDO;
- (b) the borrower either passed on any distribution made in respect of  the  borrowed  stock  to  the  lender  or  provided  the  lender with a compensatory  payment  of equal value (e.g. the so-called 'manufactured dividend');
- (c) the lender did not dispose of the right to receive any part of the  total  consideration  payable  by  the  borrower  under  the stock borrowing and lending agreement;
- (d) both the borrower and lender were dealing with each other at arm's length; and
- (e) the  lender  did  not  enter  into  the  stock  borrowing  with  the purpose, or main  purpose,  of avoiding  or deferring the inclusion  of  any  amount  in  profits  in  respect  of  which  the lender is chargeable to Profits Tax.

### Types of securities

15. As  was  mentioned  in  paragraph  3  above,  relief  under  section  15E was originally only available in respect of transactions which also qualified for relief  under  the  SDO,  i.e.  those  involving  'Hong  Kong  stock  the  sale  and purchase of which in Hong Kong are subject to the rules and practices of the recognized  exchange  company  that  operates  the  relevant  stock  market'. However, with effect from the year of assessment commencing on 1 April 1996, relief under section 15E was extended to also apply in respect of transactions involving  'specified  securities'. The expression is defined in the  section  in the following terms-
2. ''specified securities' means any of the following, not being Hong Kong stock the sale and purchase of which in Hong Kong are subject to the rules and practices of a recognized stock market-
- (a) any  shares,  stocks,  debentures,  loan  stocks,  funds,  bonds  or notes of or issued by any body, whether corporate or unincorporate, or any government or local government authority, or any other similar investment of any description;
- (b) any units under a unit trust scheme;
- (c) any  right,  option  or  interest  in  or  in  respect  of  any  security referred to in paragraph (a) or (b),

which the Commissioner may specify in writing, either generally or in any particular case, for the purposes of this section.'

16. Pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  definition,  on  30  August  1996  the Commissioner specified, by means of Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 26, that where associated parties are not involved securities falling into the following categories are specified securities for the purposes of section 15E-
- (i) any debt or equity security listed on a stock exchange in Hong Kong or any other stock exchange or over-the-counter market recognized for the purposes of this paragraph by the Commissioner;
- (ii) any unlisted debt issued to third parties or guaranteed to third parties  by  listed  companies  (including  affiliates  owned  50% or more by listed companies);
- (iii) any  unlisted  sovereign  debt  (including,  for  this  purpose, government  agency  debt,  multilateral  agency  debt  and  debt guaranteed by multilateral agencies or sovereign governments); and
- (iv) any  unlisted  debt  or  equity  securities  issued  pursuant  to  a private  placement  authorized  by  the  Hong  Kong  Securities and  Futures  Commission  or  a  similar  supervisory  body  in another jurisdiction.
17. The categories of specified securities may change from time to time. Accordingly, reference should be made to Practice Notes No. 26 (Revised) to ascertain  the  current  position,  or  to  the  Department  if  there  is  any  doubt  in relation to a particular situation. The Practice Note also provides information concerning  the  circumstances  where  associated  parties  are  considered  to  be involved.

### Specified purposes

18. For  the  purposes  of  section  15E,  the  term  'specified  purpose'  is defined in section 15E(8) to have, subject to section 15E(9), the same meaning as in the SDO. The SDO definition is contained in section 19(16) and is as follows:

''specified  purpose',  in  relation  to  the  borrowing  of  stock  by  any person, means-

- (a) the settling of a sale of Hong Kong stock wherever effected, whether by the person himself or another person;
- (b) the  settling  of  a  future  sale  of  Hong  Kong  stock,  whether agreed  or  not  when  such  stock  borrowing  is  effected  and whether by the person himself or another person;
- (c) the  replacement,  in  whole  or  in  part,  of  Hong  Kong  stock obtained by the person under another stock borrowing;
- (d) the on-lending of the stock borrowed to another person who effects a stock borrowing in respect of such stock on-lent; or
- (e) such  other  purpose  as  the  Collector  may,  in  writing,  allow either generally or in any particular case.'

Section 15E(9) widens the meaning of the definition for Profits Tax purposes by providing that, so far as is relevant, any reference to Hong Kong stock in the SDO  definition  is  to  be  construed  as  including  a  reference  to  specified securities.

19. To cater for the purpose for which the majority of Repos are entered into, the Collector accepts, under the authority provided in paragraph (e) of the SDO  definition,  that  stock  obtained  by  a  buyer  for  the  purpose  of  liquidity management is for a 'specified  purpose'  (see  paragraphs  40  to  42  of  Stamp Office Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 2 (Revised)).

## COLLATERAL SECURITIES

20. As was pointed out earlier, the provision of collateral is an integral part of SBLTs (from the borrower to the lender) and Repos (from the buyer to the  seller). While  cash  is  typically  used  in  the  case  of  Repos,  SBLTs  may involve the transfer of stock from the borrower to the lender as collateral, with the borrower remaining entitled to the economic benefits of the stock, and the re-transfer of this stock back to the borrower at the end of the borrowing period. Provided that this  is  the  case  and  the  SBLT  itself  is  for  a  specified  purpose, then the transfers of the collateral (i.e. both from and back to the borrower) and the passing on of any distributions or making of any compensatory payments in respect of the collateral will be treated for tax purposes in an identical manner as those in relation to the original SBLT transaction (i.e. the stock loan which necessitated the stock collateral in the first place). In short, the provision of collateral securities to the lender and the subsequent re-transfer to the borrower can  be  regarded  as  constituting  a  reverse  SBLT  which  falls  within  the provisions of section 15E.

## TAXATION TREATMENT

21. The  Profits  Tax  treatment  of  the  more  common  property  transfers and  payments  associated  with  stock  borrowing  and  lending  agreements  is discussed in the following paragraphs.

### Borrowed stock

22. Section 15E(2) sets out the position of the lender (seller in the case of a Repo), other than in respect of the borrowing fee (see paragraph 25 below), under a stock borrowing and lending agreement in relation to the transactions by which stock is transferred from the lender to the borrower (from the seller to the  buyer  in  the  case  of  a  Repo)  and  subsequently  the  transactions  by  which stock of the same description or any reasonable equivalent is transferred back. In  essence,  the  subsection  provides  that,  to  the  extent  that  a  stock  return  is made  in  respect  of  the  borrowed  stock,  the  lender  is  treated  as  if  the  stock borrowing and stock return had not been made and as having held the borrowed stock during the relevant borrowing period.

23. Accordingly, the lender is to disregard any chargeable profit (apart from  the  borrowing  fee)  which  would  otherwise  arise  in  respect  of  both  the disposal of the stock to the borrower and the subsequent re-acquisition. It also follows that a lender who normally values stock for accountancy purposes at current market value should continue to value the borrowed stock in this way during  the  borrowing  period. As such,  where  the  borrowing  period  bridges the end of an accounting period the difference between the opening value and the value at the end of the accounting period should be recorded by the lender, subject to source principles, as a profit or loss, as the case may be, for Profits Tax purposes.
24. As  regards  the  borrower,  the  disposal  of  borrowed  stock  for  a specified purpose in the normal course of a business carried on in Hong Kong will give rise to a profit or loss. The subsequent disposal of replacement stock to  the  lender  will  similarly  give  rise  to  a  profit  or  loss. In  calculating  the profit  or  loss,  section  15E(5)  provides  in  effect  that  the  market  value  of  the borrowed stock at the time of the borrowing is to be taken both as the cost of the borrowed stock and as the sale price of the replacement stock. Subject to source principles, the profits will be taxed or losses allowed.

### Borrowing fees

25. The fee payable by the borrower to the lender in respect of a stock borrowing is in the nature of a service fee and is treated as income in the hands of the lender and as expense for the borrower.    General principles determine whether the fee is chargeable or deductible for Profits Tax purposes, as the case may be.

### Actual distributions in respect of borrowed stock

26. Section 15E(3) provides in effect that where a lender receives from a borrower in relation to borrowed stock a distribution, right, option or identical property (i.e. the 'distribution' is passed on by the borrower to the lender), the lender  is  treated  for  tax  purposes  as  if  the  distribution  had  been  received directly by the lender in respect of a continued holding of the borrowed stock. Accordingly, the nature of the distribution will determine its taxability. For example,  a  dividend  would  be  exempt,  whilst  the  chargeability  of  interest would depend on matters such as its source and whether special provisions of

the  Ordinance  apply  to  the  recipient.    The  tax  treatment  of  the  amount received  by  the  lender  therefore  is  not  affected  by  the  fact  that  it  has  come other than from the issuer of the stock; it is treated as having the same nature and source for tax purposes as the original distribution.

27. With  regard  to  the  borrower,  where  a  distribution  is  received  in respect  of  borrowed  stock  (e.g.  if  the  borrower  is  still  holding  the  borrowed stock at the time a distribution is made) and it is then passed on to the lender (or a payment of equal value is made to the lender), the receipt and subsequent action are in effect ignored for Profits Tax purposes. In other words, as far as the borrower is concerned, receipt of the actual distribution does not give rise to  any  chargeable  profit  and  the  subsequent  passing  on  of  it,  or  payment  of equal value, to the lender does not create an allowable deduction.

### Compensatory payments

28. Section  15E(4)  applies  where  the  borrower  has  not  received  the actual  distribution  and  has  therefore  made  a  payment  of  equal  value  (a compensatory payment) to the lender. This is the more likely circumstance as a borrower would not generally continue to hold the borrowed stock, but would instead  deliver  it  to  a  purchaser  in  respect  of  a  short  sale  or  on-lend  it  to  a subsequent  borrower.    This  subsection  again  puts  the  lender  in  the  same taxation  position  as  would  have  been  the  case  if  the  lender  had  retained ownership of the borrowed stock and received the original distribution. The nature  of  the  original  distribution  will  determine  the  tax  treatment  of  the compensatory payment in the hands of the lender.
29. Section 15E does not address the position of the borrower in relation to  compensatory  payments.    Accordingly,  the  question  of  deductibility  is determined  under  sections  16  and  17  of  the  Ordinance,  i.e.  the  amount  will qualify  for  deduction  if  it  can  be  characterized  as  an  outgoing  or  expense incurred by the borrower in the production of profits which are chargeable to Profits Tax and is not of a capital nature.
30. The above principles also apply in relation to compensatory payments made by the lender to the borrower in respect of a reverse SBLT, i.e. for distributions on collateral securities provided by the borrower to the lender under the terms of the stock borrowing and lending agreement.

### Loan rebate fees and price differentials

31. A loan rebate fee in relation to an SBLT is payable by a lender to a borrower when cash collateral is given by the borrower to the lender in respect of the borrowed stock. The fee is generally calculated with reference to the amount of cash involved, inter-bank interest  rates  and  the  length  of  time  the cash collateral is held by the lender. Similarly, a price differential in relation to  a  Repo  (included  in  the  repurchase  price  paid  by  the  initial  seller  to  the initial buyer) is usually calculated with reference to the purchase price paid by the initial buyer, inter-bank interest rates and the length of time the cash is held by the initial seller. Thus, rebate fees and price differentials are considered to be, in substance, interest and are treated accordingly.
32. Reflecting the conditions governing the deductibility of interest laid down in section 16(2) of the Ordinance, a loan rebate fee or price differential paid by a lender to an overseas counterparty not carrying on business in Hong Kong  will  not  generally  qualify  for  deduction  unless  the  recipient  is  an overseas  financial  institution  as  defined  in  section  16(3).    However,  in practice  the  Department  will  accept  that  where  the  recipient  is  acting  as  a principal and is a securities dealing and underwriting firm regulated in at least one  overseas  jurisdiction  by  a  supervisory  body  similar  to  the  Hong  Kong Securities  and  Futures  Commission,  it  can  be  recognized  as  an  overseas financial institution for the purposes of sections 15E and 16(2). Recognition will also be granted if the recipient is an affiliate owned 50% or more, directly or indirectly, by such a securities firm.

## ASSESSMENTS

33. Where  a  person  has  entered  into  a  stock  borrowing  and  lending agreement and at the close of the year of assessment not all transactions under the agreement have taken place (e.g. a stock return has not been made because the borrowing period has not finished), the Assessor can, by virtue of section 15E(6), raise  the  assessment  for  the  year  concerned  on  the  basis  that  section 15E is applicable. If it is subsequently found that the section is not applicable, the assessment can be adjusted accordingly under section 15E(7).

## ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

34. The taxation treatment of property transfers and cash flows associated with stock borrowing and lending agreements reflects the Department's  understanding  of  generally  accepted  accounting  practice  in relation  to  such  agreements. Briefly,  the  Department  understands  that  the following conventions would generally apply:
- the  lender  (seller  in  the  case  of  a  Repo)  continues  to  reflect the  borrowed  stock  (securities  subject  to  repurchase  in  the case of a Repo) as an asset on its balance sheet;
- the borrower (buyer in the case of a Repo) continues to reflect the  collateral  given  to  the  lender  as  an  asset  on  its  balance sheet;
- if either the borrowed stock or collateral is normally valued at current market value, then the party reflecting the asset on its balance sheet will include either income or loss, as the case may  be,  in  its  profit  and  loss  statement  in  respect  of  any difference  in  values  between  the  beginning  and  end  of  the period;
- if actual distributions are received by the borrower and passed on to the lender (as opposed to the  borrower  making compensatory payments in respect of distributions not received), the receipt and passing on of such distributions will not be reflected in the borrower's profit and loss statement;
- compensatory payments in respect of distributions are reflected  as  expenses  in  the  profit  and  loss  statement  of  the borrower and as income in the profit and loss statement of the lender;
- borrowing fees are reflected as expenses in the profit and loss statement of the borrower and as income in the profit and loss statement of the lender; and

- loan rebate fees (price differential payments in the case of a Repo) are reflected as interest expenses in the profit and loss statement  of  the  lender  and  as  interest  receipts  in  the  profit and loss statement of the borrower.

If  the  accounting  treatment  in  any  particular  case  differs  from  the  general understanding set out above, and the matter is not self-evident from the notes to the  accounts,  this  must  be  drawn  to the  Assessor's  attention  in  the  tax computation submitted.

35. This Practice Note has been prepared with regard to the fact that the relevant legislation was introduced with a view to promoting the development of  Hong  Kong  as  a  major  financial  centre.    The  positions  taken  by  the Department are generally intended to be consistent with the substance of the transactions involved and their treatment within the industry. Consequently, this Practice Note should not impose undue restrictions on the parties ordinarily engaged  in  SBLT  and  Repo  businesses. At  the  same  time,  the  Department will  not  accept  that  its  contents  can  in  any  way  restrict  action  to  counter  tax avoidance. This  Practice  Note  will  be  reviewed  in  the  light  of  experience. Should situations encountered so dictate, changes will be effected.
