## BACKGROUND

### Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme

The Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS) is a policy initiative implemented by the Food and Health Bureau (FHB) for maintaining the long-term sustainability  of  the  healthcare  system. It  is  implemented  through  a  nonlegislative framework to regulate individual indemnity hospital insurance products, with voluntary participation by insurance companies and consumers.    The VHIS seeks to improve the quality of individual indemnity hospital insurance products and offer consumers a more comprehensive quality choice of such products.    By improving  the  accessibility,  quality  and  transparency  of  individual  indemnity hospital  insurance  products,  the  VHIS  enhances  consumers'  confidence  in purchasing such products for using private healthcare services, thereby alleviating the pressure on the public healthcare system.

2. Individual indemnity hospital insurance refers to an insurance where the insured  will  be  reimbursed  or  indemnified  by  the  insurer  for  actual  expenses incurred  for  medical  treatments  in  a  hospital  or  an  ambulatory  setting.    Other health-related  insurance  products  (e.g.  non-indemnity  critical  illness  insurance, hospital income/ cash plans, dental insurance coverage, outpatient insurance plans) are not covered by the VHIS.
3. The FHB has established a VHIS Office to certify individual indemnity hospital insurance products that are in compliance with the VHIS rules (Certified Plans).    Insurance companies seeking to offer VHIS-compliant products must first register  as  a  VHIS  Provider  and  the  products  must  be  certified  by  the  FHB  as Certified Plans.    There are two types of Certified Plans:
- (a) the Standard Plan which provides a standardized basic protection (e.g. benefit limits for room and board at ward class) according to the minimum requirements of the VHIS prescribed by the FHB; and
- (b) Flexi Plans which provide enhanced protection compared with the  Standard  Plan  (e.g.  higher  room  and  board  benefit  limits, wider benefit coverage with less restriction for  enhanced protection).
4. In addition to the Standard Plan that must be made available for new applications, VHIS Providers are allowed and encouraged to offer Flexi Plans that provide top-up protection.    They must also provide the existing policy holders of individual indemnity hospital insurance an opportunity to switch to a Certified Plan.
5. Compared with many existing individual indemnity hospital insurance products,  the  Standard  Plan  and  the  basic  coverage  of  Flexi  Plans  have  the following product features which are more attractive to the policy holders and the insured:
- (a) standard  policy  terms  and  conditions,  benefit  coverage  and benefit amount;
- (b) guaranteed renewal up to the age of 100 (without reunderwriting);
- (c) no lifetime benefit limit;
- (d) cooling-off period of 21 days during which the policy holders can cancel the policies with full refund of premium;
- (e) premium transparency; and
- (f) coverage extended to include unknown pre-existing conditions, treatment of congenital conditions, day case procedures, prescribed  advanced  diagnostic  imaging  tests,  prescribed  nonsurgical cancer treatments, psychiatric treatment, etc.
6. The FHB has published the following VHIS scheme documents, setting out the scheme rules with which VHIS Providers must comply:
- (a) VHIS  Certified  Plan  Policy  Template which  illustrates  the minimum  requirements  on  the  policy  structure,  terms  and benefits of Certified Plans under the VHIS;
- (b) Code of Practice for Insurance Companies under the Ambit of the VHIS which sets out the required conduct and practices for VHIS Providers; and
- (c) Product Compliance Rules under the Ambit of the VHIS which sets out the product design requirements for an insurance plan to be certified as VHIS  compliant  and  the  relevant product certification procedure.

The VHIS scheme documents can be accessed at the website of the FHB for VHIS (www.vhis.gov.hk). Lists  of  VHIS  Providers  and  Certified  Plans  will  be published and regularly updated.

### The Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 8) Ordinance 2018

7. The Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 8) Ordinance 2018 amended the Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  (the  Ordinance)  to  introduce  the  concessionary deduction concerning salaries tax and tax under personal assessment that may be allowed  for  premiums  paid  in  respect  of  insurance  plans  certified  to  be  in compliance  with  the  VHIS  (i.e.  Certified  Plans)  with  effect  from  the  year  of assessment 2019/20.    The main provisions are as follows:
- (a) Section 26H provides for the application of Division 6.
- (b) Sections 26I and 26J provide for the interpretation of terms used in  Division  6  of  Part  4A,  including  qualifying  premiums, specified relative and VHIS policy.
- (c) Section 26K provides for the deduction allowable for qualifying premiums paid by a taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse (not being a spouse living apart from the taxpayer) as a policy holder of a VHIS policy for an insured person.    In order for the deduction to  be  allowable,  the  insured  person  must  be  the  taxpayer  or  a specified  relative  of  the  taxpayer  in  the  year  of  assessment. Also, either of the following conditions must be satisfied:
    - (i) the insured person is a holder of Hong Kong identity card (HKID  card  holder)  at  any  time  during  the  year  of assessment;
    - (ii) if the insured person is under the age of 11 and not an HKID  card  holder-a  natural  parent  (or  an  adoptive parent) of the insured person is an HKID card holder at the time of birth (or adoption) of the insured person.

Section 26K also provides that if there is more than one policy holder for a VHIS policy, the qualifying premiums are taken as paid by all of the policy holders in equal shares.    The maximum deduction  allowable  to  a  taxpayer  in  respect  of  qualifying premiums paid for each insured person is specified in Schedule 3E.

- (d) Section  26L  deals  with  claims  for  deduction  in  respect  of  the qualifying premiums paid by a married person or the person's spouse or both of them.    It provides for the related arrangement and  the  related  power  to  make  additional  assessments,  for handling excessive claims made by married couples.
- (e) Section 26M provides for requirements in relation to the refund of  qualifying  premiums  paid.    For  any  refund,  the  qualifying premiums  paid  are  taken  to  be  reduced  by  the  amount  of  the refund.    Moreover, if the refund is made after the claim of the deduction,  the  person  claiming  the  deduction  must  notify  the Commissioner in writing of the refund within 3 months after the date of refund.    It also provides that despite any time limit under section 60, an additional assessment under that section may be made if the deduction claimed has been allowed.
8. The purpose of this Departmental Interpretation and Practice Note is to set  out  in  detail  the  Department's  views  and  practices  on  the  concessionary deduction in relation to the health insurance premiums paid under the VHIS.

## THE CONCESSIONARY DEDUCTION

### Conditions for deduction

9. Section 26K provides that a deduction in respect of qualifying premiums paid for an insured person under a VHIS policy is allowable to a taxpayer.    The conditions for the deduction are:
- (a) only  qualifying  premiums  in  relation  to  a  VHIS  policy  are eligible for deduction;
- (b) premium was paid in the year of assessment;
- (c) payment was made by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse (not being a spouse living apart) as a policy holder of a VHIS policy;
- (d) the insured person is the taxpayer or a specified relative of the taxpayer in the year of assessment;
- (e) the insured person is an HKID card holder at any time during the year of assessment or a natural/ adoptive parent of the insured person (who is under the age 11) is an HKID card holder at the time of birth/ adoption of the insured person;
- (f) premiums paid by policy holders are apportioned in equal shares;
- (g) deduction allowable to a taxpayer for each insured person cannot exceed the maximum specified amount;
- (h) total deduction allowed to a married couple cannot exceed the premiums paid; and
- (i) qualifying  premiums  should  be  commensurate  with  the  risk profile of the insured person.

### Qualifying premiums

10. Only qualifying premiums in relation to a VHIS policy are eligible for deduction.    'VHIS policy' means an insurance policy that is in whole or in part issued under an insurance plan certified by the Secretary for Food and Health to be in compliance with the VHIS (i.e. Certified Plan).    'Qualifying premiums' means the net sum of moneys that is payable under a VHIS policy to the insurer for writing or renewing the policy in so far as it relates to a Certified Plan.    For a consumer who has purchased an insurance policy issued under a Certified Plan together with elements  of  other  insurance  plans  (e.g.  an  accident  insurance,  life  coverage  or hospital cash plan), only the net sum of moneys payable in respect of the Certified Plan is considered as qualifying premiums of the VHIS policy.

**Example 1**

Mr. A purchased a VHIS policy which comprised a Certified Plan and a life  insurance  plan.    Premiums  payable  for  the  VHIS  policy  were $10,000 ($7,000 for the Certified Plan and $3,000 for the life insurance plan).    Mr. A paid the premium annually and was given a 5% premium discount.

Net premiums of $6,650 (i.e. $7,000 × 95%) paid for the Certified Plan would qualify for deduction.    Net premiums paid for the life insurance plan would not be deductible.

### Premiums paid during a year of assessment

11. Deduction is only allowed for qualifying premiums actually paid in a year of assessment.    So long as the payment is made within the year of assessment, subject  to  the  other  qualifying  conditions  being  satisfied,  the  premiums  are deductible.    Premiums  due  in  a  year  of  assessment  but  paid  next  year  is  only deductible  in  the  year  of  payment. In  practice,  premium  receipt  or  annual premium statement issued by the insurers may be provided as proof of payment.

**Example 2**

Ms. B purchased a VHIS policy with quarterly payments of premiums due on 30 June 2019, 30 September 2019, 30 December 2019 and 30 March 2020.    Ms. B made the four premium payments on 30 June 2019, 1 October 2019, 31 December 2019 and 2 April 2020 respectively.

For  the  year  of  assessment  2019/20,  deduction  would  be  granted  in respect  of  premiums  paid  on  30  June  2019,  1  October  2019  and  31 December 2019.    The premium due on 30 March 2020 (i.e. within the year of assessment 2019/20) but paid on 2 April 2020 (i.e. within the year  of  assessment  2020/21)  would  be  deductible  for  the  year  of assessment 2020/21.

### Payment made by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse as policy holder

12. Section 26K(1)(a) provides that payment for the qualifying premiums must be made by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse, not being a spouse living

apart from the taxpayer, as a policy holder of a VHIS policy.    In other words, for married  couples  not  living  apart,  a  spouse  may  claim  deduction  for  qualifying premiums paid by the other spouse as a policy holder.    'Policy holder', in relation to a VHIS policy, means a legal holder of the policy.

**Example 3**

Mr. C was the policy holder of a VHIS policy that was in whole issued under a Certified Plan with his father as the insured person.    On 5 April 2019, Mr. C made an annual premium payment of $8,000 for the policy period from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020.    On 1 January 2020, Mr. C passed away and the ownership of the VHIS policy was transferred to Mr. D who was the brother of Mr. C.

For  the  year  of  assessment  2019/20,  Mr.  C  would  be  granted  full deduction of the qualifying premium of $8,000 since the premium was paid by Mr. C at the time when he was the policy holder and the payment was made within that year of assessment.    On the other hand, Mr. D would  not  be  allowed  any  deduction  even  though  he  was  the  policy holder for the period from 1 January to 31 March 2020 since he did not pay any qualifying premium during that period.

**Example 4**

Mr. E and Ms. F were husband and wife.    Mr. E was the policy holder of  a  VHIS  policy  with  Ms.  F  as  the  insured  person.    Mr.  E  paid qualifying premiums of $7,200 for the policy period from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020.    Deduction for the premiums paid was claimed by Ms. F.    Mr. E and Ms. F became separated on 15 August 2019.

Scenario 1: Mr. E made an annual premium payment of $7,200 on 1 April 2019.

Scenario 2: Mr. E made monthly premium payments of $600 on the first day of each month.

#### Scenario 1

Mr. E was not living apart from Ms. F at the time when the premium payment was made.    Ms.  F  would  be  granted  full  deduction  for  the premiums of $7,200 paid by Mr. E.

#### Scenario 2

Ms. F would only be granted deduction for the monthly premiums paid from April to August 2019 (before the date of separation on 15 August 2019) in the total amount of $3,000 (i.e. $600 × 5).    Ms. F would not be allowed deduction for the remaining balance of $4,200, which was paid after separation from Mr. E.

### Insured being the taxpayer or a specified relative

#### Insured person

13. 'Insured  person',  in  relation  to  a  VHIS  policy,  means  an  individual whose  risks  are  covered  by  the  policy.    Section  26K(1)(b)  provides  that  the insured person must be the taxpayer or a specified relative of the taxpayer in the year  of  assessment. Section  26J(1)  defines  'specified  relative'  to  mean  an individual who is, at any time during the year of assessment, the taxpayer's spouse or children, and the taxpayer's or the spouse's parents, grandparents or siblings. These types of familial relationships are the same as the relationships covered by the existing dependent allowances under Part 5 of the Ordinance.

#### Spouse

14. In section 2(1) of the Ordinance, 'spouse' is defined to mean a husband or wife whereas 'husband' and 'wife' refer to a married man and married woman respectively.    'Marriage' is also defined in the same section to mean:
- (a) any marriage recognized by the law of Hong Kong; or
- (b) any marriage, whether or not so recognized, entered into outside Hong Kong according to the law of the place where it was entered into and between persons having the capacity to do so.

Based  on  the  above  definitions,  'marriage'  was  in  the  past  construed  as  a heterosexual  marriage  between  a  man  and  a  woman  and  parties  in  a  same-sex marriage would be incapable of having a 'spouse'.

15. In Leung  Chun  Kwong  v  Secretary  for  the  Civil  Service (2019)  22 HKCFAR 127, the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) recognized that the protection of the institution of marriage in Hong Kong, being heterosexual and monogamous,

was a legitimate aim.    However, the differential treatment under the Ordinance between a person in a heterosexual marriage and a person in a same-sex marriage entered into outside Hong Kong was not rationally connected to the legitimate aim and  was  not  justified. As  a  relief,  the  CFA  considered  that  a  remedial interpretation  of  the  Ordinance  was  appropriate  and  ordered  the  following declaration:

- (a) the existing limb (b) of the term 'marriage' in section 2 of the Ordinance  shall  be  read  as  'any  marriage,  whether  or  not  so recognized, entered into outside Hong Kong according to the law of  the  place  where  it  was  entered  into  and  between  persons having the capacity to do so, provided where the persons are of the same sex and such a marriage between them would have been a marriage under this Ordinance but for the fact only that they are  persons  of  the  same  sex,  they  shall  be  deemed  for  the purposes of such a marriage to have the capacity to do so'; and
- (b) for the purposes of the Ordinance, references to:
    - (i) 'husband and wife' shall be read as 'a married person and his or her spouse';
    - (ii) 'not being a wife living apart from her husband' shall be read as 'not being a spouse living apart from the married person'; and
    - (iii) 'either the husband or wife' shall be read as 'either the married person or his or her spouse'.

Therefore, a taxpayer, whether in a heterosexual marriage or same-sex marriage, is entitled to claim deduction in respect of the premiums paid by the taxpayer for the taxpayer's spouse.

16. The definition of 'marriage' shall not, in the case of a marriage which is both potentially and actually polygamous, include marriage between a person and any spouse other than the principal spouse.    If a person has more than one legal spouse under the laws of other places which permit polygamous marriage, only the marriage  between  the  person  and  the  principal  spouse  is  recognized  for  the purposes of the Ordinance.    Deduction is only allowed in respect of the qualifying premiums paid by a taxpayer for the principal spouse.

17. If  a  taxpayer  is  living  apart  from  the  spouse,  deduction  in  respect  of qualifying premiums paid for the spouse is allowable so long as their marriage has not been dissolved.    If a divorce occurs in a year of assessment (year of divorce), the full amount of premiums paid for the ex-spouse during the year of divorce is allowable for deduction.    Any premium paid for the ex-spouse after the year of divorce is not deductible.

**Example 5**

Same  facts  as  in  Example  4  with  changes. Mr.  E  and  Ms.  F subsequently  got  divorced  on  15  March  2020.    Deduction  for  the qualifying premiums of $7,200 paid for Ms. F was claimed by Mr. E.

Ms. F was Mr. E's spouse during the period from 1 April 2019 to 14 March 2020.    Therefore, she was a specified relative of Mr. E in the year of assessment 2019/20.    As such, Mr. E would be entitled to claim full deduction for the premiums of $7,200 paid for Ms. F (whether by annual payment or monthly payments) during that year of assessment. If  Mr. E continued to pay the qualifying premium on or after 1 April 2020, no deduction would be allowed since Ms. F was no longer his specified relative starting from the year of assessment 2020/21.

#### Parent and grandparent

18. 'Parent' means a natural, adoptive or step father or mother of a taxpayer or the taxpayer's living or deceased spouse; whilst 'grandparent' means a natural, adoptive or step grandfather or grandmother of a taxpayer or the taxpayer's living or deceased spouse.    The parent or grandparent must, at any time during the year of assessment, fulfill one of the following conditions:
- (a) aged 55 or more; or
- (b) under the age of 55 but eligible to claim an allowance under the Government's Disability Allowance Scheme.

#### Child

19. 'Child'  means  a  child  of  a  taxpayer  or  the  spouse  or  former  spouse whether or not born in wedlock and includes the adopted or step child of either or

both  of  them.    The  child  must  be,  at  any  time  during  the  year  of  assessment, unmarried and fulfill one of the following conditions:

- (a) under the age of 18;
- (b) aged 18 or more but under the age of 25 and receiving full time education  at  a  university, college,  school  or  other  similar educational establishment; or
- (c) aged 18 or more but incapacitated for work by reason of physical or mental disability.

#### Sibling

20. 'Sibling' means a full blood, half blood, adopted or step sibling of a taxpayer  or  the  taxpayer's  living  or  deceased  spouse.    If  the  taxpayer  or  the taxpayer's living or deceased spouse is adopted, the definition of 'sibling' includes a natural child of an adoptive parent of either of them.    The sibling must be, at any time  during  the  year  of  assessment,  unmarried  and  fulfill  one  of  the  three conditions as stated in paragraph 1 9 above.

#### Adopted

21. 'Adopted'  means  adopted  in  any  manner  recognized  by  the  laws  of Hong Kong.    With effect  from  the  implementation  of  the Adoption  Ordinance (Cap. 290) on 1 January 1973, an adoption order validating the adoption must be made under that Ordinance while adoptions made under Chinese law and custom prior to 1 January 1973 are also recognized.    For an overseas adoption, it would be considered in accordance with section 17 or 20F of the Adoption Ordinance, having regard to the individual circumstances of the case.

### Insured or parent being an HKID card holder

22. The insured person must be a holder of an identity card issued under the Registration  of  Persons  Ordinance  (Cap.  177)  at  any  time  during  the  year  of assessment.    If the insured person is under the age of 11 and not an HKID card holder, a natural parent or an adoptive parent of the insured person must be an HKID card holder at the time of birth or adoption of the insured person.    This requirement serves to ensure that the tax incentive is provided for people who have

a  nexus  to  Hong  Kong  (i.e.  the  target  group  that  the  Government  wishes  to encourage to purchase hospital insurance products and consider shifting from using public  hospital  services  to  private  healthcare  services).    For  the  avoidance  of doubt,  the  requirement  is  only  applicable  for  the  purpose  of  tax  deduction. Insurers are free to sell Certified Plans to consumers (be they policy holders or insured persons) with or without HKID cards.

**Example 6**

Mrs. G, a resident of Jurisdiction-F, purchased a VHIS policy in Hong Kong for her daughter aged 8 for the policy period from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020.    Monthly premium payments of $500 were made on the first day of each month.    Neither Mrs. G nor her husband, Mr. G, was an HKID card holder at the time of birth of the daughter.    On 1 May 2019, Mrs. G took up an employment in Hong Kong and obtained an HKID card.

Scenario 1: Mrs. G's daughter was not an HKID card holder at any time during the year of assessment 2019/20.

Scenario 2: Mrs. G's daughter obtained an HKID card on 15 March 2020.

#### Scenario 1

Even though Mrs. G became an HKID card holder on 1 May 2019, she would not be allowed deduction for the premiums paid for her daughter because neither Mr. G nor Mrs. G was an HKID card holder at the time when the daughter was born.

#### Scenario 2

Mrs. G's daughter became an HKID card holder sometime during the year of assessment 2019/20.    Mrs. G would be granted full deduction for the premiums of $6,000 paid for her daughter.

### Apportionment of premiums paid

23. Section 26K(2) provides that if there is more than one policy holder for a VHIS policy, the qualifying premiums paid for each insured person under the policy are taken as paid by all of the policy holders in equal shares.

**Example 7**

Mr. H and Ms. I, who were brother and sister, purchased a VHIS policy for their parents.    They paid as the policy holders qualifying premiums of $10,000 for the father and $12,000 for the mother in the proportion of 6 to 4.

Premiums for the father and mother would be taken as having been paid by Mr. H and Ms. I equally, irrespective of their actual contributions. Allowable deduction would be computed as follows:

| Taxpayer and policy holder   | Insured person   | Actual contribution $   | Allowable deduction $   |
|------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Mr. H                        | Father Mother    | 6,000 (60%) 7,200 (60%) | 5,000 (50%) 6,000 (50%) |
| Ms. I                        | Father Mother    | 4,000 (40%) 4,800 (40%) | 5,000 (50%) 6,000 (50%) |

### Maximum allowable deduction

24. Regarding the deduction for qualifying premiums, there is no cap on the number of:
- (a) specified relatives in respect of whom a taxpayer may claim tax deduction;
- (b) taxpayers who can make a claim for deduction of premiums for the same insured person; and
- (c) policies  per  insured  person  in  respect  of  which  taxpayers  can claim tax deduction.
25. Section  26K(3),  however,  provides  that  the  maximum  deduction allowable to a taxpayer in respect of qualifying premiums paid during a year of

assessment for each insured person, whether the insured person is insured under one or more than one VHIS policy, cannot exceed the amount specified in Schedule 3E to the Ordinance.    For the year of assessment 2019/20 and subsequent years, the  maximum  deduction  for  each  insured  person  is  $8,000  (subject  to  any subsequent  amendments). Qualifying  premiums  in  excess  of  the  statutory maximum deduction for any year will lapse.    The excess of premiums paid cannot be carried forward and claimed as deduction in any subsequent year of assessment.

**Example 8**

Mr.  J  purchased  one  VHIS  policy  for  himself  and  another  five  VHIS policies  for  his  specified  relatives.    Qualifying  premiums  were  paid during the year of assessment 2019/20 as follows:

| Insured person   | Premiums paid $   |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Mr. J            | 5,000             |
| Spouse           | 4,000             |
| Grandmother      | 16,000            |
| Father           | 12,000            |
| Mother           | 11,000            |
| Son              | 3,000             |
|                  | 51,000            |

Premiums paid in respect of  policies  for  the  grandmother,  father  and mother exceeded the cap of $8,000.    Assuming all the insured persons satisfied the conditions in section 26J, the amount of deduction would be $36,000 (i.e. $5,000 + $4,000 + ($8,000 × 3) + $3,000).    The excess of $15,000 ($51,000 -$36,000) paid would not be carried forward for deduction in subsequent years of assessment.

**Example 9**

Mr. K and Miss K were brother and sister.    They purchased eight VHIS policies  for  the  benefits  of  their  father,  mother  and  grandmother. Qualifying premiums were paid during the year of assessment 2019/20 as follows:

| Policy holder   | Policy   | Insured person   | Premiums paid $   |
|-----------------|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Mr. K           | No.1     | Father           | 3,000             |
|                 | No.2     | Father           | 3,000             |
|                 | No.3     | Mother           | 9,000             |
|                 | No.4     | Grandmother      | 8,000             |
|                 |          |                  | 23,000            |
|                 |          |                  | $                 |
| Miss K          | No.5     | Father           | 7,000             |
|                 | No.6     | Mother           | 5,000             |
|                 | No.7     | Mother           | 5,000             |
|                 | No.8     | Grandmother      | 10,000            |
|                 |          |                  | 27,000            |

Both Mr. K and Miss K would be entitled to claim deduction for the premiums paid for the same insured persons.    Deductions allowable to them would be computed as follows:

Mr. K

Premiums paid by Mr. K under Policy Nos.1 and 2 for the father in aggregate did not exceed the cap of $8,000.    Premiums paid by Mr. K under Policy No.3 for the mother exceeded the cap of $8,000 by $1,000. The amount of allowable deduction would be $22,000 (i.e. $23,000 -$1,000).

Miss K

Premiums paid by Miss K under Policy Nos.6 and 7 for the mother in aggregate exceeded the cap of $8,000 by $2,000.    Premiums paid by Miss  K  under  Policy  No.8  for  the  grandmother  exceeded  the  cap  of $8,000  by  $2,000.    The  amount  of  allowable  deduction  would  be $23,000 (i.e. $27,000 -$4,000).

### Premiums allowable to married persons

26. Where a deduction is claimed by a married person or the person's spouse or both in respect of the qualifying premiums paid by either or both of them for an insured person, the qualifying premiums paid are allowable as a deduction under section 26L(2) to either the married person or the person's spouse, or to both of them if:

- (a) the deduction allowed to each of them for the insured person does not exceed the maximum amount specified in Schedule 3E; and
- (b) the  total  deduction  allowed  to  them  does  not  exceed  the qualifying premiums paid.

**Example 10**

Mr. and Mrs. L were a married couple.    Mr. L purchased a VHIS policy for his mother and paid qualifying premium of $15,000 during the year of assessment 2019/20.

Scenario 1: Mrs. L had no income chargeable to tax.

Scenario 2: Both Mr. and Mrs. L had income chargeable to tax and they claimed deduction of $8,000 and $7,000 respectively.

#### Scenario 1

Deduction  allowable  to  Mr.  L  would  be  capped  at  $8,000. No deduction would be allowed to Mrs. L since Mrs. L did not have any salary income, property income or profits chargeable to tax under the Ordinance  against  which  the  unallowed  amount  of  $7,000  could  be claimed for deduction (i.e. Mr. L and Mrs. L would not be eligible to elect for joint assessment or personal assessment jointly).

#### Scenario 2

Deduction claims of Mr. and Mrs. L would be accepted.    Deduction allowed to each of them would not exceed the cap of $8,000 and total deduction would not exceed the premiums of $15,000 paid.

**Example 11**

Mr.  and  Mrs.  M  were  a  married  couple.    In  the  year  of  assessment 2019/20, while Mr. M purchased a VHIS policy for their son and paid qualifying premiums of $9,000, Mrs. M purchased another VHIS policy for their daughter and paid qualifying premiums of $12,000.    Both Mr. and Mrs. M had income chargeable to tax and they claimed for deduction of the premiums paid for the son and daughter as follows:

| Taxpayer   | Deduction claimed in respect of the son the daughter $ $   |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mr.M       | 8,000 4,000                                                |
| Mrs.M      | 1,000 8,000                                                |
|            | 9,000 12,000                                               |

Deductions  claimed  by  Mr.  and  Mrs.  M  in  respect  of  their  son  and daughter would be accepted.    Each deduction for the son and daughter would not exceed the cap of $8,000, and the total deductions would not exceed the premiums of $9,000 and $12,000 paid for them.

**Example 12**

Mr. and Mrs. N (husband and wife) and Mr. O and Miss P (son and daughter) were the holders of a VHIS policy with Mrs. N as the insured person.    Qualifying premiums of $24,000 were paid during the year of assessment 2019/20.    By virtue of the provisions in section 26K(2), the premiums would be taken to have been paid by Mr. and Mrs. N, Mr. O and  Miss  P  as  policy  holders  in  equal  shares  (i.e.  $6,000  would  be regarded as having been paid by each of them). Mr. and Mrs. N, Mr. O and Miss P claimed deductions for the premiums paid for Mrs. N as follows:

| Taxpayer and policy holder   | Premiums deemed paid $   | Deduction claimed $   |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| Mr. N                        | 6,000 (25%)              | 8,000                 |
| Mrs. N                       | 6,000 (25%)              | 4,000                 |
| Mr. O                        | 6,000 (25%)              | 8,000                 |
| Miss. P                      | 6,000 (25%)              | 6,000                 |
|                              | 24,000                   | 26,000                |

Claims  made  by  Mr.  and  Mrs.  N  would  be  accepted  since:  each deduction claimed would not exceed the cap of $8,000; and the total deduction of $12,000 would not exceed the premiums taken to have been paid by them.

Deduction allowable to Mr. O would be restricted to $6,000 (i.e.  the amount of premiums taken to have been paid by him).    The claim made by Miss. P would be accepted.

### Qualifying premiums commensurate with risk profile

27.          According to section 26K(4), if the Commissioner is of the opinion that the qualifying premiums paid for the insured person under a VHIS policy are not commensurate with the risk profile of the insured person, the Commissioner may determine  the  amount  of  qualifying  premiums,  that  is,  in  the  Commissioner's opinion, commensurate with the risk profile of the insured person; and the amount so  determined  is  taken  to  be  the  qualifying  premiums  paid.    This  is  an  antiavoidance provision aimed at guarding against any possible abuse of tax deduction by claiming unreasonably high premium for a VHIS policy.
28. If  a  taxpayer  disputes  an  assessment  for  the  amount  of  qualifying premiums as determined by the Commissioner, the taxpayer can give a notice of objection within one month after the date of the assessment.    The objection will be  processed  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  under  Part  11  of  the Ordinance.

## EXCESSIVE CLAIMS BY MARRIED COUPLES

### Deduction claims not considered

29. Section  26K(1)  allows  a  taxpayer  to  claim  deduction  for  qualifying premiums paid by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse (not being a spouse living apart).    Therefore,  for  married  couples  not  living  apart,  a  spouse  may  claim  a deduction for qualifying premiums paid by the other spouse as a policy holder. Section 26L(2), however, stipulates that the total deduction allowed to the married couple should not exceed the qualifying premiums paid by them.    According to section 26L(3), if the Commissioner has become aware of the existence of claims by a married couple that would, if allowed, result in a total deduction exceeding the qualifying premiums paid by them, the Commissioner must not consider any claim for the deduction until the married couple have reached an agreement that would result in a total deduction not exceeding the qualifying premiums paid.

**Example 13**

Mr. and Mrs. Q, husband and wife, purchased a VHIS policy for their daughter.    They paid qualifying premiums of $10,000 during the year of  assessment  2019/20.    Mr.  and  Mrs.  Q  claimed  deduction  for  the premiums paid of $8,000 each.

The claims of $16,000 (i.e. $8,000 + $8,000) in aggregate made by Mr. and Mrs. Q, if allowed, would exceed the premiums of $10,000 paid. Mr. Q and Mrs. Q would be invited to reach an agreement that would result  in  a  total  deduction  not  exceeding  the  premiums  paid.    In  the absence of an agreement, both claims made by Mr. Q and Mrs. Q would not be considered.

### Additional assessments

30. The provisions in section 26L(4) and (5) enable the Commissioner to resolve excessive claims made by married couples after deductions for qualifying premiums  have  been  allowed:  total  deduction  allowed  to  a  taxpayer  and  the taxpayer's spouse exceeded the qualifying premiums paid; or a deduction has been allowed  to  a  taxpayer  and,  within  6  months  after  allowing  the  deduction,  the taxpayer's  spouse  makes  a  claim  that  would,  if  allowed,  exceed  the  qualifying premiums paid.    In such circumstances, the married couple will be invited to reach an agreement that would result in a total deduction not exceeding the qualifying premiums  paid  and  additional  assessments  under  section  60  will  be  raised  in consequence of the agreement reached by them.    If the married couple are unable to reach an agreement within a reasonable time, additional assessment(s) will be made in respect of the deduction(s) already granted.

## REFUND OF PREMIUMS PAID

### Circumstances for refund of premiums

31. According to the VHIS Certified Plan Policy Template issued  by  the FHB,  refund  of  premiums  paid  would  generally  arise  under  the  following circumstances:

Cancellation within the cooling-off period

- (a) The policy holder may exercise the right of cancellation of the policy with full refund of paid premium during the cooling-off period of not less than 21 days, if no benefit payment has been made or is to be made.

Misstatement  of  personal  information/  misrepresentation  of  health related information

- (b) If  personal  (non-health  related)  information  or  health  related information  of  an  insured  person  that  may  impact  the  risk assessment of the insurer is misstated, the insurer shall have the right to declare the policy void as from the policy effective date. In such circumstances, the insurer shall have the right to demand refund of the benefits previously paid and the obligation to refund the premiums received.

#### Termination of policy

- (c) In case the policy is automatically terminated due to the death of the  insured  person  or  the  insurer  ceased  to  have  the  requisite authorization under the Insurance Ordinance to write the policy, the insurer shall refund the relevant premiums paid for the current policy year on a pro rata basis.

#### Compliance with law

- (d) If the policy is or becomes illegal under the law applicable to the policy holder or the insured person, the insurer shall  have  the right  to  terminate  the  policy  from  the  date  it  becomes  illegal. The insurer shall refund the relevant premiums paid for the policy year in which the policy is terminated on a pro rata basis.

### Statutory requirements

32. Pursuant to section 26M(1) and (2), if any of the qualifying premiums paid for an insured person is refunded, the qualifying premiums paid are taken to be reduced by the amount of the refund.    Therefore, in the case where the refund is made before a taxpayer claims the tax deduction, the taxpayer can only claim the reduced amount of the qualifying premiums paid.    According to section 26M(3)(a)

and (b), if the refund is made after a taxpayer has claimed the tax deduction, the taxpayer must notify the Commissioner in writing of the refund within 3 months after the date of refund.    Despite any time limit under section 60, the Assessor may, having regard to the reduction, make an additional assessment on the taxpayer under that section if the deduction has been allowed.

**Example 14**

Mr.  R  purchased  a  VHIS  policy  for  his  mother  and  paid  qualifying premiums  of  $8,000  on  20  March  2020.    He  exercised  his  right  to cancel the policy during the cooling-off period on 15 April 2020.    He was fully refunded of the premiums paid on 30 April 2020.    The 2019/20 tax return was issued to Mr. R for completion in May 2020.

Given the full refund of the premiums paid, the deductible amount would be reduced to nil.    Mr. R would not be entitled to claim deduction for any premiums paid in his 2019/20 tax return.

**Example 15**

Mr. S purchased a VHIS policy for his father.    On 1 April 2019, he paid a qualifying premium of $8,000 for the policy period from 1 April 2019 to  31  March  2020. Subsequently,  his  father  passed  away  on  31 December 2019 and the VHIS policy was automatically terminated on that date.    On 15 April 2020, part of the premium paid in the amount of $2,000 was refunded to Mr. S on a pro rata basis.    The 2019/20 tax return was issued to Mr. S for completion in May 2020.

Given the partial  refund  of  the  premium  paid,  the  deductible  amount should be reduced to $6,000 ($8,000 - $2,000).    Mr. S should claim deduction for the reduced amount in his 2019/20 tax return.

**Example 16**

Mr.  T  purchased  a  VHIS  policy  for  himself  and  paid  a  qualifying premium  of  $8,000  on  1  April  2019.    He  claimed  and  was  allowed deduction  of  the  premium  paid  for  the  year  of  assessment  2019/20. Owing  to  Mr.  T's  misstatement  of  certain  personal  information,  the insurance company subsequently declared the VHIS policy void and fully refunded the premium to Mr. T on 1 September 2020.

Since the refund was made after Mr. T had claimed the tax deduction, Mr. T should notify the Commissioner in writing of the refund within 3 months after the date of refund (i.e. on or before 1 December 2020).    An additional assessment for the year of assessment 2019/20 would be made on Mr. T to withdraw the deduction previously allowed.

## EXERCISE OF POWERS BY THE COMMISSIONER

33. For the purposes of the tax deduction, the Commissioner may exercise power to determine the amount of qualifying premiums that is commensurate with the  risk  profile  of  the  insured  person  under  section  26K(4);  refuse  to  consider claims made by a married couple or raise additional assessment in the absence of an agreement reached between them under section 26L(3) to (5).    Section 26K(5) empowers  the  Commissioner  to  exercise  such  powers  in  the  way  that  the Commissioner considers appropriate having regard only to the information in the Commissioner's possession when exercising the power.

## PENALTIES

### Prosecution

34. If a taxpayer, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with section 26M(3)(a)  by  not  notifying  the  Commissioner  in  writing  of  the  refund  of  the qualifying premiums paid within 3 months after the date of refund, the taxpayer commits  an  offence  under  section  80(2).    The  Commissioner  may  institute prosecution  against  the  taxpayer  for  the  offence  committed.    The  maximum penalty for each offence is a fine at level 3 and a further fine of treble the amount of  tax  undercharged.    As  an  alternative  to  proceeding  with  a  prosecution,  the Commissioner  may  compound  the  offence  (i.e.  accept  a  monetary  settlement instead of sanctioning the institution of a prosecution) under section 80(5).

### Additional tax

35. If  no  prosecution  under  section  80(2)  has  been  instituted  against  the taxpayer in respect of the taxpayer's failure to comply with section 26M(3)(a), the Commissioner  may  impose  additional  tax  under  section  82A.    The  maximum penalty is treble the amount of tax which has been undercharged in consequence of

the taxpayer's non-compliance, or which would have been undercharged if the noncompliance had not been detected.

36. Before making an assessment of additional tax, the Commissioner will arrange for a notice to be given to the taxpayer stating the offence in respect of which the Commissioner intends to assess additional tax.    The taxpayer is then allowed a specified period of at least 21 days to make written representations with regard  to  the  proposed  assessment  to  additional  tax.    The  Commissioner  will consider and take into account any representations received during the specified period when determining the amount of additional tax.    The taxpayer, if aggrieved by an assessment to additional tax, can appeal to the Board of Review against the assessment.

## ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION

### Holding over of payment of provisional salaries tax

37. Under section 63E(2)(be), a taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner to have the whole or part of the provisional salaries tax held over until the taxpayer is required  to  pay  salaries  tax  for  the  year  of  assessment  on  the  ground  that  the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse (not being a spouse living part from the taxpayer), or both of them, has or have paid, or is or are likely to pay, during the year of assessment,  qualifying  premiums  that  are  allowable  for  deduction  and  in  total, exceed or are likely to exceed the amount specified in Schedule 3E for the year preceding the year of assessment.
38. Schedule 46 to the Ordinance provides for a transitional arrangement under which a taxpayer may apply for the holding over of payment of provisional salaries  tax  in  respect  of  the  year  of  assessment  2019/20  on  the  ground  that  a deduction  for  qualifying  premiums  paid  is,  or  is  likely  to  be,  allowable  to  the taxpayer.
