## INTRODUCTION

Hong Kong is a major international financial centre (IFC) in the Asia Pacific region.    The financial services industry plays an important role in the Hong  Kong  economy  and  contributes  to  a  significant  percentage  of  Hong Kong's  GDP.    It  is  therefore  vital  to  maintain  and  strengthen  Hong  Kong's competitiveness as an IFC.    In Hong Kong, a substantial portion of the total assets  managed  by  the  fund  management  industry  is  sourced  from  overseas investors. Like other major IFCs (including New  York, London  and Singapore),  Hong  Kong  offers  tax  concession  to  offshore  funds.    Offshore funds,  for  the  purposes  of  this  Note,  refer  to  non-resident  entities,  whether individuals, corporations, partnerships or trustees of trust estates.    Anchoring offshore funds in the Hong Kong market has helped maintaining international expertise,  promoting  new  products  and  further  developing  the  local  fund management  business.    It  has  also  benefited  other  downstream  services sectors such as brokers, accountants, bankers and lawyers.

2. The Revenue (Profits Tax Exemption for Offshore Funds) Ordinance 2006 (the 2006 Ordinance) was enacted in March 2006.    The 2006 Ordinance added  below  sections  and  schedules  to  the  Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  (the Ordinance):
- (a) Section 20AB contains provisions for use in the interpretation of  sections  20AC  to  20AE  and  Schedule  15,  which  include provisions in determining the residency status of an individual, a corporation, a partnership and a trustee of a trust estate and the extent of a person's direct or indirect beneficial interest in another person.
- (b) Section 20AC stipulates that the exemption applies retrospectively from the year of assessment 1996/97 onwards and the circumstances in which the exemption can be allowed (the Exemption Provisions).
- (c) Section  20AD  provides  that  losses  arising  from  the  exempt transactions carried out by an offshore fund cannot be used to set off against its future assessable profits.
- (d) Section  20AE  stipulates  the  circumstances  in  which  the assessable  profits  of  a  tax-exempt  offshore  fund  are  to  be regarded  as  the  assessable  profits  of  a  resident  person  (the Deeming Provisions).
- (e) Section  70AB  contains  provisions  for  the  revision  of  an assessment necessitated by the retrospective application of the Exemption Provisions.
- (f) Schedule 15 contains the formula for ascertaining the amount to  be  regarded  as  the  assessable  profits  of  a  resident  person under the Deeming Provisions.
- (g) Schedule 16 lists the specified transactions that are covered by the exemption.
3. In  July  2015,  the  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2015 (the 2015 Ordinance) was enacted to extend the profits tax exemption for offshore  funds  to  offshore  private  equity  funds.    The  2015  Ordinance  also amended some of the provisions of the offshore fund regime.    Thus, there is a need  to  revise  this  Note  to  bring  it  up-to-date.    Regarding  the  interpretation and practices related to profits tax exemption for offshore private equity funds, reference should be made to Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 51 (Profits Tax Exemption for Offshore Private Equity Funds).

## BACKGROUND

### Before the 2006 Ordinance

4. Profits tax is imposed on every person carrying on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong in respect of his assessable profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong from such trade, profession or business, but excluding profits arising  from  the  sale  of  capital  assets.    Before  the  enactment  of  the  2006 Ordinance,  a  person,  resident  or  non-resident,  was  chargeable  to  profits  tax  in respect of his trading profits derived from securities transactions carried out in Hong  Kong  if  those  transactions  amounted  to  the  carrying  on  of  a  trade  or business.    However, profits tax was not and remains not chargeable in respect of offshore profits or capital gains, including those derived from securities transactions.

5. Certain specified investment funds are exempt from profits tax under section  26A(1A)  of  the  Ordinance.    These  include  mutual  funds,  unit  trusts and similar investment schemes which are authorized under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) (Cap. 571), and those investment schemes where the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) is satisfied that they are bona  fide  widely  held  and  comply  with  the  requirements  of  a  supervisory authority  within  an  acceptable  regime.    Mutual  funds,  unit  trusts  and  other similar  investment  schemes,  including  offshore  funds,  which  are  neither authorized nor 'bona fide widely held and supervised' do not qualify for the tax exemption under section 26A(1A).

### The 2006 Ordinance

6. Broadly  speaking,  two  sets  of  provisions  were  introduced  -  the Exemption Provisions and the Deeming Provisions. The Exemption Provisions  exempt  non-resident  persons  (including  individuals,  corporations, partnerships and trustees 1 of trust estates) from tax in respect of profits derived from certain specified transactions carried out through or arranged by specified persons.    To qualify for the exemption, a non-resident person must not carry on any other business in Hong Kong other than the specified transactions, or transactions  incidental  to  the  carrying  out  of  the  specified  transactions.    The exemption  did  not  however  cover  profits  derived  from  transactions  in  the shares,  debentures  or  the  related  rights,  options,  etc.  of  a  private  company. The  Exemption  Provisions  apply  with  retrospective  effect  from  the  year  of assessment 1996/97.    The exemption is intended for non-resident persons only. The Deeming Provisions are enacted  to  prevent  abuse,  or  round-tripping,  by resident  persons  disguised  as  non-resident  persons  to  take  advantage  of  the exemption.    In appropriate circumstances, a resident person will be deemed to have derived assessable  profits  in  respect  of  the  trading  profits  earned  by  an offshore  fund  from  the  specified  transactions  and  incidental  transactions  in Hong  Kong.  The  Deeming  Provisions  apply  from  the  year  of  assessment 2006/07.

1 Tax liability is imposed on the trustee of a trust estate as the chargeable person section 2 of the Ordinance includes 'trustee' as a person. Therefore, the Exemption Provisions seek to exempt the trustees of trust estates from tax where appropriate.

### The 2015 Ordinance

7. The  definition  of  'securities'  in  Part  2  of  Schedule  16  to  the Ordinance has been amended so that profits tax exemption will be extended to cover transactions in securities of an special purpose vehicle (SPV) or excepted private company.    Section 20AC has been amended to exempt a non-resident person that is  a  qualifying  fund  from  profits  tax  in  respect  of  profits  derived from  certain specified transactions without  engaging  a  specified  person. Section  20ACA  is  newly  added  to  exempt  an  SPV  from  payment  of  tax  in respect of profits derived from certain transactions concerning interposed SPVs or excepted private companies.    The 2015 Ordinance applies to transactions in securities  of  an  SPV  or  excepted  private  company  carried  out  from  1  April 2015 onwards.

## RESIDENT PERSON / NON-RESIDENT PERSON

8. Section  20AB  contains  the  definitions  of  'resident  person'  and 'non-resident person'.    Different legal tests are prescribed for individuals and non-individual  entities  (which  include  corporations,  partnerships  and  trustees of  trust  estates)  in  determining  whether  they  are  resident  persons.    By definition, a non-resident person is a person who is not a resident person.    The definitions of resident person and non-resident person apply equally to both the Exemption Provisions and the Deeming Provisions.

### Individuals

9. In  relation  to  a  year  of  assessment,  an  individual  is  regarded  as  a resident  person  if  he:  (a)  ordinarily  resides  in  Hong  Kong  in  that  year  of assessment;  or  (b)  stays  in  Hong  Kong  for  a  period  or  a  number  of  periods amounting to more than 180 days during that year of assessment or more than 300 days in two consecutive years of assessment one of which is that year of assessment.    These provisions are the same as those under section 41 of the Ordinance  on  the  meanings  of  a  'permanent  resident'  and  a  'temporary resident' who are eligible for election for Personal Assessment.
10. For  the  purposes  of  determining  an  individual's  residency,  it  is generally considered that an individual 'ordinarily resides' in Hong Kong if he

has a permanent home in Hong Kong where he or his family lives.    The mere fact that a person holds a Hong Kong identity card is inconclusive in showing that he ordinarily resides in Hong Kong.    In this respect, the Board of Review in its  decision D57/02, IRBRD vol 17, 829 applied the Court of Appeal case Director of Immigration v Ng Shun-loi in  deciding whether an individual was ordinarily resident in Hong Kong:

'The Hong Kong Court of Appeal has defined the term 'ordinarily resident' in Director of Immigration v Ng Shun-loi [1987] HKLR 798, per Hunter J:

- 'The words 'ordinarily resident' mean that the person must be habitually and normally resident here apart from temporary or occasional absences of long or short duration' (Levene v. IRC [1928] AC 217 applied) .
- 'A person is resident where he resides. … When is he ordinarily resident?    I think that is when he resides there in the ordinary way.    That must be the meaning of the adverb.    The expression is therefore contemplating residence for the purposes of everyday life.    It is residence in the place where a person lives and conducts his  daily  life  in  circumstances  which  lead  to  the conclusion that he is living there as an ordinary member of the community  would  live  for  all  the  purposes  of  his  daily  life' (R  v.  Barnet  London  Borough  Council,  ex  parte  Nilish  Shah [1982] 1 QB 688 applied). '
11. In ascertaining the number of days a person stays in Hong Kong, part of a day will be counted as one day.    This practice is consistently adopted in applying  the  60-day  rule  under  salaries  tax  in  section  8(1B),  in  deciding  the eligibility  for  election  for  Personal  Assessment  and  in  determining  residency for tax treaty purposes.

### Non-individual entities

12. Non-individual entities, which include corporations, partnerships and trustees  of  trust  estates,  are  subject  to  the  same  legal  test  in  determining whether  they  are  resident  persons.    In  relation  to  a  year  of  assessment,  a

corporation, a partnership or a trustee of a trust estate is regarded as a resident person if the central management and control of the corporation, partnership or trust estate is exercised in Hong Kong in that year of assessment.    In the case of  a  fund  structure  with  sub-funds  or  parallel  funds,  tax  exemption  may  be applicable  to  each  sub-fund  or  parallel  fund  if  each  individual  sub-fund  or parallel  fund  can  exist  as  a  separate  and  independent  legal  entity,  having  its own  distinctive  rights  and  obligations.    In  practice,  the  totality  of  facts (including the constitutive documents, investment mandates, rights and obligations  of  the  investment  manager)  have  to  be  examined  to  determine whether a sub-fund or parallel fund can be regarded as a non-resident for the purposes of section 20AC.

### Central management and control

13. The  'central  management  and  control'  test  is  a  well-established common law rule adopted in many jurisdictions, such as Singapore, the UK and Australia, in determining the residence of a company and other non-individual entities.    The common law rule was enunciated by Lord Loreburn in De Beers Consolidated Mines, Limited v Howe 5 TC 198 at page 213:
2. '… a company resides, for purposes of Income Tax, where its real business is carried on. … I regard that as the true rule; and the real business  is  carried  on  where  the  central  management  and  control actually abides.'
14. The  central  management  and  control  refers  to  the  highest  level  of control  of  the  business  of  a  company  or  an  entity.    The  exercise  of  central management and control does not necessarily require any active involvement. The  place  where  the  central  management  and  control  is  exercised  is  not necessarily the place where the main operations of the business are to be found, though the two places may often coincide.    Further, the place of incorporation of  a  company  or  the  place  of  establishment  of  an  entity  is  not  in  itself conclusive of the place where the central management and control is exercised, and  is  therefore  not  conclusive  of  the  place  where  the  company  or  entity  is resident per the judgment in Todd v Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Co. Ltd., 14 TC 119.

15. The location of central management and control is wholly a question of  fact.    Each  case  must  be  decided  on  its  own  facts.    Factors  that  are decisive  in  one  case  may  carry  little  weight  in  another.    In  general,  if  the central management and control of a company is exercised by the directors in board meetings or by the partners in partners meetings, the relevant locality is where those meetings are held.    In many cases, the directors or partners meets in the country where the business operations take place, and central management  and  control  is  clearly  located  in  that  country.    In  other  cases, central  management and control may be exercised by directors or partners in one jurisdiction though the actual business operations may take place elsewhere. It  should  be  noted  that  the  residence  of  individual  directors  or  partners  is generally  not  relevant  in  determining  the  locality  of  the  central  management and  control  of  a  company  or  partnership  (see,  however,  the  comments  in paragraph  16  below).    Therefore,  the  mere  fact  that  the  majority  of  the directors of a company or partners of a partnership are resident in Hong Kong does not of itself mean that the company or partnership is centrally managed and  controlled  in  Hong  Kong,  and  hence  would  not  adversely  affect  the application of the tax exemption.
16. The  place  of  board  meetings  or  partners  meetings  also  is  not necessarily  conclusive.    It  is  significant  only  in  so  far  as  those  meetings constitute  the  medium  through  which  central  management  and  control  is exercised.    In cases where central management and control of a company or a partnership  is  in  fact  exercised  by  an  individual  (for  example,  the  board chairman, the managing director or general partner), the relevant locality is the place  where  the  controlling  individual  exercises  his power.    As  central management  and  control  is  a  question  of  fact  and  reality,  when  reaching  a conclusion in accordance with the case law principles, only factors which exist for genuine commercial reasons will be accepted.
17. The asset portfolios of many overseas funds operating in Hong Kong are managed by fund managers in Hong Kong who are given full discretion to manage  the  asset portfolios. There may  be  concerns that the central management and control of those funds might in the circumstances be regarded as being exercised in Hong Kong, and they might be caught as resident persons and hence not qualify for the tax exemption.    The Department considers that the  residence  of  the  person  who  manages  the  asset  portfolios  on  behalf  of  a fund is not a conclusive factor in determining the residence of the fund.    If the

central management and control of a fund is not exercised in Hong Kong, the fund can qualify for the exemption notwithstanding that its asset portfolios are managed by a Hong Kong fund manager under his full discretion.

18. Appendix A sets out the Department's views on the residency status of  various  forms  of  investment  vehicles  commonly  adopted  in  holding  and managing investment portfolios.
19. It is reckoned that there is a practice of setting up an offshore fund by incorporating a company in an overseas jurisdiction, appointing two Hong Kong  fund  managers  as  the  company's  only  directors  and  granting  the managers full discretion to deal in Hong Kong securities.    The Department's view is that, under such a setup, the 'Hong Kong based fund' with its directors and principal officers exercising central management and control of the fund in Hong Kong is no different from a normal resident company.    Such a 'Hong Kong based fund' is not the intended beneficiary of, and hence is not entitled to claim for, the exemption.
20. The  Department  would  like  to  reiterate  that  adopting  the  'central management  and  control'  test  for  the  purposes  of  the  exemption  will  not impose  any  new  tax  liabilities  on  a  'Hong  Kong  based  fund'.    Before  the implementation of the exemption, a 'Hong Kong based fund' was chargeable to tax in respect of its trading profits derived from Hong Kong, but not offshore profits  or  capital  gains.    The  'central  management and control'  test will not alter this position.    Even if a 'Hong Kong-based fund' is determined to be a resident person by the 'central management and control' test, and hence does not qualify for the exemption, it will only continue to be chargeable to tax in respect  of  its  Hong  Kong  trading  profits,  and  not  offshore  profits  or  capital gains.    The  Exemption  Provisions  only  exempt  profits  which  are  otherwise chargeable to tax.    They are not a new charging section and do not affect the existing territorial source principle of taxation.

### Split year residence

21. Funds or other entities may change their residence during a year of assessment (i.e. from a non-resident person to a resident person or vice versa). Whilst cases of this type should be rare, the residence of the fund concerned will be determined on a year of assessment basis by reference to the respective

periods  during  which  the  fund  is  a  resident  or  non-resident  of  Hong  Kong. For a fund which is newly set up during a year of assessment, its residence will be determined by reference to the period from its set-up date to the end of the year of assessment.

## THE EXEMPTION PROVISIONS

### Exemption criteria

22. The Exemption Provisions are contained in section 20AC. Generally  speaking,  to  qualify  for  the  exemption,  a  person  has  to  satisfy  the following conditions:
- (a) the person is a non-resident person;
- (b) the specified transactions are carried out through or arranged by a specified person or the person is a qualifying fund; and
- (c)      the person does not carry on any trade, profession or business in Hong Kong involving transactions other than the specified transactions and transactions incidental to the carrying out of the  specified  transactions.    Specifically,  the  person  is  not permitted to engage in the following activities (which are not exhaustive) in Hong Kong:
    - (i) property development or property holding;
    - (ii) finance (banking, providing capital, leasing,  factoring or securitization);
    - (iii) insurance;
    - (iv) construction  or  acquisition  of  infrastructure  facilities; or
    - (v) making investments that derive rent, royalties or lease payments.

## Scope of Exemption

23. A  person  eligible  for  the  exemption  is  exempt  from  profits  tax  in respect of the profits derived from the specified transactions.    The exemption also  covers  profits  derived  from  the  incidental  transactions  provided  that  the trading receipts from the incidental transactions do not exceed 5% of the total trading receipts from  both the specified transactions and the incidental transactions.    If the 5% threshold is exceeded, the whole trading receipts from the incidental transactions will be chargeable to profits tax.    However, profits from the specified transactions will remain fully exempt.

### Specified Transactions

24. Specified transactions are broadly defined in the Ordinance to cover typical transactions carried out by offshore funds in Hong Kong.    Schedule 16 to  the  Ordinance  contains  the  list  of  specified  transactions  which  include  six categories of transactions:
- (a) a transaction in securities;
- (b) a transaction in futures contracts;
- (c) a transaction in foreign exchange contracts;
- (d) a transaction consisting in the making of a deposit other than by way of a money-lending business;
- (e) a transaction in foreign currencies; and
- (f) a transaction in exchange-traded commodities.

Appendix B sets out the Department's views on whether particular transactions are  covered  by  the  specified  transactions.    It  should  be  emphasised  that  the holding of debentures, loan stocks, bonds or notes to earn 'interest income' is not  a  transaction  in  securities  since  such  holding  does  not  involve  two transacting  parties  and  cannot  be  regarded  as  a  transaction.    The  interest derived therefrom could only considered as derived from incidental transactions and not specified transactions.

25. To cater for changes in the financial products traded in the market, the Commissioner is empowered under section 20AC(5) to amend Schedule 16 by notice published in the Gazette.

### Transaction in securities

26. Prior  to  the  enactment  of  the  2015  Ordinance,  'securities'  was defined to mean:
- (a) shares, stocks, debentures, loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes of, or issued by, a body, whether incorporated or unincorporated,  or  a  government  or  municipal  government authority;
- (b) rights,  options  or  interests  (whether  described  as  units  or otherwise) in, or in respect of, such shares, stocks, debentures, loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes;
- (c) certificates of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificates  for,  receipts  for,  or  warrants  to  subscribe  for  or purchase, such shares, stocks, debentures, loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes;
- (d) interests in any collective investment scheme; and
- (e) interests, rights or property,  whether  in  the  form  of  an instrument or otherwise, commonly known as securities,

but  does  not  include  shares  or  debentures  of,  or  rights,  options  or interests (whether described as units or otherwise) in, or in respect of, shares or debentures of, a company that is a private company within the meaning of section 11 of the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) 2 .

27. Schedule  16  also  contains  definitions  of  'collective  investment scheme', 'debenture' and 'share' in relation to the meaning of 'securities'.

2 Under section 11 of the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622), 'private company' means a company which by its articles - (a) restricts the right to transfer its shares; and (b) limits the number of its members to 50, not including persons who are in the employment of the company and persons who, having  been  formerly  in  the  employment  of  the  company,  were  while  in  that  employment,  and have continued after the determination of that employment to be, members of the company; and (c) prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for any shares or debentures of the company.

28. The  2015  Ordinance  has  modified  the  definition  of  'securities'  so that  profits  tax  exemption  can  be  extended  to  transactions  in  shares,  stocks, debentures, loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes of a private company which is an SPV  or  an  excepted  private  company  and  the  related  rights,  options,  or certificate  of  interest,  etc.    The  extended  profits  tax  exemption  applies  to specified transactions carried out from 1 April 2015 onwards.    In this context, 'private  company'  is  defined  to  mean  a  company  incorporated  in  or  outside Hong Kong that is not allowed to issue any invitation to the public to subscribe for any shares or debentures of the company.

### Transaction in futures contracts

29. 'Futures contract' is defined to mean:
- (a) a contract or an option on a contract that is listed or traded on the Hong Kong Futures Exchange Limited; or
- (b) any other contract for differences-
    - (i) that  is  listed  on  a  specified  stock  exchange,  or  traded on a specified futures exchange, within the meaning of section  1  of  Part  1  of  Schedule  1  to  the  SFO  (see Appendix C );
    - (ii) that an authorized institution within the meaning of the Banking  Ordinance  (BO)  (Cap.  155)  may  enter  into under that ordinance; or
    - (iii) the  transaction  in  respect  of  which  is  regulated  by  or under, or is carried out in compliance with, the SFO.
30. 'Contract  for  differences'  is  defined  to  mean  an  agreement  the purpose or effect of which is to obtain a profit or avoid a loss by reference to fluctuations in the value or price of property of any description or in an index or other factor designated for that purpose in the agreement.    In general terms, a  contract  for  differences  is  a  contract  which  rides  on  the  differences  in  the value of the underlying property or index, which is commonly used for hedging purposes  in  the  financial  market.    It  covers  a  wide  range  of  contracts,

including the common types of financial derivatives traded by offshore funds (e.g. cash-settled commodity  futures  contract, Hang  Seng  Index  futures contract, etc.).

31. The definition of 'futures contract' covers contracts for differences that  may  be  properly  carried  out  through  a  specified  stock  exchange  or  a specified  futures  exchange,  as  well  as  those  entered  into  by  an  authorized institution  under  the  BO  and  those  that  are  regulated  by  or  carried  out  in compliance with the SFO.

### Transaction in foreign exchange contracts

32. 'Foreign exchange contract' is defined to mean a contract other than a futures contract and an options contract, whereby the parties to the contract agree  to  exchange  different  currencies at  a  future  time .    It  covers  both leveraged and non-leveraged foreign exchange transactions.    The transactions may involve entirely foreign currencies, or foreign currencies and Hong Kong dollars.    Spot transactions in foreign currencies are discussed in paragraph 34 below.

### Transaction  consisting  in  the  making  of  a  deposit  other  than  by  way  of  a money-lending business

33. 'Deposit' is defined to mean a loan of money (a) at interest; or (b) repayable  at  a  premium  or  repayable  with  any  consideration  in  money  or money's  worth.    Offshore  funds  in  the  normal  course  of  business  may  hold money  deposits  in  their  asset  portfolios.    This  type  of  specified  transaction covers the holding of such money deposits, which may be in any currency, by offshore  funds.    As  clearly  provided,  this  type  of  specified  transaction  does not  cover  cases  where  a  person  makes  deposits  in  the  ordinary  course  of carrying on a money-lending business.    The term 'money-lending business' is not defined and would be accorded its ordinary meaning.    It is a question of fact  whether  a  money-lending  business  is  carried  on.    In  the  context  of  the Ordinance, it has been decided in tax cases that in determining if a money-lending  business  is  carried  on,  whether  there  is  a  money-lender's licence  granted  under  other  ordinances  is  not  conclusive.    See Shun  Lee Investment  Co.,  Ltd.  v  CIR, 1  HKTC  322  and  Board  of  Review  Decision D38/89, IRBRD vol 4, 433.

### Transaction in foreign currencies

34. 'Transaction in foreign currencies' covers spot transactions in foreign  currencies  (transactions  in  exchanging  currencies  at  a  future  time  are covered by 'transaction in foreign exchange contracts' - see paragraph 32) and transactions in exchanging foreign currencies from or to Hong Kong dollars.

### Transaction in exchange-traded commodities

35. 'Exchange-traded  commodity'  is  defined  to  mean  gold  or  silver traded  on  a  commodity  exchange  in  Hong  Kong  to  which  the  Commodity Exchanges (Prohibition) Ordinance (CEPO) (Cap. 82) does not apply by virtue of  section  3(d)  of  that  ordinance.    The  CEPO  in  general  prohibits  the operation of commodity exchanges in Hong Kong with the exception of those provided in section 3 thereof.    Section 3(d) refers to a commodity exchange which  was  in  operation  on  20  June  1973.    The  Chinese  Gold  &amp;  Silver Exchange Society is a commodity exchange in Hong Kong to which the CEPO does  not  apply  by  virtue  of  section  3(d).    This  type  of  specified  transaction therefore  covers  transactions  in  gold  or  silver  traded  on  the  Chinese  Gold  &amp; Silver Exchange Society.

### Incidental transactions

36. An offshore  fund  may  carry  out  transactions  in  Hong  Kong  which are not specified transactions but incidental to the carrying out of the specified transactions.    Under the Exemption Provisions, incidental transactions will not be regarded as 'any other business' carried on in Hong Kong.    An offshore fund still qualifies for the  exemption even if it carries out incidental transactions in the relevant year of assessment.    Subject to a 5% threshold, tax exemption is to be allowed in respect of the profits derived from the incidental transactions.    The  5%  threshold  refers  to  the  situation  where  the  trading receipts from the incidental transactions do not exceed 5% of the total trading receipts  from  the  specified  transactions  and  the  incidental  transactions  taken together.    If the 5% threshold is exceeded, the whole trading receipts from the incidental transactions (i.e. not just the amount in excess of the 5% threshold) will be chargeable to profits tax. Profits derived from the specified transactions, however, will remain fully exempt from tax.

37. The term 'incidental transaction' is not defined. The word 'incidental'  will  be  accorded  its  common  meaning 3 ,  which  should  cover  the various  modes  of  operation  of  different  offshore  funds.    Whether  particular transactions carried out by an offshore fund are 'incidental transactions' is a question of fact, which can only be determined by reference to the particular mode  of  operation  of the offshore  fund  concerned. Typical incidental transactions include custody of securities, and receipts of interest or dividend on securities acquired through the specified transactions.
38. 'Trading  receipts'  for  the  purposes  of  applying  the  5%  threshold mean  gross  receipts  that  should  have  been  chargeable  to  tax  but  for  the exemption.    Hence, receipts that all along are non-taxable without relying on the  Exemption  Provisions  (e.g.  tax-exempt  dividends  or  interest  income)  are excluded in applying the 5% threshold.

**Example 1**

A-Fund Limited was a non-resident company.    It had the following business receipts in the year of assessment 2014/15:

$

Dividends from Hong Kong listed companies 300,000

Receipts from other incidental transactions 260,000

Receipts from specified transactions

5,000,000

The  5%  threshold  was  applied  by  reference  to  the  'receipts  from other incidental transactions' and the 'receipts from  specified transactions'.    The  dividends,  all  along  tax-exempt,  were  not  be taken into account. As the 'receipts from other incidental transactions' only represent 4.94% of the total receipts (i.e. $260,000 ÷ ($5,000,000 + $260,000)), the 'receipts from other incidental  transactions'  together  with  the  'receipts  from  specified transactions' were exempt from profits tax under section 20AC.

3 According to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (sixth edition), 'incidental' means 'liable to happen to; naturally attaching to; occurring as something casual or of secondary importance; not directly relevant to; following (up)on as a subordinate circumstance'.

If  the  dividends  had  been  taken  into  account,  the  percentage  of 'receipts from incidental transactions' would have become 10.07% (i.e.  ($300,000  +  $260,000) ÷ (5,000,000  +  300,000  +  260,000)), which  exceeds  the  5%  threshold.    However,  such  computation would be wrong as explained in paragraph 38 above.

**Example 2**

Same facts as those in Example 1, but the amount of the 'receipts from other incidental transactions' was $270,000.

As the 5% threshold had been exceeded (i.e. $270,000 ÷ ($5,000,000 + $270,000) = 5.12%), the 'receipts from other incidental transactions' of $270,000 were chargeable to profits tax. The 'receipts from specified transactions', however, remained tax-exempt under section 20AC.

### Specified person

39. Tax  exemption  is  allowed  in  respect  of  profits  derived  by  the non-resident person from specified transactions if: (a) the specified transactions have been carried out through or arranged by a 'specified person'; or (b) the non-resident  person  is  a  qualifying  fund.    The  words  'arranged  by'  cover cases where a specified transaction is not carried out by a specified person but arranged  by  the  specified  person  to  be  carried  out  by  another  person.    For example, the fund manager of an offshore fund, who is a specified person, can arrange  to  buy/sell  stocks  traded  on  the  Tokyo  Stock  Exchange  through  an intermediary in Tokyo.    A specified person normally is a corporation licensed or an authorized financial institution registered under the SFO for carrying on a business  in  any  regulated  activity  as  defined  by  Part  1  of  Schedule  5  to  the SFO 4 .

4 Schedule 5 to the SFO stipulates the following regulated activities -

Type 1 : dealing in securities;

Type 2 : dealing in futures contracts;

Type 3 : leveraged foreign exchange trading;

Type 4 : advising on securities;

Type 5 : advising on futures contracts;

Type 6 : advising on corporate finance;

Type 7 : providing automated trading services;

Type 8 : securities margin financing;

Type 9 : asset management;

Type 10 : providing credit rating services.

40. The  SFO  came  into  operation  on  1  April  2003.    Before  the enactment of the SFO, a 'specified person' licensed to carry out the specified transactions  should  include  a  dealer,  an  investment  adviser,  a  commodity trading  adviser,  etc.  licensed  or  registered  under  certain  repealed  ordinances. To  apply  the  Exemption  Provisions  retrospectively  from  1  April  1996,  a specified person in relation to a specified transaction carried out before 1 April 2003 was defined to mean-
- (a) a bank as defined by section 2(1) of the BO;
- (b) a person registered as a dealer or commodity trading adviser under  Part  IV  of  the  Commodities  Trading  Ordinance  (Cap. 250) repealed under section 406 of the SFO;
- (c) a person registered as a dealer or an investment adviser under Part VI, or as a securities margin financier under Part XA, of the  Securities  Ordinance  (Cap.  333)  repealed  under  section 406 of the SFO; or
- (d) a  person  licensed  as  a  leveraged  foreign  exchange  trader under  Part  IV  of  the  Leveraged  Foreign  Exchange  Trading Ordinance (Cap. 451) repealed under section 406 of the SFO.

### Loss from exempt transactions

41. Profits  from  the  specified  transactions  are  exempt  from  tax.    As  a matter of symmetry, losses sustained by a tax-exempt offshore fund from the specified  transactions  in  a  year  of  assessment  are  not  available  for  set  off against  any  of  its  assessable  profits  for  any  subsequent  years  of  assessment. In  fact,  this  treatment  is  similar  to  that  for  offshore  profits  and  capital  gains. Since  Hong  Kong  does  not  tax  offshore  profits  or  capital  gains,  offshore  or capital losses are not allowed to set off against a person's assessable profits.

### Effective date

42. The Exemption Provisions applied with retrospective effect from the year  of  assessment  commencing  on  1  April  1996.    The  2015  Ordinance extended the profits tax exemption to cover transactions in securities of an SPV or excepted private company, carried out from 1 April 2015 onwards.

## THE DEEMING PROVISIONS

### General

43. The  exemption  is  intended  for  non-resident  persons  only.    The Deeming  Provisions  are  enacted  to  prevent  abuse,  or  round-tripping,  by resident  persons  disguised  as  non-resident  persons  to  take  advantage  of  the exemption.    A resident person who, alone or jointly with his associates, holds direct  and/or  indirect  beneficial  interest  of  30%  or  more  in  a  tax-exempt offshore fund, or any  percentage if the offshore fund is  the resident person's associate, will be deemed to have derived assessable profits in respect of:
- (a) the trading profits earned by the offshore fund from specified transactions  and  incidental  transactions  carried  out  in  Hong Kong under section 20AE; and
- (b) the  trading  profits  earned  by  the  SPV  from  transactions  in securities  of  an  interposed  SPV  or  of  an  excepted  private company under section 20AF.

The application of the Deeming Provisions would not by itself alone render the resident  person  to  be  deemed  to  be  carrying  on  a  business  in  respect  of  his other activities.    The  amount of deemed profits is ascertained by taking into account  the  percentage  of  the  resident  person's  beneficial  interest  in  the offshore  fund  and  the  length  of  ownership  within  the  relevant year of assessment.

44. Section 20AB sets out the definitions of 'direct beneficial interest' and 'indirect beneficial interest'.

### Direct beneficial interest

45. Section 20AB(4) provides that a person is to be regarded as having a direct  beneficial  interest  in  a  corporation,  a  partnership,  a  trustee  of  a  trust estate or any other entity if:
- (a) he holds any of the issued share capital (however described) of the corporation (where the corporation is not a trustee of a trust estate);
- (b) he,  as  a  partner  in  the  partnership,  is  entitled  to  any  of  the profits  of  the  partnership  (where  the  partnership  is  not  a trustee of a trust estate); or
- (c) he, otherwise than through another person    -
    - (i) benefits under the trust estate; or
    - (ii) not being a trustee of the trust estate (or a director of the trustee where the trustee is a corporation), is able or might reasonably be expected to be able to control the activities  of  the  trust  estate  or  the  application  of  its corpus or income;
- (d) he has any of the ownership interests in  the  entity which is not a corporation, a partnership and a trustee of a trust estate.
46. In  Schedule  15  to  the  Ordinance,  the  extent  of  a  person's  direct beneficial interest in a corporation, a partnership or a trustee of a trust estate is defined to mean:
- (a) the percentage of the issued share capital (however described) of the corporation held by the person;
- (b) the  percentage  of  the  profits  of  the  partnership  to  which  the person is entitled; or
- (c) the percentage in value of the trust estate in which the person is interested.
47. The following specific provisions apply in ascertaining the extent of a person's direct beneficial interest in a corporation or a partnership.
- (a) A  fund  manager  of  a  fund  corporation  may  hold  non-profit participating shares for the sole purpose of managing the fund corporation.    To  apply  the  Deeming  Provisions  fairly  to  a fund manager  or other persons holding such non-profit participating shares, the shares comprised in the issued share

capital  of  a  corporation  that  do  not  entitle  their  holders  to receive dividends, whether in cash or in kind, and a distribution  of  the  corporation's  assets  upon  its  dissolution (other  than  a  return  of  capital)  are  excluded  according  to section  20AB(9)  in  computing  the  percentage  of  the  issued share capital of the corporation held by a person.

**Example 3**

B-Fund Limited had 10,000 issued shares, out of which 500 shares were 'management shares' which entitled their holders  to  special  management  rights  but  not  dividends  or distributions of assets upon dissolution. L Limited, a resident fund management company, was appointed as B-Fund  Limited's  fund  manager  and  the  500  'management shares' were allotted to it.    L Limited also acquired further 1,500 issued shares of B-Fund Limited.

The extent of L Limited's direct beneficial interest in B-Fund Limited was computed as 1,500 ÷ (10,000 - 500) = 15.79%. The 500 'management shares' were excluded in ascertaining its beneficial interest in the fund.

- (b) In computing the percentage of the profits of a partnership to which a person is entitled, if the person is not entitled to the partnership's profits but entitled to a distribution of the partnership's  assets  upon  its  dissolution,  a  reference  to  the entitlement  to  the  partnership's  profits  is  to  be  construed according to section 20AB(8) as a reference to the entitlement to a distribution of the partnership's assets upon its dissolution.

### Indirect beneficial interest

48. Section 20AB(5) provides that a person is to be regarded as having an indirect beneficial interest in a corporation, a partnership, a trustee of a trust estate or any other entity if, through an interposed person or a series of two or more interposed persons:

- (a) he  is  interested  in  any  of  the  issued  share  capital  (however described) of the corporation (where the corporation is not a trustee of a trust estate);
- (b) he is  entitled  to  any  of  the  profits  of  the  partnership  (where the partnership is not a trustee of a trust estate); or
- (c) he -
    - (i) benefits under the trust estate; or
    - (ii) not being a trustee of the trust estate (or a director of the trustee where the trustee is a corporation), is able or might reasonably be expected to be able to control the activities  of  the  trust  estate  or  the  application  of  its corpus or income;
- (d) he has any of the ownership interests in  the  entity which is not a corporation, a partnership and a trustee of a trust estate.
49. A  person  has  an  indirect  beneficial  interest  in  a  corporation,  a partnership,  a  trustee  of  a  trust  estate  or  any  other  entity,  if  he  has  a  direct beneficial interest in the first interposed person and the first interposed person has a direct beneficial interest in the next interposed person and so on, and the last  interposed  person  has  a  direct  beneficial  interest  in  the  corporation,  the partnership or the trustee of the trust estate.
50. The extent of a person's indirect beneficial interest in a corporation, a  partnership,  a  trustee  of  a  trust  estate  or  any  other  entity  is  arrived  at  by multiplying  the  percentage  of  the  person's  beneficial  interest  in  the  first interposed person by the percentage of the first interposed person's beneficial interest  in  the  next  interposed  person  and  so  on,  and  finally  by  the  last interposed person's beneficial interest in the corporation, the partnership,    the trustee of the trust estate or any other entity.

### Control of a trust estate

51. A person who has the control of the activities of a trust estate can distribute the trust estate's income or asset  according  to his discretion and to whomever  he  chooses  including  himself.    To  counteract  opportunities  for tax-avoidance,  a  person  who  has  a  direct  or  indirect  beneficial  interest  in  a trustee of a trust estate by reason of the fact that he is able or might reasonably be  expected  to  be  able  to  control  the  activities  of  the  trust  estate  or  the application  of  its  corpus  (i.e.  capital)  or  income,  is  to  be  regarded  as  being interested  in  100%  in  value  of  the  trust  estate  per  sections  20AE(5)  and 20AF(4).

### Associate

52. In administering the Deeming Provisions, provisions on 'associate' are  required  to  prevent  resident  persons  from  circumventing  the  Deeming Provisions by holding beneficial interests in offshore funds through associates. Under  section  20AE(2),  beneficial  interests  in  an  offshore  fund  held  by  a resident person's associates, resident or non-resident, will be taken into account in determining whether the '30% or more' threshold is exceeded.    Besides, in the  case  where  a  resident  person  holds  a  beneficial  interest  in  a  tax-exempt offshore  fund  which  is  his  associate,  the  Deeming  Provisions  will  apply,  per sections  20AE(3)  and  20AF(2),  in  respect  of any percentage  of  the  resident person's  beneficial  interest  in  the  offshore  fund.    The  adopted  definition  of 'associate'  and  the  related  definitions  of  'associated  corporation',  'control', 'principal  officer'  and  'relative'  in  section  20AE(10)  have  been  repealed  by the 2015 Ordinance and placed in section 20AC(6) such that the definitions are applicable to the Exemption Provisions and Deeming Provisions.
53. Specific provisions on 'associate' apply where the resident person is a natural person, a corporation or a partnership.    Broadly speaking, in respect of a resident person who is a natural person, 'associate' generally includes his 'relative' and a corporation controlled by him.    In respect of a resident person which is a corporation, 'associate' generally includes its 'associated corporation', which is defined to mean a corporation over which the resident corporation  has  control,  a  corporation  which  has  control  over  the  resident corporation, or a corporation which is under the control of the same person as the resident corporation.    In respect of a resident person which is a partnership,

'associate' generally includes a partner of and a corporation controlled by the resident partnership.    The 2015 Ordinance has also modified the definition of 'associate' to cover the following persons-

- (a) if it is a corporation, a partnership in which the corporation is a partner; and
- (b) if  it  is  a  partnership,  an  'associated  partnership'  of  the partnership.

The term 'associated partnership' is defined to mean a partnership over which the resident partnership has control, a partnership which has control over the resident  partnership,  or  a  partnership  which  is  under  the  control  of  the  same person as the resident partnership.

54. For  the  purposes  of  sections  20AC,  20AE  and  20AF,  where  a resident person holds beneficial interest in a tax-exempt offshore fund which is a  partnership,  the  Department  adopts  the  position  that  the  mere  fact  that  the resident person is a partner in the offshore fund and the other partners in the offshore fund are fellow partners of the resident person would not render the offshore  fund  or  the  other  partners  in  the  offshore  fund  'associates'  of  the resident person.

### Examples  on  applying  the  Deeming  Provisions  by  reference  to  beneficial interests

55. The following examples illustrate when the Deeming Provisions will apply  by  reference  to  a  resident  person's  beneficial  interest  in  a  tax-exempt offshore fund.

#### (a) Both direct and indirect beneficial interests are taken into account

**Example 4**

M  Limited,  a  resident  company,  directly  held  20%  and, through  other  companies,  indirectly  held  15%  of  the  issued shares of C-Fund Limited, a tax-exempt offshore fund.

The Deeming Provisions applied to M Limited.    M Limited's direct and indirect beneficial interests in C-Fund Limited (i.e. 20% + 15% = 35%) exceeded the '30% or more' threshold. 35%  of  the  exempt  profits  of  C-Fund  Limited  would  be deemed to be the assessable profits of M Limited.

#### (b) Beneficial interests held by  associates are taken  into account

**Example 5**

N  Limited  and  O  Limited  were  resident  companies.    They were  fellow  subsidiaries  of  the  same  holding  company.    N Limited and O Limited respectively held 20% and 25% of the issued shares of D-Fund Limited, a tax-exempt offshore fund.

N Limited and O Limited were associates as they were under the control of the same  company.    As  their beneficial interests  in  D-Fund  Limited  in  total  exceeded  the  '30%  or more'  threshold  (i.e.  20%  +  25%  =  45%),  the  Deeming Provisions were applicable to both of them.    Deemed assessable profits were ascertained by reference to the respective percentages of their beneficial interests in D-Fund Limited.    Hence,  20%  and  25%  of  the  exempt  profits  of D-Fund Limited were deemed to be the assessable profits of N Limited and O Limited respectively.

**Example 6**

Same  facts  as  those  in  Example  5,  but  O  Limited  was  a non-resident company.

The  Deeming  Provisions  were  not  applicable  to  O  Limited, which was a non-resident company. The Deeming Provisions  continued  to  be  applicable  to  N  Limited  as  its beneficial interest together with that of O Limited (though it is a  non-resident  company)  in  D-Fund  Limited  exceeded  the

'30%  or  more'  threshold.    20%  of  the  exempt  profits  of D-Fund Limited would be deemed to be the assessable profits of N Limited.    O Limited did not have any tax liability since the Deeming Provisions were not to be applied to a non-resident.

- (c) The  Deeming  Provisions  will  apply  in  respect  of  any percentage of beneficial interests held in an offshore fund which is an associate of a resident person

**Example 7**

P Limited, a resident company, held 20% of the issued shares of E-Fund  Limited, a tax-exempt offshore fund and an associate of P Limited.

Although  the  beneficial  interest  held  by  P  Limited  was  less than  30%,  the  Deeming  Provisions  would  continue  to  apply since it held some beneficial interest in E-Fund Limited which was its associate.

### Ascertainment of deemed profits

56. The  amount  of  deemed  assessable  profits  imposed  on  a  resident person for a year of assessment is ascertained in accordance with Schedule 15 to the Ordinance.    The amount of deemed assessable profits will be the total sum by adding up the amount ascertained by the formula in paragraph 57 for each  day  in  the  period  during  which  the  resident  person  has  the  following percentage  of  direct  and/or  indirect  beneficial  interest  in  the  tax-exempt offshore fund:

- (a) alone or jointly with his associates, 30% or more; or
- (b) any  percentage  if  the  offshore  fund  is  the  resident  person's associate.
57. Part 1 of Schedule 15 sets out the following formula in ascertaining the amount of exempt profits of an offshore fund (which is the amount of the

deemed assessable profits of the resident person) for a particular day in a year of assessment:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where :  A means  the  exempt  profits  of  the  offshore  fund  for  a particular day in a year of assessment

- B means  the  extent  of  the  resident  person's  beneficial interest in the offshore fund on that particular day
- C means the exempt profits of the offshore fund for the accounting period in which the particular day falls
- D means  the  total  number  of  days  in  the  accounting period of the offshore fund in which the particular day falls

Appendix D contains  an  example  on  how  the  deemed  assessable  profits  are ascertained for a resident person who holds an indirect beneficial interest in a tax-exempt offshore fund through a number of interposed persons.

58. The following examples elaborate some salient points in ascertaining the deemed assessable profits.
(a) Only days to which the Deeming Provisions apply need be included in computing the deemed assessable profits for a year of assessment

**Example 8**

On 1 October 2014, Q Limited, a resident company, purchased  20%  of  the  issued  shares  of  F-Fund  Limited,  a tax-exempt offshore fund. F-Fund  Limited was not  Q Limited's  associate.    Q  Limited  and  its  associates  had  no other  beneficial  interest  in  F-Fund  Limited.    On  1  January 2015, Q Limited purchased further 30% of the issued shares of  F-Fund  Limited.    F-Fund  Limited  closed  its  accounts  on

31 March each year.    During the year ended 31 March 2015, F-Fund  Limited  derived  assessable  profits  of  $8m  from  the specified transactions.

The deemed assessable  profits  of  Q  Limited  for  the  year  of assessment  2014/15  was  computed  as:  $8m × 50% × (90 days ÷ 365 days) = $0.99m.    '90 days' should refer to the period from 1 January 2015 to 31 March 2015 and '365 days' to  the  year  ended  31  March  2015.    The  period  from  1 October to 31 December 2014 during which Q Limited only held  a  beneficial  interest  of  20%  (i.e.  less  than  30%)  in F-Fund Limited were not to be taken into account.

(b) The tax-exempt offshore fund adopts an accounting date other than 31 March

**Example 9**

G-Fund  Limited,  a  tax-exempt  offshore  fund,  adopted  31 December  as  its  accounting  date.    It  derived  assessable profits  of  $10m  and  $12m  from  the  specified  transactions respectively for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2015. R Limited, a resident company, held 50% of the issued shares of  G-Fund  Limited  during  the  period  from  1  October  2014 and 30 September 2015.

Ascertainment  of  deemed  assessable  profits  was  made  by reference to the year of assessment from 1 April to 31 March irrespective of the accounting date of the tax-exempt offshore fund.    The  deemed  assessable  profits  for  R  Limited  were computed as follows:

Year  of  assessment  2014/15:  $10m × 50% × (92  days ÷ 365  days)  +  $12m × 50% × (90  days ÷ 365  days)  = $1.26m + $1.48m = $2.74m. ('92 days' referred to the period from  1  October  to  31  December  2014  and  '90  days'  to  1 January to 31 March 2015.)

Year  of  assessment  2015/16:  $12m × 50% × (183  days ÷ 365 days) = $3.01m. ('183 days' referred to the period from 1 April to 30 September 2015.)

(c) The resident person adopts an accounting date other than 31 March

**Example 10**

Same  facts  as  those  in  Example  9.    R  Limited  adopted  30 June as its accounting date.

The deemed assessable profits for R Limited for the years of assessment 2014/15 and 2015/16 would be ascertained on the same basis as that in Example 9 irrespective of the accounting date adopted by R Limited.    See paragraph 66 below on how R Limited should report the deemed assessable profits in its profits tax returns.

(d) Non-taxable items not to be taken into account in ascertaining deemed assessable profits

**Example 11**

H-Fund Limited, a tax-exempt offshore fund, derived assessable profits of $20m from the specified transactions for its accounting year ended 31 March 2015.    During the same year,  it  also  received  dividends  of  $1m  from  a  Hong  Kong listed  company  and  interests  of  $2m  on  a  long  term  debt instrument (within the meaning of section 26A of the Ordinance).    S Limited, a resident company, held 50% of the issued  shares  of  H-Fund  Limited  during  the  year  ended  31 March 2015.

The deemed assessable profits for S Limited for the  year of assessment 2014/15 was $20m × 50% = $10m. The non-taxable items (i.e. dividends of $1m and interests of $2m) should not be included in computing the deemed assessable profits.

(e) Expenses  incurred  by  the  resident  in  generating  deemed assessable profits are not deductible

**Example 12**

Same  facts  as  those  in  Example  11.    S  Limited  incurred general  administration  expenses  of  $1m  during  the  year ended  31  March  2015  and  sought  to  deduct  such  expenses against the deemed assessable profits.

Deduction in respect of the administration expenses could not be  allowed.    Any  expenses  incurred  by  H-Fund  Limited  in earning the profits from the specified transactions would have been  deducted  in  ascertaining  H-Fund's  assessable  profits, which were deemed to be the assessable profits of S Limited.

### No deemed loss for resident persons

59. The policy objective of the exemption is to attract foreign capital to invest in the local market.    The Deeming Provisions are intended disincentives to  resident  persons  for  taking  advantage  of  the  exemption  by  carrying  out round-tripping.    In this regard, the Deeming Provisions only impose deemed profits but not losses on a resident person.    A resident person, therefore, will not be entitled to claim any proportionate amount of the losses sustained by a tax-exempt offshore fund in which he holds a beneficial interest.
60. A resident person may sustain losses in other businesses carried on in Hong Kong for the relevant year of assessment.    Section 20AE provides that the  deemed  assessable  profits  'are  to  be  regarded  as  the  assessable  profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong of the resident person for that year of assessment  from  a  trade,  profession  or  business  carried  on  by  the  resident person  in  Hong  Kong.'    Whether  a  resident  person  can  set  off  the  deemed assessable  profits,  like  those  derived  from  a  normal  trade,  profession  or business, by losses sustained in its/his other businesses in accordance with the provisions of section 19C depends on its/his status.    In the case of a resident corporation,  the  set-off  is  allowable.    In  the  case  of  a  resident  individual  or resident  partnership,  the  set-off  is  not  allowable,  unless  the  holding  of  the beneficial  interest  in  the  offshore  fund  is  part  and  parcel  of  his/its  other

business.    The individual or partners of the partnership can, however, obtain the set-off under personal assessment, if applicable.

### Deeming Provisions not to apply in certain circumstances

61. It will be unlikely for a resident person to carry out round-tripping by holding a beneficial interest in an offshore fund that is bona fide widely held by investors.    On  this  consideration,  the  Deeming  Provisions  do  not  apply  to  a resident  person  if  the  Commissioner  is  satisfied  under  section  20AE(8)  that beneficial interests in the offshore fund concerned are bona fide widely held.
62. The  term  'bona  fide  widely  held',  which  also  appears  in  section 26A(1A), is not defined in the Ordinance.    In the context of section 26A(1A), the Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 20 (Revised) ('Mutual Funds, Unit Trusts,  and  Similar  Investment  Schemes')  (DIPN  20)  states  that the  'bona  fide  widely  held'  requirement  is  satisfied  if,  during  the  year  of assessment in question, at no time did fewer than 50 persons hold (or have the right to become the holders of) all of the units or shares in the scheme and at no time  during  the  year  did  fewer  than  21  persons  hold  (or  have  the  right  to become  the  holders  of)  units  or  shares  that  entitled  the  holders,  directly  or indirectly, to 75%, or more, of the income or property of the scheme.
63. Where  the  above  benchmark  figures  are  not  met,  it  will  still  be accepted in practice that the requirement has been satisfied if it is clear from the constitutive documents of the scheme and other relevant material that it was established with a view to wide public participation and that genuine efforts are being  taken  with  the  aim  of  achieving  that  objective  (i.e.  there  is  nothing  to suggest that the scheme is intended to be a  closely held  investment vehicle). This situation could arise, for example, where a scheme has only recently been established or where, despite the wishes of the parties concerned, it has proved to  be  unpopular  with  investors.    The  Department  considers  that,  for  the purposes of section 20AE(8), 'bona fide widely held' should adopt the same practice as stated in DIPN 20.
64. A resident person may hold indirect beneficial interest in an offshore fund through interposed persons who are also resident persons.    In the absence of any specific provisions, the Deeming Provisions will separately apply to the resident  person  and  the  interposed  resident  persons.    Double  taxation  of

deemed assessable profits by reference to the profits of the same offshore fund would  thus  arise.    To  avoid  this  anomaly,  section  20AE(9)  specifically provides  that  a  resident  person  is  not  liable  to  tax  in  respect  of  the  deemed assessable profits  if  any  of  the  interposed  resident  persons  through  whom  he holds an indirect beneficial interest in an offshore fund is liable to tax under the Deeming Provisions in respect of the assessable profits  of  the  same  offshore fund.

**Example 13**

T Limited held 90% of the issued shares of U Limited which in turn held 70% of the issued shares of V Limited.    V Limited held 50% of the issued shares of I-Fund Limited, a tax-exempt offshore fund. T Limited, U Limited and V Limited were all resident companies.

Under the Deeming Provisions, deemed assessable profits representing 50% of the exempt profits of I-Fund Limited would be attributed to V Limited.

Under  section  20AE(9),  no  deemed  assessable  profits  would  be attributed to T Limited and U Limited notwithstanding that they both hold indirect beneficial interests of more than 30% (T Limited: 90% × 70% × 50% = 31.5%; U Limited: 70% × 50% = 35%) in I-Fund Limited.    Deemed assessable profits in respect of the same exempt profits of I-Fund Limited had already been imposed on V Limited.

### Reporting requirements

65. Section 20AE imposes tax liabilities on a resident person in respect of the deemed assessable profits.    As with other persons chargeable to tax, the resident person bears the legal obligation of complying with other provisions of the  Ordinance  on  reporting  chargeability,  lodgment  of  returns,  providing information,  payment  of  tax,  etc.    Penalties  under  Part  14  of  the  Ordinance may be imposed for failures to comply with the relevant statutory provisions.
66. Examples  9  and  10  above  set  out  that  the  amount  of  deemed assessable profits is to be computed on a year of assessment basis irrespective of the accounting date adopted by the tax-exempt offshore fund or the resident

person.    As illustrated in the examples, a resident person may be required to report the deemed assessable profits for a year of assessment by reference to more than one set of annual accounts of the offshore fund.    It is envisaged that the annual accounts of the offshore fund covering the later part of the year of assessment may not have been finalized when the resident person is required to file  his  tax  return.    In  such  a  case,  the  Department  accepts  the  arrangement that  the  resident  person  may report in his tax return for a  year of assessment (which  is  to  be  filed  within  the  normal  time  limit)  only  the  amount  of  the deemed assessable  profits  attributable  to  the  annual  accounts  of  the  offshore fund that are already closed within that year of assessment.    In respect of the remaining  amount  of  the  deemed  assessable  profits  attributable  to  the  next annual accounts of the offshore fund, the resident person is required to report it within four months after the annual accounts closing date by way of a letter to be sent to the Department.    The letter is to be treated as additional information to the resident person's tax return.    Additional assessment for the relevant year of  assessment  will  be  raised  on  the  remaining  amount  of  deemed  assessable profits as appropriate.

**Example 14**

Same facts as  those  in  Example  9.    Within  the  year  of  assessment 2014/15, G-Fund Limited only closed its accounts for the year ended 31  December  2014.    In  its  profits  tax  return  for  the  year  of assessment  2014/15  (which  should  be  filed  within  the  normal  time limit),  R  Limited  should  report  the  deemed  assessable  profits  of $1.26m for the period from 1 October to 31 December 2014.

Not later than 30 April 2016, R Limited should send a letter to the Department to report the deemed assessable profits of $1.48m for the period from 1 January to 31 March 2015.    An additional assessment for the year of assessment 2014/15 with additional assessable profits of $1.48m would be raised on R Limited.

In  its  profits  tax  return  for  the  year  of  assessment  2015/16  (which was  to  be  filed  within  the  normal  time  limit),  R  Limited  should report the deemed assessable profits of $3.01m for the period from 1 April to 30 September 2016.

67. There may be cases where a resident person relies on the information provided by an offshore fund in determining whether any deemed profits arose or  in  reporting  an  incorrect  amount  of  deemed  profits  to  the  Department. Under the Ordinance, a taxpayer will only be imposed a penalty if he fails to perform the legal obligations 'without reasonable excuse'.    The Department, before imposing a penalty, would consider the whole facts and circumstances in deciding whether a resident person's reliance on incorrect information provided by  an  offshore  fund  constitutes  a  reasonable  excuse.    Further,  a  resident person has the right to appeal against the penalty imposed by the Department if he does not agree with it.

### Effective date

68. The Deeming Provisions under section 20AE apply from the year of assessment  commencing  on  1  April  2006.    A  resident  person  is  required  to report  his  deemed  assessable  profits  for  the  year  ended  31  March  2007  and subsequent years in his tax returns.    Alternatively, if he has not already been required to furnish a return for any year of assessment in which he has deemed assessable  profits,  he  should  inform  the  Commissioner  in  writing  of  his chargeability within 4 months after the end of the basis period of the year of assessment concerned.    The deemed assessable profits should be ascertained and reported by reference to the year ended 31 March of each year irrespective of the accounting date adopted by the tax-exempt offshore fund or the resident person.

## TAX AVOIDANCE

### General anti-avoidance provisions

69. The Department will  generally  act  in  accordance  with  this  Note  in providing profits tax exemption to offshore funds and administering the related issues.    However,  in  cases  where  tax  avoidance  is  involved,  the  Department will consider invoking the general anti-avoidance provisions under sections 61 or 61A of the Ordinance as appropriate to counteract the avoidance.

1 In  case  of  a  company,  the  relevant  board  of  directors  can  remove  the  fund  manager,  monitors  and evaluates the fund manager's performance, and may direct the funds to be invested in other countries. In  the  case  of  a  trust,  the  relevant  trustee  is  legally  in  charge  of  the  trust  estate  and  ultimately responsible to the beneficiaries (i.e. unit holders).    He supervises the operation of the trust to ensure compliance with the trust's constitutive documents, ensures that the fund manager complies with the investment strategy, reviews the fund manager's performance and has the power to remove the fund manager  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  in  the  trust  deed.    The  mere  fact  that  the majority of the directors of the management board of a company (if that is the highest level of control of the business of the fund) are resident in Hong Kong would not adversely affect the residence status of the company (see paragraph 15).    Neither will the mere outsourcing of back office administrative work to a service provider in Hong Kong affect the taxable entity's residence.

2 The  residence  of  an  individual  is  based  on  the  'ordinary  or  temporary  residence'  test  and  not  the 'central management and control' test.    This example is added for the sake of completeness.
