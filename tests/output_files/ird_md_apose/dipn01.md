**PART A: COMPUTING ASSESSABLE PROFITS** 

**BASIS FOR COMPUTING ASSESSABLE PROFITS *Profits arisen or derived*** 

Profits  tax  is  charged  under  section  14  of  the  Inland  Revenue Ordinance  (the  Ordinance)  on  a  person  carrying  on  a  trade,  profession  or business in Hong Kong in respect of the person’s assessable profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong from such trade, profession or business.   Section 2 defines “assessable profits” to mean the profits in respect of which a person is chargeable to tax for the basis period for any year of assessment.   

***Full amount of profits*** 

2. Section 18B(1) provides that the assessable profits for any year of assessment from any trade, profession or business carried on in Hong Kong shall be computed on the full amount of the profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong during the year of assessment.   The full amount of the profits arisen or derived during the year of assessment is determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles subject to the requirement of conformity with the tax laws (i.e. the Ordinance and the relevant judicial interpretations).   In *CIR v Secan Ltd & Another* (2000) 3 HKCFAR 411, Lord Millett NPJ said at page 419 that losses, of course, are merely the  mirror image of profits, and must be ascertained for tax purposes in the like manner.   Further, section 19D provides that the amount of loss incurred by a person shall be computed in like manner and for such basis period as assessable profits would have been computed. 

   ***Accounting period as basis period*** 

3. [Section 18B(2) ](https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1518314&crid=74c2b2de-1a3a-4e71-8036-236c9333d261&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fanalytical-materials-hk%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5V91-4DN1-FGJR-2403-00000-00&pdscrollreferenceid=HKEFP.V26.TR.19&pdtocnodeidentifier=AAVAABAACAAEAADAAB&ecomp=ydghk&prid=baa92f38-184e-4420-9d2a-59ed6438eb85)allows a person to choose an accounting period that ends on a day within a year of assessment as the basis period for that year.   If the financial statements are drawn up to 31 March annually, the basis period for the year of assessment 2019/20 will be the accounting year ended 31 March 2020.  If the financial statements are drawn up to 30 June annually, the basis period for the year of assessment 2019/20 will be the accounting year ended 30 June 2019.  If the financial statements are drawn up to 31 December annually, the basis

![ref4]

period for the year of assessment 2019/20 will be the accounting year ended 31 December 2019.   

***Deductible expenses*** 

4. Profits  of  a  person  cannot  be  ascertained  without  considering deduction of outgoings and expenses.   If an expense is a proper deduction in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the expense should be allowed unless the expense is prohibited for deduction under the Ordinance.  The concept of “profits” needs the making of such deductions as generally accepted accounting principles would require: see *Usher’s Wiltshire Brewery Ltd v Bruce* [1914] 6 TC 399, *Atherton v British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd* [1925] 10 TC 155, and *Morley v Lawford* [1928] 14 TC 229. 
4. Section 16 governs the deduction of outgoings and expenses while section 17 disallows certain deductions.   In *CIR v Secan Ltd & Another* (2000) 3 HKCFAR 411, Lord Millett NPJ said that sections 16 and 17 are enacted for the protection of the revenue, not the taxpayer, and section 16 is to be read in a negative sense.   Section 16 permits outgoings and expenses to be deducted only to the extent to which they are incurred in a year of assessment.   If accounting profits, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, have taken into account expenses that are not deductible under the Ordinance, those expenses are to be excluded for tax purposes in order to conform with the Ordinance. 

   **RELEVANCE OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES *Accrual accounting*** 

6. For  profits  tax  purposes,  the  application  of  generally  accepted accounting principles to the transactions of the trade or business is the starting point  for  computing  assessable  profits.   In  general,  financial  statements prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  will provide the practical basis for computing assessable profits. 
6. Since accrual accounting is the fundamental concept which underpins the preparation of financial statements, revenue and expenses are recognised even if receipts and payments occur in a different period.   The point at which revenue is recognised is usually the same point at which any related expenses are recognised. 
8. In buying and selling of goods, the cost of the purchases is usually carried as inventories in the statement of financial position until such time as the inventories are sold and the related revenue is recognised.   Inventories are then recognised as cost of sales and thus an expense. 
8. Revenue is derived or earned when goods are sold or services are provided (i.e. promised goods or services are transferred) and is measured at the amount  of  consideration  a  person  expects  to  be  entitled  in  exchange  for transferring promised goods or services.   Accordingly, when sales are made in an accounting period, the sale price should normally be brought into account for profits tax purposes in that period even if the proceeds are not received until after the end of the period subject to a possible provision for bad debts. 
8. The Commissioner normally does not accept cash basis since profits from trading or business are recognised on an accrual basis.   Thus, profits recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are normally taken as profits “arisen” or “derived” for the purposes of section 14 provided that the accrual is not “anticipatory” but made to reflect the existence of a contract of sale. 

***Interaction between accountancy and tax laws*** 

11. While  profits  computed  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted accounting principles form the starting point for the computation of assessable profits, adjustments to those profits may need to be made to conform with tax laws (i.e. the Ordinance and the relevant judicial interpretations).   Adjustments may also be needed to give effect to more general tax principles (e.g. profits of a capital nature) to tax the full amount of the profits of the trade, profession or business.** 
11. The courts in the United Kingdom have been increasingly reluctant to override generally accepted accounting principles: see the judgments in *Threlfall v Jones* [1993] 66 TC 77, *Johnston v Britannia Airways Ltd* [1994] 67 TC 99 and, specifically on the timing of receipts, *Symons v Lord Llewelyn-Davies’ Personal Representative and Others* [1982] 56 TC 630.   In particular, they have been especially unready to override accounting treatment, which in commercial terms is the only acceptable treatment: see the observations of the Master of the Rolls in *Threlfall v Jone*s at page 123.*** 
13. The Court of Final Appeal’s judgment in *CIR v Secan Ltd & Another* (2000) 3 HKCFAR 411 is the highest authority in Hong Kong on the relevance of commercial accounting principles in ascertaining profits for the purposes of section 14.   Lord Millett NPJ held that profits and losses must be ascertained in accordance with the ordinary principles of commercial accounting as modified to conform with the[ Ordinance.](https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1518314&crid=74c2b2de-1a3a-4e71-8036-236c9333d261&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fanalytical-materials-hk%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5V91-4DN1-FGJR-2403-00000-00&pdscrollreferenceid=HKEFP.V26.TR.19&pdtocnodeidentifier=AAVAABAACAAEAADAAB&ecomp=ydghk&prid=baa92f38-184e-4420-9d2a-59ed6438eb85)   Where the financial statements of a person are correctly drawn in accordance with such principles and in conformity with the Ordinance, no further modifications are required or permitted.   
13. In the United Kingdom, this principle was reaffirmed by the House of Lords  in  *Revenue  and  Customs  Commissioners  v  William  Grant  &  Sons Distillers Ltd* [2007] 1 WLR 1448 at page 1458 per Lord Hope of Craighead who also adopted Sir Thomas Bingham MR’s observation in *Gallagher v Jones* [1994] Ch 107 that the principles of commercial accountancy are not static but so long as they remain current and generally accepted, they provide the surest guide to the question that the legislation requires to be answered.   

***Application of accounting principles*** 

15. Whilst  accounting  principles  are  relevant  to  the  ascertainment  of assessable profits, their application is subject to several considerations: 
1) the court will have recourse to the evidence of accountants in determining  what  the  correct  principles  of  commercial accounting are and has to make a final decision as to whether such  practice  corresponds  to  the  correct  principles  of commercial  accountancy,  as  there  may  be  a  divergence  of views  between  accountants  or  there  may  be  alternative principles[^1]; 
1) the court will always have the last word though great weight 

   would be attached to the view of the accounting profession[^2] and the court would not regard itself as being bound by the evidence of accountants as it would be wrong to do so[^3]; 

3) the principles of commercial accountancy must yield not only to statutory provisions, but also to any overriding principle of tax law[^4].  

***Two cardinal principles*** 

16. In *Nice Cheer Investment Ltd v CIR* (2013) 16 HKCFAR 813, Lord Millett NPJ at the Court of Final Appeal clarified the expression “in conformity with the Ordinance” and elaborated what constitutes taxable profits within the meaning  of  the  Ordinance.   Lord  Millett  NPJ  said  there  are  two  cardinal principles of tax law: “profits” connotes actual or realised and not potential or anticipated profits; and neither profits nor losses may be anticipated[^5]. 

    **GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES *Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards*** 

17. For the purposes of computing the full amount of profits arisen or derived in the basis period for a  year of assessment, the relevant generally accepted accounting principles can be found in Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS), including both Standards (i.e. HKFRS and Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKAS)) and Interpretations (i.e. Hong Kong (IFRIC) Interpretations,  Hong  Kong  Interpretations  and  Hong  Kong  (SIC) Interpretations),  published  by  the  Hong  Kong  Institute  of  Certified  Public Accountants (HKICPA).   
18. For small and medium-sized entities and private entities, the relevant generally accepted accounting principles can be found in *Small and Medium- Sized Entity Financial Reporting Framework and Financial Reporting Standard* (SME-FRF & SME-FRS) and *Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standard for Private Entities* (HKFRS for Private Entities).   
18. HKFRS determine generally accepted accounting principles in Hong Kong  and  set  out  recognition,  measurement,  presentation  and  disclosure requirements dealing with transactions and events that are important in general purpose financial statements.   HKFRS are based on the *Conceptual Framework for  Financial  Reporting*,  which  addresses  the  concepts  underlying  the information presented in general purpose financial statements.   

***New or revised standards*** 

20. From time to time, new or revised standards will be developed to address new and changing transactions and events, or improve the standards by removing  options,  developing  better  treatments  and  addressing  issues  more specifically.   A new  or revised standard will determine  generally  accepted accounting principles in Hong Kong from the date the new or revised standard becomes effective.   

    ***HKFRS applicable to Hong Kong incorporated companies*** 

21. Companies incorporated in Hong Kong are required under Part 9 of the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) to prepare annual financial statements which  are  in  compliance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Section  380(4)(b)  of  the  Companies  Ordinance  requires  that  the  financial statements  of  a  financial  year  must  comply  with  the  accounting  standards applicable to the financial statements.   A company which prepares financial statements in compliance with HKFRS is required to  make an explicit and unreserved statement of such compliance in the notes to the financial statements.  Where a company, in an extremely rare circumstance, concludes that compliance with a requirement in an HKFRS would be so misleading that it would conflict with the objective of financial statements set out in the *Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting*, the company may depart from that requirement by making necessary disclosures. 

    ***Standards applicable to non-Hong Kong incorporated companies*** 

22. For companies incorporated outside Hong Kong, including branches, which  carry  on  business  in  Hong  Kong,  their  financial  statements  may  be prepared in accordance with financial reporting standards which vary from those in Hong Kong (e.g. HKFRS).   The Commissioner would generally accept an accounting treatment which is in accordance with the relevant financial reporting standard  of  the  “home”  jurisdiction  or  International  Financial  Reporting Standards  issued  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board,  and  is consistent with the true facts or otherwise apt to determine the true profits or losses of the business.   Though the financial reporting standards of the “home” jurisdiction may be accepted for determining the accounting profits or losses, such profits or losses would be subject to the requirement of conformity with the tax laws. 

***Financial statements required to give a true and fair view*** 

23. The requirement for the assessable profits of a trade or business to be computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles does not, in itself, impose any  audit requirement.   Companies formed and registered under the Companies Ordinance, however, must have their financial statements audited  unless  they  are  dormant.   A  company  must  keep  such  accounting records  as  will  enable  its  directors  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the Companies Ordinance. 
23. The  auditor’s  report,  where  required,  must  state  whether  in  the auditor’s  opinion  the  financial  statements  have  been  properly  prepared  in compliance with the Companies Ordinance and give a true and fair view of the financial performance and financial position of the company if the company does not fall within the reporting exemption for the financial year.   If the financial statements do not represent a true and fair view, the auditor must qualify the report  accordingly.   In  practice,  the  application  of  the  principal  qualitative characteristics under the *Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting* and of appropriate accounting standards (i.e. HKFRS and HKFRS for Private Entities), with  additional  disclosure  when  necessary,  normally  results  in  financial statements that give what is generally understood as a true and fair view of, or as presenting fairly such information. 
25. Private companies or companies limited by guarantee which qualify for reporting exemption under section 359 of the Companies Ordinance and take advantage of the reporting exemption are exempt from the requirement for their financial statements to give a true and fair view.   Instead of preparing financial statements under the fair presentation framework, companies taking advantage of the reporting exemption are required to prepare their financial statements in accordance with SME-FRF & SME-FRS as these are the applicable accounting standards  for  such  companies  for  the  purposes  of  complying  with  section 380(4)(b) of the Companies Ordinance. 

    ***Profits tax return*** 

26. When submitting a profits tax return, a company must attach certified copies of its audited financial statements if required by the Board of Inland Revenue.   Without the audited financial statements, the profits tax return will not be accepted as being complete and the company will not be accepted as having complied with the filing obligation under the Ordinance.   The company may be subject to penal action if the audited financial statements cannot be submitted before the filing deadline.   An estimated assessment may be raised on the company if the company is considered to be chargeable to profits tax. 

    **PART B: REVENUE RECOGNITION** 

    **REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS *Objective of HKFRS 15*** 

27. HKFRS 15 *Revenue from Contracts with Customers*[^6]  was issued to replace a number of Standards and Interpretations [^7].   The  objective of this standard is to establish the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer. It provides comprehensive guidance to be applied in order to recognise revenue from contracts with customers.   It considers goods and services provided in a contract to be performance obligations that must be satisfied before revenue can be recognised.   It was issued with an effective date of 1 January 2017 which was later revised to 1 January 2018.  
27. While appropriate adjustments are still required to be made for profits tax purposes, the introduction of HKFRS 15 has brought in certainty and clarity regarding the recognition of profits for both accounting and profits tax purposes.  Under HKFRS 15, revenue is recognised when performance obligations of the contract  are  satisfied  (i.e.  when  control  of  the  goods  or  services  has  been transferred to the customer).   In contrast, profits tax is charged when the profit is derived and the expense is incurred.   In practice, the difference, if any, should not be significant since the five-step approach under HKFRS 15 means that the accounting treatment follows a substance-based approach which is based on the transfer of control of the goods or services.   Appendix 1 gives an overview of HKFRS 15.  

    ***Five-step revenue recognition model under HKFRS 15*** 

29. The core principle of HKFRS 15* is that an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that  reflects  the  consideration  to  which  the  entity  expects  to  be  entitled  in exchange  for  those  goods  or  services.   An  entity  recognises  revenue  in accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps: 
1) Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer; 
1) Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract; 
1) Step 3: Determine the transaction price; 
1) Step  4:  Allocate  the  transaction  price  to  the  performance obligations in the contract; and 
1) Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 

A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations.   A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer to the customer either a good or service or a bundle of goods or services that is distinct, or a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.  When  an  entity  transfers  promised  goods  or  services  to  a  customer,  the transaction price is the amount of consideration in a contract to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer. 

30. Regarding  construction  contracts,  and  pre-completion  sale  and purchase  agreements  for  units  in  multi-storey  residential  buildings,  the application of the revenue recognition principles under HKFRS 15 is explained in Appendices 2 and 3.   Small and medium-sized entities and private entities, which fulfill the criteria for reporting under SME-FRF & SME-FRS and HKFRS for Private Entities, should recognise revenue from such contracts or agreements in accordance with: 
1) section 8 (Construction Contracts) or section 11 (Revenue) of SME-FRF & SME-FRS; or 
2) section 23 (Revenue) of HKFRS for Private Entities. 

***Performance obligation satisfied over time or at a point in time*** 

31. Under HKFRS 15, revenue should be recognised when performance obligation is satisfied (i.e. control of the promised good or service of a contract is obtained by the customer).   The customer has control of the promised good or service when the customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the good or service by the use, consumption, sale or exchange, pledging and holding of the good or service.   In practice, if a person has recognised a revenue under Step 5, the Commissioner would  regard  the  revenue  as  having  been  realised  (i.e.  the  revenue  is  not anticipated) and such revenue should be included as the assessable profits of the person.     
31. At contract inception, it has to be determined whether the performance obligation  is  satisfied  over  time  or  at  a  point  in  time  in  accordance  with paragraphs  35  to  38  of  HKFRS  15.   If  the  performance  obligation  is  not satisfied  over  time,  it  is  satisfied  at  a  point  in  time.   For  the  purposes  of determining the point in time at which a customer obtains control of the good or service, the indicators of the transfer of control taken into account should include, but not limited to, the following:  
1) the person has a present right to payment for the good or service; 
1) the customer has legal title to the good or service;  
1) the person has transferred physical possession of the good or service; 
1) the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the good or service; and 
1) the customer has accepted the good or service.   

The indicators are usually present if the customer has the control of the good or service.   However, the indicators are not individually determinative and they are not a list of conditions that have to be met.   The nature of the good or service in question and the terms of the contract would generally determine which indicators of the transfer of the control would be of relevance.  

***HKFRS 15 for computing assessable profits*** 

33. When applying HKFRS 15, the terms of the contract entered into with the customer and all relevant facts and circumstances have to be considered.  Given HKFRS 15 provides the generally accepted accounting principles for recognition of revenue, the Commissioner would accept that accounting profits determined in accordance with HKFRS 15 would form the starting point for computing  assessable  profits.   The  examples  in  this  Practice  Note  are  not intended to comprehensively address all possible tax issues that may arise.   It should not be assumed that the examples will provide a definite answer in every case.   Each example addresses the tax issues in relation to the specific facts given. 

Example 1 

*Company-HK developed a new computer equipment which would not function or be sold without an operating software.   On 1 January 2019, Company-HK entered into a contract with a customer for selling the computer equipment for $4,000,000.   The contract with two-year maintenance  services,  which  covered  parts,  labour  and  software repairs, would commence upon delivery of the computer equipment.  On 1 February 2019, the computer equipment was delivered to the customer.   Company-HK  determined  that  the  stand-alone  selling prices  at  contract  inception  were:  $3,500,000  for  the  computer equipment and the operating software (as a bundle); and $500,000 for the maintenance services.   Company-HK closed its accounts on 31 December annually.*    

The five-step revenue recognition model under HKFRS 15 would need to be applied as follows: 

*Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer* 

1) Company-HK would be required to account for the contract since the five criteria in paragraph 9 of HKFRS 15 are met (i.e. contract  approved  and  performance  obligations  committed; rights  regarding  the  equipment  and  services  identified; payment  terms  for  the  equipment  and  services  identified; commercial  substance  found;  and  consideration  entitled collectable).     

*Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract* 

2) In the sale contract, there were two performance obligations: transfer of the computer equipment and operating software; and provision of two-year maintenance services.   Since benefits could not be obtained from the computer equipment without the operating software, the computer equipment and operating software were not distinct goods and the promises regarding their  transfer  could  not  be  treated  as  separate  performance obligations.      

*Step 3: Determine the transaction price* 

3) Transaction price of $4,000,000 fixed in the sale contract was the  consideration  that  Company-HK  would  expect  to  be entitled to in exchange for transferring the computer equipment and operating software, and the maintenance services to the customer.*  

*Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract* 

4) $4,000,000 should be allocated to each of the performance obligations in the contract based on the relative stand-alone selling price.   $3,500,000 and $500,000 should be allocated to the  computer  equipment  and  operating  software,  and  the maintenance services respectively.* 

*Step 5: Recognise revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied* 

5) Revenue  from  the  sale  of  the  computer  equipment  and 

   operating software should be recognised at a point in time since none of the criteria in paragraph 35 of HKFRS 15 was met. Revenue  of  $3,500,000  should  be  recognised  in  Company- HK’s accounts for the year ended 31 December 2019 upon delivery.   Revenue  from  the  provision  of  maintenance services should be recognised over time since the customer would  consume  and  receive  benefit  from  the  maintenance services over a two-year period (i.e. 1 February 2019 to 31 January 2021).   Revenue of $500,000 would be recognised in Company-HK’s accounts for the  years ended 31 December 2019, 2020 and 2021 using an appropriate basis for measuring progress towards completion of the maintenance services. 

   For  profits  tax  purposes,  the  revenue  as  recognised  in  the accounting periods for the years ended 31 December 2019, 2020 and 2021 would be regarded as having arisen or been derived under section 18B in the years of assessment 2019/20, 2020/21 and 2021/22 respectively.   Expenses, which satisfied the deduction rules under sections 16 and 17 and were incurred in  the  production  of  the  revenue  for  the  years  ended  31 December 2019, 2020 and 2021, would be matched against the revenue to arrive at the assessable profits of Company-HK for the years of assessment 2019/20, 2020/21 and 2021/22.  

***Variable consideration*** 

34. Where a contract includes variable consideration (e.g. price discounts, rebates, incentives and performance bonuses), a person has to recognise variable consideration as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty related to the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.   For profits tax purposes, the Commissioner takes the view that the variable  consideration  recognised  as  revenue  in  such  a  situation  would  be regarded as having been realised and the resulting profits after deduction of expenses would be assessed accordingly.

![ref5]Example 15 

*Bank-HK entered into a contract to help a customer with an equity placement.   Bank-HK  determined  at  contract  inception  that  the performance obligation would be satisfied at a point in time upon completion of the equity placement.   In addition to a fixed fee of $10 million, Bank-HK would receive a bonus of $1 million if the placement was successful.   Bank-HK determined that the most likely amount provided the best estimation of the amount of consideration to which it would be entitled though there would be a 75% chance that the placement would be successful and a 25% chance that it would be unsuccessful.*       

If the most likely amount was adopted, the variable consideration that Bank-HK expected to be entitled to would be $1 million.   Since the payment of the bonus was highly susceptible to market volatility, which was outside the control of Bank-HK and the customer, it would be concluded that the variable consideration should be constrained to zero  until  the  equity  placement  was  completed.   For  profits  tax purposes, the variable consideration of $1 million would be regarded as having been realised when the equity placement was completed (i.e. tax treatment and accounting treatment of the variable consideration are the same).

***Significant financing component*** 

35. Where the timing of payment agreed in the contract provides a person or the person’s customer with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of the good or service, an adjustment of the compromised consideration for the effects of the time value of money is required and the effects of financing (i.e. interest revenue or interest expense) are presented separately from revenue from contracts with customers. 
35. Though notional interest revenue or interest expense are recognised in the financial statements in accordance with HKFRS 15, there is no actual interest receipt or interest payment.   A person receiving advance payments from a customer has no obligation or accrued liability to pay interest to the customer whereas a person receiving deferred payments from a customer does not have

![ref6]

any right, legal or contractual, to receive interest  from the customer.   The Commissioner therefore takes the view that such interest revenue and interest expense are notional constructs made solely for complying with the accounting requirements of HKFRS 15 and should not be brought to tax.   

37. For profits tax purposes: 
1) any sum recognised as notional interest revenue as required under HKFRS 15 for deferred payments made by a customer should be recognised as part of the revenue derived from sale of the good or service in the year of assessment in which the good or service is transferred to the customer;
1) any sum recognised as notional interest expense as required under HKFRS 15 for advance payments made by a customer should be ignored and the cash payment received upfront (i.e. without any notional interest expense) should be recognised as revenue derived from sale of the good or service in the year of assessment in which the good or service is transferred to the customer.

In  the  tax  computations,  tax  adjustments  relating  to  significant  financing components have to be made and clearly disclosed. 

Example 3 

*On 1 January 2018, Company-HK sold Product A to a customer with delivery on that same day.   It was agreed in the contract that the price of $500,000 would be deferred for payment until 31 December 2019.   The incremental borrowing rate of Company-HK was 5%.  Company-HK closed its accounts on 31 December each year.   Given that  the  contract  contained  a  significant  financing  component, Company-HK accounted for the revenue and significant financing component in accordance with HKFRS 15 as follows:*
