INTRODUCTION

Whereas  expenditure  of  a  capital  nature  is  generally  not  deductible,
section  18F  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  (the  Ordinance)  provides  for  the
assessable  profits  of  a  person  for  any  year  of  assessment  to  be  decreased  by  the
amount of any allowances made to the person under Part VI of the Ordinance, and
to be increased by the amount of any balancing charge directed to be made on the
person under the same Part. The relevant allowances and charges apply in respect
of  certain  (a)  industrial  buildings  and  structures;  (b)  commercial  buildings  and
structures; and (c) machinery and plant.

2.
This Departmental Interpretation & Practice Note (DIPN) is concerned
with  the  provisions  of  Part  VI  relating  to  (A)  industrial  buildings  and  structures,
and  (B)  commercial  buildings  and  structures.  The  provisions  concerning
machinery and plant are discussed in DIPN No. 7 (Revised).

PART A : INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS ALLOWANCES

Trades Which Qualify

The term “industrial building or structure” is defined, for the purposes
3.
of Part VI, in section 40(1) of the Ordinance and commences with the following
enumeration -

“  “industrial  building  or  structure”  means  any  building  or  structure  or
part of any building or structure used -

(a)

for the purposes of a trade carried on in a mill, factory or other
similar premises; or

(b)

for  the  purposes  of  a  transport,  tunnel,  dock,  water,  gas  or
telephonic  or  public
electricity  undertaking  or  a  public
telegraphic service; or

(c)

for the purposes of a trade which consists of the manufacture of
goods or materials or the subjection of goods or materials to any
process; or

(d)

for the purposes of a trade which consists in the storage -

(i)  	 of  goods  or  materials  which  are  to  be  used  in  the

manufacture of other goods or materials; or

(ii)  	 of  goods  or  materials  which  are  to  be  subjected  in  the

course of a trade to any process; or

(iii)  of goods or materials on their arrival into Hong Kong; or

(e)

for the purposes of the business of farming; or

(f)

for  the  purposes  of  scientific  research  in  relation  to  any  trade,
profession or business, ...” [“profession” has been included with
effect from the year of assessment 1998/99.]

4.
It should be noted that for a building or structure (or part of a building
or structure) to  qualify, it must  be used for the purposes of a trade,  undertaking,
service, business or profession as specified in paragraphs (a) to (f) of the definition,
and  not  be  excluded  under  the  proviso  to  the  definition.  In  this  regard  it  is
pertinent that except for paragraphs (b), (e) and (f), only trades qualify. It should
not be thought that a building or structure can only qualify under (c) if it is used
for  the  purposes  of  a  trade  which  involves  a  manufacturing  process;  allowances
may also be granted if the trade consists of the subjection of goods or materials to
any process.

5.
Guidance  in  relation  to  the  question  of  whether  a  trade  consists  of  the
subjection  of  goods  or  materials  to  any  process  can  be  obtained  from  the  High
Court decision in the case of CIR v. Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises Ltd (1988) 2
HKTC  330.  One  of  the  issues  considered  in  the  case  was  whether  a  floating
restaurant qualified as an industrial structure. The main thrust of the argument for
the  taxpayer  was  that  cooking  of  food  amounted  to  the  subjection  of  goods  or

material to a process or processes. In considering the issue, Jones J. referred to the
Judgement of the Court of Appeal in Vibroplant Ltd. v. Holland [1982] 54 TC 658
where  it  was  accepted,  in  relation  to  the  equivalent  provision  in  the  United
Kingdom’s  legislation,  that  “‘process’  connotes  a  substantial  measure  of
uniformity of treatment or system of treatment.”. Jones J. went on to hold that the
restaurant boat did not qualify for the allowances. In doing so he said, at pages 351
and 352, -

“ However, does the preparation and cooking of food come within the
definition  of  the  subjection  of  goods  to  any  process.  “Process”  is
defined in the shorter Oxford Dictionary inter alia as “a continuous and
regular  action  or  succession  of  actions,  taking  place  or  carried  on  in a
definite manner; a continuous (natural or artificial) operation or series of
operations. A particular method of operation in any manufacture.”

From  the  authorities,  it  is  clear  that  in  order  to  determine  whether  a
building is an industrial building or structure, it is necessary to look at
the legislation to ascertain its meaning. The words of the section show
that the legislature intended allowances to be claimed by those engaged
in the manufacture of goods or in the subjection of goods to a process.
A restaurant has been described in the Rael-Brook case [(1967) 2 Q.B.
65]  as  a  service  industry,  but  it  is  plain  that  it  is  not  a  manufacturing
industry. Nor, as was submitted by Mr Feenstra, is it akin to a factory or
mill  but  rather  to  a  retail  shop.  Again,  I  am  unable  to  agree  that  the
cooking of food results in a uniformity of treatment as urged upon me
by Mrs Clough. Each individual dish  is  prepared  separately  depending
on  the  order  placed  by  the  customer.  I  can  see  no  distinction  between
the cooking of food and the carrying out of the repairs in the Vibroplant
case [(1982) 42 T.C. 658]. Repairs have no uniformity and are different
in the same way as the cooking of food. It is again far removed from the
Kilmarnock  case  [(1966)  42  T.C.  675]  which  encompassed  a  definite
process and a trade of manufacturing. ...

I do not consider that the legislation was ever intended to extend to the
business  of  a  restaurant.  The  trade  of  the  restaurant  has  nothing  to  do
with  manufacturing  or  processing.  Accordingly,  I  am  satisfied  that  the

restaurant  boat  and  kitchen  boat,  three  bridges  or  gangways  do  not
qualify  for  the  allowances  for  they  are  not  industrial  buildings  or
structures. ”

The  following  are  examples  regarded  as  satisfying  the  test  of

6.
“subjection of goods or materials to any process” -

•

•

•

•

an explosives shed used in the trade of quarrying and mining;

buildings used in the trade of motion picture procedures;

buildings  used  for  the  purposes  of  the  trade  of  fumigation  and
extermination (i.e. pest control which might be performed outside
of  the  premises)  -  see  Hong  Kong  Inland  Revenue  Board  of
Review decisions D3/87 and D4/87, Volume 2, page 329; and

buildings  used  to  screen  and  pack  coal  for  sale  –  Kilmarnock
Equitable Co-operative Society Ltd. v. CIR, 42 T.C. 675.

7.
test in question -

The following are examples of buildings which would not satisfy the

•

•

buildings  used  for  wage  packeting,  as  notes  and  coins  held  as
currency  are  not  goods  for  processing  -  Buckingham  v.  Securties
Properties ltd., 53 T.C. 292; and

buildings  used  by  banks  for  processing  cheques  and  other
documents,  as  these  are  not  regarded  as  “goods  or  materials”  –
Girobank plc v. Clarke, 1998 S.T.C. 182.

Storage

8.
In order to come within paragraph (d) of the definition, the trade itself
must  be  one  of  storage.  Godowns  or  warehouses  for  the  storage  of  goods  or
materials which are to be sold by the storer or are for use or consumption within
the trade of the storer would not rank for industrial building allowances under this
paragraph.

Part of a Trade

9.
There is no provision in the Ordinance for making an allowance where
only part of a trade qualifies. In a case heard by the Supreme Court of Hong Kong,
Tai On Machinery Works Ltd. v. C.I.R. [H.K.T.C. 411], allowances were refused
to  a  retail  distributor  of  goods  who  claimed  to  have  subjected  the  goods  to  a
process, it being held that the alleged processing was, at best, part of the trade and
not the trade itself.

Buildings Which  Qualify

10.
The  allowances  can  apply  to  all  buildings  and  structures  used  in
qualifying  trades,  other  than  categories  specifically  excluded  by  the  second
proviso  to  the  definition  of  “industrial  building  or  structure”  (see  paragraph  15
below).

11.
The  words  “building”  and  “structure”,  which  are  not  defined  in  the
Ordinance, are construed as having their ordinary meanings. In practice the term
“structure”  is  interpreted  as  covering  artificial  works  that  are  not  commonly
regarded  as  buildings,  such  as  walls,  bridges,  dams,  roads,  bore  holes  and  wells,
sewers,  water  mains,  tunnel  linings  and  wharves.  In  addition,  the  practice  is  to
regard  boundary  walls,  railway  sidings  and  other  works  forming  part  of  the
premises as qualifying for the allowances.

12.
Any  buildings  or  structures  provided  for  and  in  use  for  the  welfare  of
workers,  or  for  the  housing  of  manual  workers,  employed  in  a  specified  trade,
undertaking or business will also rank for allowances.

Part of a Building or Structure

13.
The  definition  of  “industrial  building  or  structure”  includes  part  of  a
building  or  structure.  Where  a  building  or  structure  is  used  only  partly  for  the
purposes  of  a  qualifying  trade,  only  the  relevant  proportion  of  the  capital
expenditure  will  generally  qualify  for  allowances.  However,  proviso  (i)  to  the
definition stipulates that where the capital expenditure on the part of the building
or  structure  which  is  not  an  industrial  building  or  structure  does  not  exceed

onetenth of the total capital expenditure, the whole building shall be treated as an
industrial building or structure.

When  additions  are  made  to  an  existing  building,  the  expenditure

14.
incurred ranks for separate allowances.

Buildings Excluded

15.
The second proviso to the definition of “industrial building or structure”
excludes  from  the  meaning  of  the  term  any  building  or  structure,  or  part  of  any
building or structure, used as a -

(i)

	dwelling house (other than as a dwelling house for the housing of
manual workers),

(ii)

retail shop,

(iii)

showroom,

(iv)

hotel, or

(v)

	office.

It should, however, be kept in mind that even if part of a building is excluded by
virtue of this proviso, the remainder of the building, or some part of it, may still
qualify (see paragraph 13 above).

Capital Expenditure Incurred on Construction

16.
The allowances (which are granted under sections 34 and 35) are based
on  the  capital  expenditure  incurred  on  the  construction  of  the  building  (or
structure).  Such  expenditure  does  not  include  the  cost  of  the  site  or  that  of  the
preparation  and  levelling  of  the  land.  However,  it  can  include  expenditure  on
ordinary  work  done  preparatory  to  laying  foundations,  and  on  laying  drains,
sewers and water-mains to serve the building or structure.

17.
The allowable expenditure does not include anything that is reimbursed
by any grant, subsidy, or similar financial assistance, or any expenditure which is
deductible  under  Part  IV  of  the  Ordinance  (e.g.  expenditure  on  building
refurbishment under section 16F). On the other hand, it includes interest paid and
any  commitment  fee  incurred  in  respect  of  a  loan  obtained  for  the  purpose  of
providing an industrial building.

Persons Entitled to the Allowances

Allowances are granted to any person who is entitled to an interest in an
18.
industrial  building,  where  that  interest  is  the  relevant  interest  (see  paragraph  21
below)  in  relation  to  the  capital  expenditure  incurred  on  the  construction  of  that
building.

19.
It is not necessary for the building to be used for a qualifying purpose
by  the  owner  himself.  Accordingly,  where  a  building  is  leased  and  used  by  the
occupant  for  a  qualifying  purpose,  the  landlord,  being  the  person  having  the
relevant interest in the capital expenditure incurred on construction, is entitled to
the allowances.

20.
No  allowances  are  due  to  a  lessee  who  merely  pays  rent  and/or  a
premium  for  the  lease  of  a  building  and  who  has  not  himself  incurred  capital
expenditure on construction or acquired the relevant interest of a person who did
incur  such  expenditure.  However,  a  tenant  who  incurs expenditure on a building
which  he  occupies  for  the  purposes  of  a  qualifying  trade,  profession  or  business
will have a relevant interest for the purposes of the allowances.

Relevant Interest

21.
expenditure is incurred. It is defined in section 40(1) in the following terms -

“Relevant  Interest”  is  determined  at  the  time  when  the  capital

“  “relevant  interest”  means,  in  relation  to  any  expenditure  incurred  on
the construction of a building or structure the interest in that building or
structure to which the person who incurred the expenditure was entitled
when he incurred it; ”

22.
A relevant interest can be acquired where the person who incurred the
expenditure  sells  the  whole  of  his  interest  in  (i)  the  building,  or  (ii)  part  of  the
building. For example, A holds a lease of land from the HKSAR Government for
99  years.  He  gives  B  a  lease  for  50  years  and  B  erects  an  industrial  building
thereon at a cost of $10M. After some time B assigns the balance of his lease to C,
who acquires the relevant interest which B had in the capital expenditure incurred
on the construction of the building. C is entitled to annual allowances calculated
under  section  34(2)(b),  and  also  to  balancing  allowances  at  the  expiration  of  the
lease under section 35(1)(b). If, however, B merely sub-let the premises to C for a
term of years (i.e. the sub-lease expires before the end of B’s lease from A), the
relevant  interest  would  not  pass  and  C  would  not  be  entitled  to  any  industrial
building  allowance.  B,  however,  having  retained  the  relevant  interest  would
continue to be entitled to the allowances, provided C is carrying on a qualifying
trade, profession or business.

Buildings and Structures Bought Unused

Where capital expenditure is incurred on the construction of a building
23.
and before it is used, the relevant interest therein is sold, section 35B provides that
-

(a) 	 no allowances may be claimed in respect of that expenditure by the
seller  and  any  initial  allowances  already  made  under  section  34
shall  be  withdrawn,  with  additional  assessments  raised
if
necessary;

(b)  	 the  person  who  buys  that  interest  is  deemed  to  have  incurred,  on
the  date  on  which  the  purchase  price  is  payable,  capital
expenditure on construction of an amount equal to -

(i)

the  net  price  paid  by  the  purchaser  for  that  interest  if  the
interest is sold by a builder or developer in the course of his
trade; and

(ii)

in  any  other  case,  the  lesser  of  the  net  price  paid  by  the
purchaser for that interest or the actual cost of construction.

24.
Should  there  be  more  than  one  sale  before  the  building  is  used,  (b)
above applies only in relation to the last sale so that the final purchaser who uses
the building is entitled to the allowances. In the case of (b)(i), the final purchaser
would get allowances based on the lesser of the net price of the first sale or the net
price  paid  by  him  (see  the  proviso  to  section  35B).  For  example,  in  1996  D
constructs a building at a cost of $10M and sells it to E for a net price of $15M. E
then sells it to F for a net price of $14M. F uses the building in his qualifying trade.
Then,  F  would  be  the  person  entitled  to  the  allowances calculated on an amount
depending on whether D carries on a building trade and has sold the building in
the ordinary course of his trade. If so, the allowances will be granted on $14M, the
lesser of the net price paid by F and the net price of the first sale. In any other case,
F  would  only  be  entitled  to  allowances  based  on  $10M,  being  the  actual  cost  of
construction which is less than the net price of $14M paid by him.

The “net price” referred to in the two previous paragraphs excludes, of

25.
course, the price of the land on which the building stands.

Initial Allowance

Since the 1965/66 year of assessment, section 34(1) has provided for an
26.
initial  allowance  of  one-fifth  of  the  capital  expenditure  incurred  on  the
construction  of  an industrial building to be made to the person who incurred the
expenditure. The allowance is made for the year of assessment in the basis period
for which the expenditure was incurred.

27.
Initial  allowance  is  granted  as  expenditure  is  incurred,  and  there  is  no
requirement that the building must be in use. However, proviso (b) to section 34(1)
stipulates  that  any  initial  allowance  made  under  the  section  before  a  building  is
used  shall  be  disallowed  (and  appropriate  additional  assessments  made)  if  the
building is not an industrial building when it first comes to be used.

28.
Where the cost of construction is paid in instalments, initial allowance is
made  by  reference  to  the  instalments  due  for  payment  in  the  basis  period  of  the
year of assessment under consideration.

Annual Allowance

29.
Since  the  1965/66  year  of  assessment,  annual  allowances  have  been
computed in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 34(2). Where the
person claiming the allowance incurred the capital expenditure on the construction
of the building, the annual allowance is 4% of the capital expenditure. However, if
the person acquired the building after the capital expenditure on construction had
been incurred (i.e. it was sold as an existing industrial building), the calculation of
the allowance for the purchaser depends on when the building was first used as an
industrial building, -

(a)  	 if  first used before the commencement of the basis period for the
year of assessment commencing on 1 April 1965, the allowance is
calculated  by  reference  to  the  “residue  of  expenditure”  (see
paragraph 31 below) immediately after the sale. The allowance is
arrived  at  by  multiplying  the  residue  of  expenditure  by  two  and
dividing the resulting figure by the number of years of assessment
comprised  in  the  period  which  begins  with  the  first  year  of
assessment for which the buyer is entitled to an annual allowance
(or  would  be  so  entitled  if  the  building  had  at  all  material  times
continued  to  be  an  industrial  building),  and  ends  with  the  fiftieth
year after the year in which the building was first used; or

(b)  	 if  first  used  on  or  after  the  commencement  basis  period  for  the
year of assessment commencing on 1 April 1965, the allowance is
arrived at by dividing the residue of expenditure by the number of
years of assessment comprised in the period which begins with the
first year of assessment for which the buyer is entitled to an annual
allowance  (or  would  be  so  entitled  if  the  building  had  at  all
material  times  continued  to  be  an  industrial  building),  and  ends
with the twenty-fifth year after the year of assessment in which the
building was first used.

30.
annual allowance in respect of an industrial building for any year of assessment -

Two  conditions  must  be  satisfied  before  a  person  becomes  entitled  to

(a)

the building must be in use as an industrial building at the end of
the person’s basis period for the year assessment; and

(b)  	 the person must be entitled to an interest in the building at the end
of  the  basis  period  for  the  year  of  assessment  (and  that  interest
must be the relevant interest in relation to  the capital expenditure
for which the allowance is claimed).

Residue of Expenditure

31.
The  term  “residue  of  expenditure”  is  defined  in  section  40(1)  as
meaning  in  relation  to  an  industrial  building,  in  effect,  the  amount  of  the  capital
expenditure incurred on the construction of the building, reduced by the amount of
any initial, annual or balancing allowance made, and increased by any balancing
charge made. The definition of the term also requires that in computing the residue
of expenditure in relation to a building, there shall also be deducted in respect of
any year in which no initial or annual allowance fell to be made (e.g. due to the
building not being used as an industrial building), an amount equal to 2% of the
capital expenditure for each such year prior to the year of assessment commencing
on 1 April 1965, and 4% of the capital expenditure for that year or any subsequent
year of assessment.

Balancing Allowances and Charges

Under  section  35(1),  when  any  of  the  following  events  occurs  to  an

32.
industrial building -

(a)

the relevant interest in the building is sold; or

(b)

that  interest,  being  a  leasehold  interest,  comes  to  an  end
otherwise  than  on  the  person  entitled  thereto  acquiring  the
interest which is reversionary thereon; or

(c)

the  building
demolished or destroyed, ceases altogether to be used,

is  demolished,  destroyed  or,  without  being

a  balance  is  struck  between  the  residue  of  expenditure  immediately  before  the
event  and  the  sale  price,  insurance,  salvage  or  compensation  moneys  (if  any).  If
the residue exceeds the sale price or other moneys, the difference is allowed as a
balancing allowance. If the difference is the other way, it forms a balancing charge.
A  balancing  charge  is  not  to  exceed  the  total  of  initial  and  annual  allowances
previously made to the person.

33.
No  charge  or  allowance  falls  to  be  made  unless  the  building  was  an
industrial  building  at  the  time  of  the  event.  Further,  no  balancing  allowance  is
given where the building is demolished for purposes unconnected with the trade,
profession or business for which the building was used. Thus, for example, where
the land is ripe for re-development, and the building is demolished to enable the
land to be sold unencumbered, no balancing allowance is given, even though the
building was in use as an industrial building immediately prior to demolition.

Termination of a Leasehold Interest

34.
If  a  lessee  has  incurred  capital  expenditure  on  a  building,  a  balancing
allowance  or  charge  does  not  arise  when  the  lease  comes to  an  end  if  the  lessee
remains  in  possession  with  the  consent  of  the  lessor  without  a  new  lease  being
granted. His leasehold interest is treated as continuing (section 35A(a)). If a new
lease is granted to the lessee, or if the old lease is extended by reason of an option
available  to  the  lessee,  the  second  lease  is  treated  as  a  continuation  of  the  first
lease (section 35A(b)). If the lessee buys the property from the lessor during the
currency  of  the  lease,  the  lessee’s  interest  in  any  capital  expenditure  incurred  is
deemed  to  continue  unaltered,  and  accordingly  no  balancing  allowance  is
applicable.

Examples

Examples 1 to 4 of the Appendix illustrate the calculation of allowances

35.
and charges in respect of industrial buildings.

PART B : ALLOWANCES - COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS

Buildings Which  Qualify

For the purposes of Part VI of the Ordinance, a commercial building or

36.
structure is defined in section 40(1) to mean -

“any  building  or  structure  or  part  of  any  building  or  structure  used  by
the person entitled to the relevant interest for the purposes of his trade,
profession or business other than an industrial building or structure;”.

Provided that it is used for an appropriate purpose, part of a building may qualify
as a commercial building (i.e. it is not necessary for the whole building to be used
for a qualifying purpose).

Expenditure Which Qualifies

37.
As  with  industrial  buildings,  the  allowances  granted  in  respect  of
commercial buildings (and structures), under sections 33A, 33B and 36, are based
on the capital expenditure incurred on construction. In this regard, the comments
made  in  paragraphs  16  and  17  of  Part  A  above,  under  the  heading  “Capital
Expenditure Incurred on Construction”, are also pertinent to commercial buildings.
However, it should be noted that section 35B, which is concerned with buildings
bought unused (see  paragraph 23), does not have any application in relation to a
commercial building.

Persons Entitled to the Allowances

An allowance in respect of a commercial building or structure is granted
38.
to a person where at the end of a basis period for a year of assessment the person is
entitled  to  an  interest  in  the  building,  provided  that  the  interest  is  the  “relevant
interest” in relation to the capital expenditure incurred on the construction of the
building.  The  meaning  of  the  term  “relevant  interest”  in  relation  to  commercial
buildings is the same as for industrial buildings (see paragraph 21 above). Prior to
the year of assessment 1969/70, an allowance in respect of a commercial building
could only be made to the owner of the building. From 1969/70, however, a tenant

has  been  able  to  claim  in  respect  of  capital  expenditure  he  has  incurred  on
additions to a building, or for which he has thus acquired the relevant interest.

Rebuilding Allowance - Years  of Assessment Prior to 1998/99

39.
Section 36 provides for an allowance, known as “rebuilding allowance”,
to be granted where at the end of the basis period for a year of assessment prior to
1998/99  a  person  was  entitled  to  an  interest  in  a  commercial  building  and  that
interest was the relevant interest in relation to capital expenditure incurred on the
construction of the building. For each year of assessment from 1990/91 to 1997/98,
the  rebuilding  allowance  is  2%  of  the  capital  expenditure  incurred  on  the
construction  of  the  building.  For  years  of  assessment  prior  to  1990/91,  the
rebuilding allowance rate is 0.75%.

40.
Section 36(2) provides that that no rebuilding allowance may be made
to  a  person  in  respect  of  any  year  of  assessment  after  1997/98  (i.e.  where  “the
basis  period  for  that  year  of  assessment  is  subsequent  to  the basis  period  for  the
year of assessment commencing on 1 April 1997”).

41.
It  should  be  noted  that  for  assessments  in  respect  of  the  1997/98  and
earlier  years  of  assessment,  the  Ordinance  does  not  provide  for  any  balancing
allowance or charge to be made where a person sold or otherwise ceased to use a
commercial building.

Allowances for 1998/99 and Subsequent Years of  Assessment

With effect from the year of assessment 1998/99, rebuilding allowance
42.
ceased  to  be  applicable,  and  was  replaced  by  a  regime  which  is  more  closely
aligned  with  that  for  industrial  buildings  -  it  likewise  provides  for  “annual
allowances”,  “balancing  allowances”  and  “balancing  charges”.  The  amendments
made to the Ordinance to implement the new regime did not affect the meaning of
key  terms  such  as  “commercial  building  or  structure”,  and  “relevant  interest”.
However,  the  definition  of  “residue  of  expenditure”,  which  previously  was  only
relevant  to  industrial  buildings  (see  paragraph  31  above),  was  amended  to  also
have  a  similar  meaning  in  relation  to  commercial  buildings.  In  particular,  the
expression is defined in section 40(1) in the following terms -

“ “residue of expenditure” -

(a)

in relation to a commercial building or structure, means the amount
of  the  capital  expenditure,  incurred  on  the  construction  of  the
building or structure reduced by -

(i)

the amount of any annual allowance made under section 33A;

(iii)  the  amount  of  any  balancing  allowance  made  under  section

33B,

and increased by any balancing charges made under section 33B:

Provided that in computing the residue of expenditure there
shall  be  written  off,  in  respect  of  any  year  in  which  no  annual
allowance  fell  to  be  made  under  section  33A,  an  amount  of
one-twenty-fifth  of  the  capital  expenditure,  and  for  the  purposes  of
this proviso “year” means the period which would have comprised a
year of assessment commencing on 1 April 1998 or any subsequent
year  of  assessment  in  respect  of  which  an  annual  allowance  would
have fallen to be made under section 33A if the building or structure
had been in use as a commercial building or structure; ”

Annual Allowance

Section  33A(1)  provides  for  an  allowance,  known  as  “annual
43.
allowance”,  to  be  made  to  a  person  where  at  the  end  of  the  basis  period  for  the
year of assessment the person “is entitled to an interest in a building or structure
which is a commercial building or structure and where that interest is the relevant
interest in relation to the capital expenditure incurred on the construction of that
building or structure”.

The Most Straightforward Situation

The annual allowance made to a person is computed in accordance with
44.
the terms of section 33A. The most straightforward situation is where the capital
expenditure  on  construction  was  incurred  by  the  person  on  or  after  the

commencement  of  the  basis  period  for  the  year  of  assessment  1998/99  and  the
relevant interest has not been sold by the person. For such a case, section 33A(1)
provides for an annual allowance equal to one-twenty-fifth (i.e. 4%) of the capital
expenditure incurred on the construction of the building. On this basis, and having
regard  to  section  33A(3)  (which  provides,  in  essence,  that  the  annual  allowance
granted for any year of assessment cannot exceed the residue of expenditure prior
to the making of the allowance), the allowance can be claimed for a maximum of
25 years.

Section  33A(2)  and  (4)  cater  for  circumstances  which  vary  from  the
45.
situation described in paragraph 44 above, i.e. they respectively have application
where  the  relevant  interest  has  been  sold  and  where  the  capital  expenditure  was
incurred prior to the commencement of the year of assessment 1998/99.

Where the Commercial Building or Structure Was Constructed Prior to 1998/99

46.
Where the expenditure was incurred prior to the commencement of the
basis period for the year of assessment 1998/99, section 33A(4) has application. In
this situation, for the purpose of calculating annual allowances under section 33A
(i.e.  for  1998/99  and  subsequent  years  of  assessment),  the  actual  capital
expenditure incurred on construction is deemed to have been reduced. In essence,
the  figure  used  is  the  actual  capital  expenditure  reduced  by  the  aggregate  of  the
rebuilding allowances which would have been made under section 36 to the person
in respect of the building in all years of assessment prior to 1998/99 if at all times
during the period of the person’s entitlement to the relevant interest the building
was used for the purposes of producing chargeable profits.

47.
The  balance  of  the  capital  expenditure  thus  arrived  at  (which  will
generally be the capital expenditure incurred on construction less the aggregate of
rebuilding  allowances  previously  granted)  is  used  to  ascertain  the  annual
allowance  made  under  section  33A(1)  (i.e.  4%  of  the  balance).  The  annual
allowance in respect of such transitional cases can be claimed for a period of 25
years,  commencing  with  the  year  of  assessment  1998/99.  This  follows  from
section 33A(4)(b) which provides that for such a building or structure, the year of
assessment  commencing  1  April  1998  shall  be  deemed  to  be  the  year  of
assessment in which the building was first used.

48.
It should be noted that the application of section 33A(4) is not restricted
to  cases  where  a  building  was  a  commercial  building  or  structure  immediately
prior to the commencement of the 1998/99 year of assessment. The provisions of
the subsection also apply to cases where a building was put to some other use (e.g.
as private accommodation unrelated to any trade, profession or business), or was
vacant,  as  at  the  end  of  the  1997/98  year  of  assessment,  and  only  subsequently
came to be used as a commercial building.

Where the Relevant Interest Has Been Sold

Section  33A(2)  provides  that   where  the  relevant  interest  in  a
49.
commercial  building  is  sold,  the  annual  allowance  is  subsequently  calculated  by
reference to the residue of  expenditure  immediately  after the sale (rather than as
4%  of  the  capital  expenditure).  The  subsection  specifies  two  methods  of
ascertaining the proportion of the residue of expenditure immediately after the sale
to be claimed  as an annual allowance.

The  first  method  has  application  where  the  building  was  constructed
50.
prior to the commencement of the year of assessment 1998/99 (i.e. it is a building
to  which  subsection  (4)  applies).  For  such  a  case,  subsection  (2)  prescribes,  in
effect, that the annual allowance is the amount arrived at by dividing the residue of
expenditure  immediately  after  the  sale  by  the  number  of  years  of  assessment
comprised  in  the  period  which  begins  with  the  year  of  assessment  in  which  the
sale occurred, and ends with the year of assessment 2023/24 (i.e. “the 25th year of
assessment after the year of assessment in which this section commences”).

The  second  method  prescribed  in  subsection  (2)  applies  in  any  other
51.
case  (i.e.  where  subsection  (4)  does  not  apply  to  the  building  because  it  was
constructed after the commencement of the year of assessment 1998/99). For such
a case, subsection (2) provides that where the relevant interest is sold, the annual
allowance  is  the  amount  arrived  at  by  dividing  the  residue  of  expenditure
immediately after the sale by the number of years of assessment comprised in the
period  which  begins  with  the  year  of  assessment  in  which  the  sale  occurred  and
ends  with  the  year  of  assessment  which  is  the  25th  year  after  the  year  of
assessment in which the building was first used.

Balancing Allowances and Charges

52.
Reflecting  to  a  large  extent  the  provisions  of  section  35  concerning
industrial  buildings,  section  33B(1)  provides  for  a  balancing  allowance  or
balancing  charge  to  be  made  where  any  of  the  following  events  occurs  to  a
building, while the building is a commercial building -

“    (a)    the relevant interest in the building or structure is sold;

 (b)   the  relevant  interest  in  the  building  or  structure,  being  a
leasehold  interest,  comes  to  an  end  otherwise  than  on  the
is
person  entitled
reversionary thereon; or

thereto  acquiring

interest  which

the

(c)    the building or structure is demolished or destroyed or, without

being demolished or destroyed, ceases altogether to be used. ”

The allowance or charge is made for the year of assessment in the basis period for
which the event occurs.

Balancing Allowances

Section  33B(2)(a)  provides  that  where  the  residue  of  expenditure
53.
immediately before the occurrence of an event referred to in subsection (1)(a) to (c)
exceeds the sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys (if any) arising from
the  event,  a  balancing  allowance  shall  be  made.  If  the  residue  of  expenditure
immediately before the event is nil, a balancing charge is made on the amount of
the sale or other moneys. Where the amount of such moneys exceeds the amount
of the residue, a balancing charge is made in respect of the excess.

54.
It  should  be  noted,  however,  that section  33B(2)(b)  stipulates  that  that
no balancing allowance is to be made where the building in question is demolished
for purposes unconnected with or not in the ordinary course of conduct of the trade,
profession or business of the person in relation to which the building was used to
qualify  for  an  annual  allowance  under  section  33A.  Thus,  for  example,  if  a
commercial  building  were  to  be  demolished  to  enable  land  to  be  sold
unencumbered, no balancing allowance would be made.

Balancing Charges

55.
Where  the  sale,  insurance,  salvage  or  compensation  moneys  arising
from the event exceed the residue of expenditure (if any) immediately before the
occurrence  of  an  event  referred  to  in  subsection  (1)(a)  to  (c),  section  33B(3)(a)
provides that a balancing charge shall be made in respect of the excess. However,
by virtue of section 33B(3)(b) the amount of a balancing charge is limited to the
amount of the annual allowances, if any, made to the person under section 33A.

Termination of a Leasehold Interest

56.
Section  33B(1)(b)  covers  the  normal  case  where  a  leasehold  interest
ends on expiry of a lease. Thus if A agrees to lease a commercial building to B for
a  particular  period,  and  B  becomes  entitled  to  a  relevant  interest  in  relation  to
capital  expenditure  incurred  on  further  construction,  B  will  generally  become
entitled to a balancing allowance where his leasehold interest terminates at the end
of the lease period. This will also be the case if A and B agree to early termination
of the lease, although a balancing charge could arise if compensation is paid by A
to B.

57.
However, a balancing allowance (or charge) will not be made where a
lessee  does  not  vacate  a  commercial  building  at  the  expiration  of  his  leasehold
interest.  Section  33B(1)(b)  excludes  the  case  where  the  person  acquires  the
reversionary interest (e.g. where the lessee purchases the property from the lessor).
Where acquisition does not take place, but the lessee remains in possession of the
building with the consent of the lessor without a new lease being granted, section
35A(a)  provides  that  leasehold  interest  shall  be  deemed  to  continue  (and
accordingly  a  balancing  allowance  cannot  be  granted  under  section  33B(1)(b)).
With the same result, section 35A(b) provides that where a new lease is granted to
the lessee, the second lease is treated as a continuation of the first lease.

A constructed a factory at a cost (excluding the value of the site) of $2,000,000. It
was completed and brought into use in July 1992. The building contract provided
that instalments should be paid monthly and $500,000 was due and paid before 31
March 1992. The balance was paid during the year ended 31 March 1993.

A has carried on a qualifying trade since 1985, and makes up accounts to 31 March
each year.

The factory was sold to B, who had been carrying on a qualifying trade for some
years, on 31 October 1995 for $5 million (including the value of the site).  B makes
up  accounts  to  30  June  each  year.    The  site  value  is  estimated  at  $2.5M.    A
