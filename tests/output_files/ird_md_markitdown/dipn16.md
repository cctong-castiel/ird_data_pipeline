INTRODUCTION

Following  the  enactment  of  the  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)
Ordinance 1991 (“the 1991 Amendment”), it is considered necessary to explain
why  the  Ordinance  has  been  amended  and  lay  down  broad  statements  on  the
practice  to  be  adopted  by  the  Inland  Revenue  Department  in  relation  to  the
taxation  of  fringe  benefits  received  by  employees  and  office  holders.    In  the
latter  regard,  this  Practice  Note  is  concerned  with  fringe  benefits  other  than
in  respect  of
direct  monetary  payments
accommodation and gains from shares and stock.

to  employees  and  benefits

BACKGROUND TO THE 1991 AMENDMENT

2.
The  case  of  David  Hardy  Glynn  v  The  Commissioner  of  Inland
Revenue  3 HKTC 245 had significant implications in relation to the taxation of
fringe benefits and ultimately led to the introduction of the 1991 Amendment
under  consideration.    Before  turning  to  the  significance  of  the  decision,  it  is
relevant to outline the assessing practice followed by the Department in respect
of fringe benefits before the case arose.

Pre-Glynn Assessing Practice

3.
Section  8(1)  of  the  Ordinance  lays  the  charge  to  Salaries  Tax  on
“every person in respect of his income  arising in or derived from Hong Kong”
from  any  office  or  employment  of  profit  and  any  pension.    There  is  no
exhaustive definition of “income from any office or  employment”.    However,
some of the more common kinds of income are enumerated in section 9(1) and
the  word  “perquisite”,  albeit  undefined,  has  been  included  since  the
introduction of the Ordinance.

4.
Prior  to  the  Glynn  case,  it  was  accepted  by  the  Department  and
practitioners  generally  that  principles  derived  from  UK  case  law  determined
whether  perquisites,  or  fringe  benefits,  were  taxable.    The  Department’s
assessing  practice  was  based  on  the  understanding  that  UK  decisions  had
established  that  benefits  received  in  a form  other  than  money,  unless  covered
by  specific  provisions  in  the  Ordinance,  could  only  be  treated  as  chargeable
income if they took the form of “money’s worth”.    A benefit was regarded as

constituting money’s worth if it was capable of being converted into money (by
sale  or  some  other  means)  by  the  recipient  or  involved  the  discharge  of  a
personal  liability  of  the  employee.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  Department
recognized  that  the  employee  was  not  liable  for  the  relevant  expense  and  the
benefit  was  inconvertible,  it  was  generally  accepted  that  the  benefit  was  not
chargeable.

5.
With  regard  to  education  benefits,  however,  the  Department
consistently took the view that any payment made by an employer in respect of
education expenses of an employee’s child represented a chargeable benefit to
the  employee.    This  position  was  based  on  the  understanding  that  it  was  not
possible for an employee as a parent to transfer the liability for the education of
his children to a third party.    Any payment made by the employer was treated
as discharging the employee’s liability and accordingly regarded as “money’s
worth”.

The Glynn Case – the Court of Appeal decision

6.
  In  the  Glynn  case,  school  fees  in  respect  of  Mr.  Glynn’s  daughter
were paid direct to the school by his employer.     The issue, in broad terms, was
whether the payments constituted chargeable income of Mr. Glynn or escaped
chargeability by virtue of the arrangements used to make the payments.

  The  majority  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  held  that  the  payments  in
7.
question  had  been  correctly  treated  by  the Department as being chargeable to
Salaries  Tax.    The  decision  (reported  in   2  HKTC  383 )  was  significant  in  at
least two respects.    Firstly, because all three members of the Court agreed that
it  had  wrongly  been  assumed  that  UK  authorities  were  directly  relevant  and
applicable in Hong Kong and, secondly, because a majority found that the word
“perquisite” in the Ordinance should be given its wide ordinary meaning.    A
strict  application  of  the  decision  would  have  required  the  taxation  of  all
benefits derived by an employee from his employment.

The Administration’s response to the Court of Appeal decision

8.
In view of the implications of the decision, particularly in relation to
the identification and valuation of benefits, the Administration decided that the
Ordinance  should  be  amended  to  accord  with  the  practice  followed  by  the

2

Department before the Glynn case arose.    This decision was announced by the
Department  in  a  public  statement  issued  in  March  1989.    It  was  also
announced that the Department would continue to apply its pre-Glynn practice
pending the introduction of the legislation.    Shortly afterwards, drafting work
commenced on the proposed legislation but finalization was held in abeyance
pending the outcome of Mr.  Glynn’s  appeal to the Privy Council.

Outcome of the Privy Council Appeal

9.
In contrast to the Court of Appeal’s decision, the Privy Council held
that UK authorities on the meaning of expressions in UK tax legislation are of
assistance in construing identical expressions in the Ordinance concerning the
same subject matter.    It was also held that “perquisite” has the same meaning
in the Ordinance as it has in the UK legislation.

10.
The  decision  (reported  in  3  HKTC  245 )  reflected  the  Department’s
pre-Glynn  understanding  of  what  constituted  a  chargeable  perquisite  to  the
extent that it recognized that the term includes:

(a) 	 money which can be obtained from property which is capable

of being converted into money; and

(b) 	 money which is paid in discharge of a debt of the employee.

However,  the  Judicial  Committee  went  further  when  it  held  that  there  is  no
difference between a debt of the taxpayer discharged by an employer pursuant
to the contract of service and money paid for the benefit of an employee by his
employer  pursuant  to  the  contract  of  service.    The  Privy  Council  was  of  the
view that money paid at the request of an employee is equivalent to money paid
to the employee.    In this regard it was stated that an identifiable sum required
to be expended by an employer pursuant to a contract of service for the benefit
of the employee, is money paid at the request of the employee and is taxable as
either part of the employee’s salary or as a monetary perquisite.

11.
The decision did not, however, encompass all benefits derived by an
employee  from  his  employment.    Inconvertible  benefits  not  involving  the
expenditure of money or expenditure not attributable wholly or proportionately
to  one  employee  were  recognized  as  not  being  chargeable1 .  As  an  example,

3

the Privy Council mentioned a nursery school provided by an employer for the
children  of  all  its  employees.    It  also  accepted  that  benefits  resulting  from
expenditure  by  an  employer  for  a  non-contractual  reason  –  for  example  on
compassionate  grounds  –  escaped  chargeability  if  lacking  the  elements  of
expectation  and  continuity.    The  Privy  Council’s  position  concerning  such
benefits reflected the Department’s pre-Glynn practice.

12.
On  the  other  hand,  the  decision  represented  a  departure  from  the
Department’s pre-Glynn practice in that it was not consistent with the view that
an inconvertible benefit escaped chargeability to Salaries Tax if the employer
rather  that  the  employee  was  the  party  liable  for  the  payment  of  the  relevant
expense.

13.
As the Privy Council’s decision in the Glynn case confirmed that not
all employment benefits come within the charge to Salaries Tax, it mitigated to
a certain extent the effects of the Court of Appeals decision.    Nevertheless, the
decision,  and  in  particular  its  effective  rejection  of  the  “liability  test”  as  a
determinant of chargeability, made it clear that the scope of the then legislation
was wider than the Department had understood it to be pre-Glynn.

DETAILS OF THE 1991 AMENDMENT

14.
As  foreshadowed  in  the  announcement  after  the  Court  of  Appeal
decision,  the  Ordinance  was  amended  to  accord  with  the  Department’s
pre-Glynn   assessing  practice  in  respect  of  fringe  benefits.    A  “liability  test”,
contained  in  subparagraph  (iv)  to  section  9(1)(a),  was  introduced  to  exclude
from chargeability any benefit where the relevant payment is one for which the
employer has the sole liability.    The exclusion does not apply to any payment
made by an employer to discharge a liability of an employee and, as previously,
such a payment would normally be chargeable to Salaries Tax as a perquisite.

15.
  The  exclusion  provided  by  section  9(1)(a)(iv)  is  subject  to  section
9(2A)2, which ensures that convertible benefits and education benefits remain
chargeable to Salaries Tax, even if it can be argued that the employer has the
liability for the relevant payment.

4

Two  definitions  were  added  to  section  9(6)3  of  the  Ordinance.    A
16.
definition  of  “child  of  an  employee”,  along  the  lines  used  in  Part  V  of  the
Ordinance, has been inserted for the purposes of the provision concerning the
taxation of education benefits. The second definition is of “employee” and this
has  been  defined  to  include  a  holder  of  an  office.    This  latter  definition  has
been  included  to  make  it  clear  that  the  exclusion  of  benefits  from  chargeable
income  by  section  9(1)(a)(iv)  applies  to  an  employee  and  an  office  holder.
Further, the definition ensures that accommodation benefits provided to office
holders are chargeable to the same extent as those provided to employees.

17.
Section 8(2)(g) of the Ordinance has been amended to confirm that
the  exemption  from  Salaries  Tax  in  respect  of  amounts  arising  from
educational endowments applies only for the benefit of the person receiving the
relevant education.    This is to preclude any argument that an education benefit,
provided by an employer in respect of a child of an employee, is not chargeable
income of the employee by virtue of section 8(2)(g).

TREATMENT OF PARTICULAR BENEFITS

18.
Set out below are details of how the Department views the taxation
position of various categories of non-cash fringe benefits derived by employees
and  office  holders  from  their  employers  or  others.    As  the  particular
arrangements under which fringe benefits are provided can have a bearing on
the taxation consequences, the examples provided are in broad terms only.    It
must  be  stressed  that  whilst  the  Department  recognizes  and  accepts  that
employment  packages  may  legitimately  be  structured  in  a  variety  of  ways,
action  will  be  taken  in  respect  of  blatant  or  contrived  tax  avoidance
In  the  latter  regard,  it  is  relevant  that  section  61A  of  the
arrangements.
Ordinance  provides  that,  in  broad  terms,  where  it  is  concluded  that  a
transaction has been entered into for the sole or dominant purpose of obtaining
a tax benefit, an assessment may be made in a manner appropriate to counter
the  tax  benefit.  Furthermore,  section  61  of  the  Ordinance  provides  for
to  be  disregarded.
artificial  or  fictitious
However,  in  relation  to  the  examples  below  it  has  been  assumed  that  the
benefits  are  provided  under  circumstances  which  would  not  warrant  the
application of the anti-avoidance provisions.

transactions  and  dispositions

5

Liability of Employee discharged by Employer

The  Privy  Council  confirmed  in  the  Glynn  case  that  perquisite
19.
includes  money  which  is  paid  in  discharge  of  a  debt  of  the  employee.    This
position  has  not  been  affected  by  the  1991  Amendment  discussed  above.
Accordingly, where such a payment is made by an employer, the amount of the
payment is regarded by the Department as chargeable income of the employee.

Convertible Benefits

20.
The  Privy  Council  also  confirmed  that  perquisite  includes  money
which can be obtained from property which is capable of being converted into
money.  The  introduction  of  the  “liability  test”  in  section  9(1)(a)(iv)  has  not
affected the position.    Section 9(2A)2 provides that the test shall not operate to
exclude  from  income  “any  benefit  capable  of  being  converted  into  money  by
the recipient”  4 .

21.
Where  a  benefit  takes  the  form  of  an  asset  which  can  be  converted
into  money  by  sale,  the  Department’s  basic  approach  will  be  to  take  as  the
amount  assessable  the  sum  which  the  asset  might  reasonably  be  expected  to
fetch  if  sold  in  the  open  market  at  the  time  of  receipt  of  the  benefit;  i.e.  the
“second-hand” value5 .

Benefits6  which  are  not  convertible  into  money  by  sale  are
22.
sometimes  convertible  by  other  means.    For  example,  an  employee  might  be
provided by his employer with the free use (but not ownership) of a car under
an  arrangement  which  would  allow  the  employee  to  “surrender”  the  car  and
take  additional  wages  instead.    Such  a  benefit  would  be  viewed  by  the
Department  as  being  convertible  into  money  and  accordingly  chargeable  (see
Heaton  v  Bell   46  TC  211).
It  is  not  possible  to  lay  down   hard  and  fast
valuation  rules  to  cover  benefits  which  come  within  this  category.    The
approach taken will depend on the nature of the benefit and the circumstances
under  which  it  is  provided.    In  general  terms,  however,  the  aim  will  be  to
ascertain, as objectively as possible, the amount of money the employee could
obtain  if  he  chose  to  “convert”  the  benefit.    For  the  example  given,  the
Department  would  treat  as  assessable  income  each  year  the  amount  of
additional wages the employee would have received if he had chosen to forego
the benefit.

6

Education Benefits

23.
Amounts “paid by an employer in connection with the education of a
child of an employee” are by virtue of section 9(2A) not subject to the “liability
test”  in  section  9(1)(a)(iv).  Accordingly,  where  such  a  payment  is  made
pursuant  to  the  employee’s  contract  of  employment,  then  irrespective  of
whether  the  employee  or  the  employer  is  the  party  liable  for  the  relevant
expense, the amount paid will be treated as chargeable income of the employee.

24.
The  Department  will  interpret  the  expression  “paid  by  an  employer
in connection with the education of a child” as covering not only payments for
tuition expenses, but also payments  for  incidental  education  expenses  such  as
boarding  fees  and  the  cost  of  school  outings.    Amounts  paid  before  1  April
2003 in respect of passages in connection with education are not chargeable by
virtue of the terms of sections 9(1)(a)(i) and (ii) of the Ordinance.     However,
with  the  repeal  of  sections  9(1)(a)(i)  and  (ii)  by  Revenue  (No.  2)  Ordinance
2003, these payments will be chargeable with effect from 1 April 2003.

25.
In accordance with the decision in an English case, Barclays Bank v
Naylor   39  TC  256,  the  Department  recognizes  that  an  employee  does  not
receive a chargeable benefit where a payment is made in respect of education
expenses of his or her child using income of the child which has been provided
by a genuine discretionary trust funded by the employer.

Car  (or  Boat)  made  available  by  an  Employer  for  the  Private  Use  of  an
Employee

26.
Where  an  employee  is  allowed  to  use  for  private  purposes  a  car
owned  by  his  employer,  the  Department  accepts  that  the  benefit  is  not
chargeable,  provided  that  the  employee  is  not  in  any  way  able  to  convert  the
benefit into money [compare the position outlined at para. 22 above].

27.
If ownership of the car is transferred to the employee, the benefit is
chargeable  to  Salaries  Tax  at  its  convertible  value  at  the  time  of  receipt  [see
para. 21 above].

28.
A  chargeable  benefit  will  also  arise  if  the  employer  discharges  an
expense relating to private use for which the employee is liable. The assessable

7

amount  will  be  the  sum  paid  by  the  employer  to  discharge  the  expense  [see
para. 19 above].

Recreational Facilities/Holiday Homes provides for the Use of Employees

29.
employee is not in any way able to convert the benefit into money.

Such  benefits  are  not  chargeable  to  Salaries  Tax,  provided  that  the

Payment of Utilities by the Employer

30.
Where an employer is the only party liable to pay the cost of utilities
provided  to  an  employee’s  residence,  payments  made  by  the  employer  come
within  the  scope  of  the  new  exclusion  from  income  [section  9(1)(a)(iv)].
Since utilities provided cannot be converted by the employee into money, the
exception to the exclusion in respect of convertible benefits [section 9(2A)(a)]
does not apply.    As a matter of practice, if the account rendered by the utility
company is in the name of the employer only, the Department will accept that
no chargeable benefit arises.

31.
Other benefits supplied in respect of an employee’s residence – such
as furniture and domestic servants – will also not be chargeable to tax if they
are  provided  under  circumstances  where the employer is the only party liable
for  the  relevant  expense  and  the  employee  cannot  convert  the  benefit  into
money.

Loans provided to Employees at less than Market Interest Rates

32.
The  Department  accepts  that  interest-free  and  low  interest  loans
provided by employers to employees are not chargeable benefits where the cost
involved  in  providing  the  benefit  is  the  sole  liability  of  the  employer.    This
acceptance  is  based  on  the  understanding  that  the  benefit  received  by  the
employee  (i.e.  paying  less  that  market  rates)  is  not  of  itself  convertible  into
money.

Credit Cards

Credit  cards  are  sometimes  provided  by  employers  to  employees
33.
under  arrangements  where  expenses  charged  using  the  card  are  billed  to  and

8

paid for the employer.    Where such a card is used for private purposes by an
employee, the Department considers that the benefit obtained is chargeable to
Salaries Tax.    This is because in ordinary usage the holder of the card (i.e. the
employee)  has  a  liability  to  pay  for  the  goods  or  services  received  which  is
effectively discharged by the employer when the card is used.    As discussed in
para.  19  above,  the  amount  of  the  liability  so  discharged  represents  a
chargeable benefit.

Club Benefits

34.
It is accepted that no chargeable benefit arises in respect of the cost
of acquisition of corporate membership of a club.    The Department recognizes
that  as  entitlement  to  corporate  membership  benefits  may  be  transferred  from
one  employee  to  another  it  is  not  possible  to  attribute  such  expenditure  to  a
particular employee.    On the other hand, where an employer makes a payment
in respect of an individual membership fee or other club expense for which an
employee is personally liable, the payment will constitute chargeable income of
the employee.

Holiday Journey Benefits

35.
Prior  to  1  April  2003,  the  value  of  any  holiday  warrant  or  passage
granted by an employer to an employee was exempt from salaries tax, as long
as the benefit had been used for travel.    Similarly, allowance for the purchase
of  holiday  warrant  or  passage  and  allowance  for  the  transportation  of  the
employee’s personal effects in connection with the holiday warrant or passage
were exempt, in so far as they had been used for the purpose.    Following the
enactment  of  Revenue  (No.  2)  Ordinance  2003  which  came  into  effect  on  1
April 2003, the exemption from tax of such benefits has been removed.

In  addition,  section  9(2A)  was  amended  to  the  effect  that  all
36.
payments by an employer in connection with a holiday journey for the benefit
of the employee, irrespective of whether it is convertible into cash and whether
the primary liability for the benefit is the employee’s own, the actual amounts
paid by the employer will be assessable to tax with effect from 1 April 2003.
For  details,  please  refer  to  Departmental  Interpretation  &  Practice  Notes  No.

In contrast, a different approach is adopted by the Department on holiday
journey  benefits  accruing
from  1  April  2003,  see  Departmental
Interpretation & Practice Notes No. 41, para. 18.

2. 	 Section 9(2A) was further amended by Revenue (No. 2) Ordinance 2003 to
provide for the taxation of holiday journey benefits with effect from 1 April
2003.

3. 	 The definition of “holiday journey” was further added by Revenue (No. 2)

Ordinance 2003.

4. 	 The relevant phrase was changed to “any benefit that is capable of being
converted into money by the recipient” by the Revenue (No. 2) Ordinance
2003.

5. 	 This approach is not applicable to holiday journey benefits accruing from
1  April  2003.    For  details,  see  Departmental  Interpretation  &  Practice
Notes No. 41.

6. 	 Holiday journey benefits accruing from 1 April 2003 are excluded.    For
taxation  of  holiday  journey  benefits,  see  Departmental  Interpretation  &
Practice Notes No. 41.
