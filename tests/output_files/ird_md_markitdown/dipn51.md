INTRODUCTION

Relevant legislation

The Revenue (Profits Tax Exemption for Offshore Funds) Ordinance
2006 was enacted to provide profits tax exemption to offshore funds while the
Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  (No.  2)  Ordinance  2015  (the  2015  Ordinance)
was enacted to extend the profits tax exemption for offshore funds to offshore
private  equity  funds.    This  Note  sets  out  the  Department’s  interpretation  and
practice in relation to the relevant provisions under the 2015 Ordinance which
are  mainly  applicable  to  offshore  private  equity  funds.  Reference  should  also
be  made  to  Departmental  Interpretation  and  Practice  Notes  No.  43  (Revised)
(Profits  Tax  Exemption  for  Offshore  Funds)  (DIPN  43)  since  it  covers  the
interpretation  and  practice  relating  to  the  offshore  fund  regime  as  a  whole.
Unless specified otherwise, all the provisions quoted herein refer to the Inland
Revenue Ordinance (the Ordinance).

PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS

Nature of private equity funds

Private equity funds are almost always closed ended vehicles.    They
2.
provide finance in return for an equity stake in potentially high growth private
companies.    They are privately marketed and funded by capital raised outside
the  public  markets.    Private  equity  funds  are  pooled  investment  vehicles,
usually structured with a finite investment period.    Sources of capital include
pension  funds,  sovereign  wealth  funds,  funds  of  funds,  insurance  companies
etc.

Fund lifecycle

3.
Private equity funds typically invest in private companies for around
5  to  7  years.    This  means  a  commitment  to  building  sustainable  and  lasting
value in the business they invest in.    The way to realize returns is to sell the
business  in  better  shape  than  when  it  was  acquired.    Typically  private  equity
funds will sell their stake in a private company by listing on the public markets
or selling to a strategic buyer.

Private equity funds typically look to invest directly or indirectly, via
4.
a  special  purpose  vehicle  (SPV),  majority  stakes  in  private  companies  by
purchase of shares from the existing shareholders or through the subscription of
new  shares.    Growth  in  the  business  is  delivered  by  working  with  the
management  team  of  the  private  company  to  improve  performance  and
strategic direction, making complimentary investments and driving operational
improvements.    In the exit strategy, there will be criteria for what needs to be
achieved before resale and there will be periodic reviews of strategy.

Fund structure

Limited partnership is the most common private equity fund vehicle.
5.
Complex  and  multi-vehicle  fund  structures,  including  parallel  funds  and
master-feeder structures, may be used in order to accommodate the preferences
of  fund  investors.    A  typical  limited  partnership  structure  is  depicted  in  the
Appendix.

BEFORE THE 2015 ORDINANCE

Specified transactions and specified person

6.
Before  the  enactment  of  the  2015  Ordinance,  non-resident  persons,
including  individuals,  partnerships,  trustees  of  trust  estates  or  corporations,
were  exempt  from  tax  in  respect  of  profits  derived  from  “specified
transactions” carried out through or arranged by a “specified person” and from
“transactions  incidental  to  the  carrying  out  of  specified  transactions”.    The
non-resident  person  could  not  carry  on  any  trade,  profession  or  business  in
Hong Kong other than the specified transactions as defined in Schedule 16 to
the  Ordinance  and  transactions  incidental  to  the  carrying  out  of  the  specified
transactions.

7.
“Specified  transactions”  were  broadly  defined  in  Schedule  16  to
cover  typical  transactions  carried  out  by  offshore  funds  in  Hong  Kong.
Schedule 16 contained six categories of specified transactions: a transaction in
securities; a transaction  in  futures contracts; a transaction  in  foreign  exchange
contracts; a transaction consisting in making a deposit other than by way of a
money-lending business;  a  transaction  in  foreign  currencies;  and  a  transaction
in exchange-traded  commodities.  “Specified  persons”  as  defined  in  section

2

20AC(6)  included  corporations  licensed  and  authorized  financial  institutions
registered  under the Securities and Futures  Ordinance  (Cap.  571)  for carrying
on  a  business  in  any  regulated  activity  as  defined  by  Part  1  of  Schedule  5  to
that Ordinance.

Securities of private companies excluded

8.
The  definition  of  “securities”  in  Schedule  16  did  not  include
securities of a private company.    In other words, offshore private equity funds
that  made  use  of  the  service  of  a  “specified  person”  to  derive  profits  from
transaction  in  securities  of  private  companies  could  be  subject  to  profits  tax.
Nevertheless,  private  equity  business  might  not  necessarily  be  managed  by
corporations  licensed  or  authorized  financial  institutions  registered  under  the
Securities and Futures Ordinance.

9.
Offshore  private  equity  funds  might  use  asset  management  and
ancillary  professional  services,  such  as  services  for  launching,  fund-raising,
closing,  structuring,  documentation,  investing,  ongoing  managing,  divestment
and  distribution,  in  Hong  Kong.    This  could  thus  render  the  profits  derived
from transactions in securities of private companies outside Hong Kong subject
to profits tax in Hong Kong.

THE 2015 ORDINANCE

Aim of amendment ordinance

10.
The  2015  Ordinance  was  passed  in  July  2015  to  extend  the  profits
tax  exemption  for  offshore  funds  to  offshore  private  equity  funds.    By
providing  clear  profits  tax  exemption  to  transactions  conducted  by  offshore
private  equity  funds  in  respect  of  eligible  overseas  private  companies,  more
private  equity  fund  managers  are  expected  to  expand  their  business  in  Hong
Kong and more offshore private equity fund managers are attracted to set up or
expand their business in Hong Kong, thereby generating demand for local asset
management,  investment  and  advisory  services,  as  well  as  other  relevant
professional services.

11.

The main provisions of the 2015 Ordinance are as follows:

(a)

Section 20AC is amended to -

(i)

exempt a non-resident person that is a qualifying fund
from profits tax in respect of assessable profits of the
person  arising  from  specified
transactions  and
transactions incidental to the carrying out of specified
transactions;

(ii)

provide that section 20AC does not apply to an SPV;
and

(iii)  provide  for  the  application  of  the  amended  section
20AC  to  such  transactions  carried  out  within  the
period from 1 April 2015 to 16 July 2015 (i.e. the day
before  that  date  of  commencement  of  the  2015
Ordinance).

Section 20ACA is added to exempt an SPV, which may be a
resident  person  or  a  non-resident  person,  from  the  payment
of  tax  in  respect  of  its  assessable  profits  arising  from
transactions  concerning  an  interposed  SPV,  or  an  excepted
private company, as defined by that section.

is  added

to  provide

in  certain
Section  20AF
circumstances,  the  assessable  profits  of  an  SPV,  held  by  a
non-resident  person  and  exempt  from  the  payment  of  tax
under  the  new  section  20ACA,  are  to  be  regarded  as  the
assessable profits of a resident person.

that

Definition of “securities” in section 1 of Part 2 of Schedule
16  is  amended  to  include  interests  such  as  shares  and
debentures  of,  or  issued  by,  SPVs  or  excepted  private
companies.

EXEMPTION EXTENDED TO PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS

Expanded definition of securities

12.
The  2015  Ordinance  has  amended  the  definition  of  “securities”  in
Schedule 16 to the Ordinance so that a transaction in securities of an SPV or an
excepted  private  company  is  a  “specified  transaction”.      Currently,  the  term
“securities” means:

(a)

subject  to  section  21(6)  of  Schedule  17A  (specified
alternative bond scheme and its tax treatment), shares, stocks,
debentures,  loan  stocks,  funds,  bonds  or  notes  of,  or  issued
by,  a  body,  whether  incorporated  or  unincorporated,  or  a
government  or  municipal  government  authority  (excluding
shares, stocks, debentures, loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes
of, or issued by, a private company which is  not an SPV or
an excepted private company);

(b)

rights,  options  or  interests  (whether  described  as  units  or
otherwise)
in,  or  in  respect  of,  such  shares,  stocks,
debentures, loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes;

(c)         certificates  of  interest  or  participation  in,  temporary  or
interim certificates for, receipts for, or warrants to subscribe
for or purchase, such shares, stocks, debentures, loan stocks,
funds, bonds or notes;

(d)

    interests in any collective investment scheme;

(e)

interests,  rights  or  property,  whether  in  the  form  of  an
instrument or otherwise, commonly known as securities.

13.
This  definition  of  “securities”  applies  to  specified  transactions
carried out from 1 April 2015 onwards.    The new scope of “securities” should
be  able  to  cover  most  of  the  relevant  instruments,  such  as  debentures,  loan
stocks,  funds,  bonds  or  notes  issued  by  SPVs  or  excepted  private  companies,
including  hybrid  instruments  which  are  used  to  structure  private  equity
investments.

5

Special purpose vehicle

Private  equity  funds  generally  set  up  one  tier  or  multiple  tiers  of
14.
SPVs to hold their private companies.    This facilitates the subsequent disposal
of  such  companies  by  way  of  transferring  the  ownership  interests  in  SPVs.
With  the  new  definition  of  “securities”  in  section  1  of  Part  2  of  Schedule  16,
offshore private equity funds are exempt from tax in respect of profits derived
from  a  transaction  in:  shares,  stocks,  debentures,  loan  stocks,  funds,  bonds  or
notes of, or issued by an SPV; rights, options, or interests (whether described as
units  or  otherwise)  in  an  SPV;  or  certificates  of  interest  or  participation  in  or
warrants  to  subscribe  for  or  purchase  an  SPV.    The  transaction  refers  to  the
disposal of securities of an SPV.    To qualify for tax exemption, an SPV must
be a corporation, partnership, trustee of a trust estate or any other entity that:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

is wholly or partially owned by a non-resident person (i.e. an
offshore fund);

is  established  solely  for  the  purpose  of  holding,  directly  or
indirectly,  and  administering  one  or  more  excepted  private
companies;

is  incorporated,  registered  or  appointed  in  or  outside  Hong
Kong;

does  not  carry  on  any  trade  or  activities  except  for  the
purpose of holding, directly or indirectly, and administering
one or more excepted private companies; and

(e)

is not itself an excepted private company.

The  definition  in  section  20ACA  explicitly  excludes  an  SPV  which
15.
has  been  engaged  in  any  trade  or  activities  apart  from  holding,  directly  or
indirectly, and administering one or more excepted private companies.

Example 1

In  January  2008,  Company  HK  was  incorporated  as  a  private
company  to  hold  properties  in  Hong  Kong.    Fund  F1,  resident  in

6

Jurisdiction F1, held all the shares in Company HK.    In December
2010,  Company  HK  became  dormant  after  the  disposal  of  its
properties.    In January 2011, Fund F1 made use of Company HK to
acquire  Company  F2,  an  excepted  private  company  incorporated
and resident in Jurisdiction F2.    In October 2015, Fund F1 sold its
shares in Company HK and made a profit.

Fund  F1  was  not  entitled  to  tax  exemption  provided  under  section
20AC  in  respect  of  profits  derived  from  the  sale  of  shares  in
Company  HK.    Company  HK  did  not  qualify  as  an  SPV  under
section 20ACA since it was not established solely for the purpose of
holding and administering Company F2.    If the profit from the sale
of  shares  in  Company  HK  was  a  trading  profit  derived  from
operations  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong,  it  would  be  subject  to  profits
tax.

Excepted private company

16.
An offshore private  equity fund deriving  profits from transaction  in
securities of an excepted private company can enjoy tax exemption.    The term
“excepted  private  company”  refers  to  a  “private  company”,  incorporated
outside  Hong  Kong,  which  at  all  times  within  the  three  years  before  a
transaction in securities of the SPV or private company:

(a)

did not carry on any business through or from a permanent
establishment in Hong Kong;

(b)

falls within either of the following descriptions -

(i)

it  did  not  hold  (whether  directly  or  indirectly)  share
capital  (however  described)  in  one  or  more  private
companies carrying on any business through or from
a permanent establishment in Hong Kong;

(ii)

it held  such share capital, but  the aggregate  value of
the  holding  of  the  capital  is  equivalent  to  not  more
than 10% of the value of its own assets; and

7

(c)

falls within either of the following descriptions -

(i)

(ii)

it  neither  held  immovable  property  in  Hong  Kong,
nor held (whether directly or indirectly) share capital
in  one  or  more  private
(however  described)
indirect  holding  of
companies  with  direct  or
immovable property in Hong Kong;

it  held  such  immovable  property  or  share  capital  (or
both),  but  the  aggregate  value  of  the  holding  of  the
property  and  capital  is  equivalent  to  not  more  than
10% of the value of its own assets.

Profits  derived  from  disposal  of  private  companies  not  fulfilling  the  above
conditions will not be subject to profits tax if they are capital in nature or are
derived from operations outside Hong Kong.

Definition of private company

Since  the  definition  of  “private  company”  in  section  11  of  the
17.
Companies  Ordinance  (Cap.  622) 1   may  not  be  applicable  to  companies
incorporated  outside  Hong  Kong,  the  term  has  to  be  specifically  defined.    In
section 20ACA, “private company” is defined to mean a company incorporated
in or outside Hong Kong that is not allowed to issue any invitation to the public
to subscribe for any shares or debentures of the company.

18.
In deciding whether a company is not allowed to issue invitations to
the  public  to  subscribe  for  its  shares  or  debentures,  all  circumstances  will  be
examined.    If  the  company  is  incorporated  in  Hong  Kong,  the  relevant
provisions  in  the  Companies  Ordinance  will  be  applied  to  determine  whether
the  company  is  a  private  company  (i.e.  whether  it  can  issue  invitation  to  the
public  for  capital).    If  the  company  is  incorporated  outside  Hong  Kong,
provisions  in  overseas  legislation,  including  but  not  limiting  to  overseas
company  legislation,  will  be  applied  to  determine  whether  the  company  is

1    Under section 11 of the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622), “private company” means a company which by its
articles  -  (a)  restricts  the  right  to  transfer  its  shares;  and  (b)  limits  the  number  of  its  members  to  50,  not
including persons who are in the employment of the company and persons who, having been formerly in the
employment  of  the  company,  were  while  in  that  employment,  and have  continued  after  the determination  of
that employment to be, members of the company; and (c) prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for
any shares or debentures of the company.

8

allowed to issue invitations to the public for capital.    If taking additional steps
or seeking approval would allow the company to issue invitations to the public
but without involving a substantial change to its nature, the company is treated
as not prohibited from issuing shares or debentures to the public.    In general,
neither  a  listed  company  nor  a  non-private  unlisted  company  (i.e.  a  public
company  with  more  than  50  members)  would  be  treated  as  a  “private
company”.

Three-year time frame

19.
The offshore private equity fund will only qualify for tax exemption
if  the  excepted  private  company  meets  all  the  conditions  listed  in  paragraph
16(a)  to  (c)  above  at  all  times  within  the  three  years  before  the  transaction  in
securities in that company is carried out.    The transaction refers to a disposal
of  securities  of  or  issued  by  the  excepted  private  company.    The  three  year
period counts backward from the date of such a disposal.    The three-year time
requirement equally applies to the disposal by an SPV of such securities.

Example 2

On 1 October 2010, Limited Partnership F1 resident in Jurisdiction
F1  acquired  all  the  share  capital  in  Company  F2.    Company  F2
was  incorporated  as  a  private  company  in  Jurisdiction  F2  and  it
closed its accounts on 31 December every year.    Company F2 was a
holding company, not an SPV, and all the companies it held only had
business  operations  or  properties  in  territories  outside  Hong  Kong.
Since 1 October 2010, Company F2 had not carried on any business
in Hong Kong nor held any immovable property in Hong Kong.    On
1  July  2015,  Limited  Partnership  F1  carried  out  the  transaction  in
Hong Kong to sell all the shares in Company F2 and made a profit.

Profits derived by Limited Partnership F1 from the sale of shares in
Company  F2  were  exempt  from  profits  tax  though  the  sale
transaction  was  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong.    Company  F2  qualified
as  an  excepted  private  company  since  Company  F2  and  the
companies  it  held  did  not  carry  on  any  business  or  hold  any
properties in Hong Kong at all times within the three years before the
sale of shares (i.e. from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2015).

9

Safe harbour rules

The excepted private company cannot carry on a business through or
20.
from  a  permanent  establishment  in  Hong  Kong.    However,  it  is  allowed  to
have  some  insignificant  business  activities  in  Hong  Kong  but  the  business
activities must be of a purely preparatory or auxiliary character and the place of
business does not constitute a permanent establishment.

The excepted private company may also hold share capital (however
21.
described),  subject  to  the  10%  safe  harbour  rule,  in  one  or  more  private
companies  carrying  on  any  business
through  or  from  a  permanent
establishment  in  Hong  Kong.    The  term  “share  capital  (however  described)”
covers  all  forms  of  participation  interests  or  equity  interests  which  entitle  the
holders to participate in or share profits accrued to a private company, with or
without a share capital.

In  general,  the  derivation  of  rental  income  from  the  business
22.
activities  of  letting  or  sub-letting  of  immovable  properties  in  Hong  Kong,
whether by the excepted private company or a private company it holds will be
regarded  as  the  carrying  on  of  a  business  through  or  from  a  permanent
establishment in Hong Kong.

The  aggregate  value  of  participation  interests  or  equity  interests  in
23.
private  companies with  a  permanent  establishment  in  Hong  Kong,  held  by  an
excepted private company, cannot exceed 10% of the value of the assets of the
excepted  private  company.    The  “value  of  the  holding  of  the  capital”  in
paragraph  16(b)(ii)  and  (c)(ii)  refers  to  the  “market  value”  and  not  the  “par
value” or “nominal value” of the capital.    In calculating the value of the total
assets  of  a  company,  debts  of  the  company  including  liabilities  secured  by
mortgages  on  the  relevant  immovable  property  are  not  deducted.    Thus  the
values used in the percentage calculation are in gross amount.

24.
The  excepted  private  company  is  not  expected  to  hold  any
immovable  property  of  significant  value  in  Hong  Kong.    This  is  to  prevent
local entities from converting  trading profits  derived from investments in real
estate  into  non-taxable  income  via  an  offshore  private  equity  fund  structure.
It is stipulated that the aggregate value of the immovable property held in Hong
Kong  by  the  excepted  private  company  and  the  “share  capital  (however

10

described)” held in other private companies, with direct or indirect holding of
property in Hong Kong, cannot exceed 10% of the value of the total assets of
the excepted private company.

25.
When  applying  the  10%  safe  harbour  rules,  it  is  necessary  to
examine  the  audited  financial  statements  of  the  excepted  private  company  for
the latest three years, supplemented by management accounts up to the date of
transaction in securities, to determine:

(a)         the market value of the holding of share capital in the private
company carrying on business through or from a permanent
establishment in Hong Kong;

(b)         the  market  value  of  the  holding  of  immovable  property  in

Hong Kong;

(c)         the market value of the holding of share capital in the private
company  with  direct  or  indirect  holding  of  immovable
property in Hong Kong; and

(d)         the  market  value  of  the  assets  of  the  excepted  private

company.

26.
The  safe  harbour  rules  are  meant  to  be  straight  forward  in  their
application  without  imposing  too  much  of  a  burden  on  an  offshore  private
equity fund, in particular if the excepted private company has an insignificant
amount of share capital in a private company which has immovable properties
in Hong Kong.    Generally, it may not be necessary to obtain a valuation of the
underlying immovable properties since the offshore private equity  fund might
not be able to request for a valuation of the immovable properties.

27.
The value of the holding of share capital in a private company, which
is  held  directly  or  indirectly  by  the  excepted  private  company,  having  a
permanent  establishment  in  Hong  Kong  or  with  direct  or  indirect  holding  of
immovable  property  in  Hong  Kong,  is  not  affected  by  the  number  of  private
companies  interposed  in  between.    Therefore,  the  question  of  double  or
multiple  counting  the  value  of  the  share  capital  in  another  private  company
interposed in between should not arise.

Example 3

On 1 January 2010, Limited Partnership F1 resident in Jurisdiction
F1  acquired  50%  of  the  share  capital  in  Company  F2.    Company
F2 was incorporated as a private company in Jurisdiction F2 and it
closed  its  accounts  on  31  December  every  year.    At  all  relevant
times,  Company  F2  held  60%  of  the  share  capital  in  Company  HK
which was carrying on a trade in Hong Kong.    On 1 October 2015,
Limited Partnership F1 sold all the shares in Company F2 and made
a  profit.    The  financial  statements  of  Company  F2  gave  the
following details:

As at

Market Value of Total
Assets of Company F2  Company HK Held by Company F2

Since it might not be practical for Limited Partnership F1 to provide
data for the exact period from 1 October 2012 to 30 September 2015,
the  available  financial  statements  could  be  relied  upon  to  perform
below calculations:

As at

31.12.2011

31.12.2012

31.12.2013

31.12.2014

Market Value of Shares in Company HK Divided by
Market Value of Total Assets of Company F2

$90m ÷ $1,400m = 6.4%

$100m ÷ $1,500m = 6.7%

$120m ÷ $1,200m = 10%

$115m ÷ $1,250m = 9.2%

It is necessary to examine the management accounts prepared up to
30 September 2015.    If it is satisfied that the market value of shares

than 10% of the market value of the total assets of Company F2 at all
times  within  the  three  years  (i.e.  from  1  October  2012  to  30
September  2015)  before  the  sale  of  the  shares  in  Company  F2,  the
profit derived by Limited Partnership F1 from the sale of the shares
in Company F2 would be exempt under section 20AC.

Therefore, the profit derived by Limited Partnership F1 from the sale
of  the  shares  in  Company  F2  would  not  be  exempt  under  section
20AC.    For the purpose of calculation, the values of the holding of
share  capital  in  Company  HK3  and  Company  HK4  (having
immovable  properties  in  Hong  Kong),  indirectly  held  by  Company
F2 via Company HK2, do not need to be taken into account.

Permanent establishment of private company

28.
For  a  private  company,  a  permanent  establishment  is  defined  in
section 20ACB(1) to mean a fixed place of business through which activities of
the company are wholly or partly carried on, including a branch and a place of
management.    From the definition, it is clear that other places of business may
be  regarded  as  a  permanent  establishment  in  accordance  with  the  meaning
generally adopted in taxation for permanent establishments.    The term “place
of management” used in the definition usually refers to a place of work or an
office  where  some  of  the  supervisory  activities  for  a  private  company  is
exercised.    While  an  office,  a  factory  and  a  workshop  are  normally  a  fixed
place  of  business,  they  may  not  necessarily  be  a  place  where  the  business  or
trade is being managed.

29.
It is expressly stated in section 20ACB(2) that if a private company
has  an  agent  carrying  on  activities  in  Hong  Kong,  who  has,  and  habitually
exercises, a general authority to negotiate and conclude contracts on behalf of
the  private  company  or  has  a  stock  of  merchandise  from  which  the  agent
regularly fills orders on behalf of the company, the company will be deemed to
have  a  permanent  establishment  in  Hong  Kong.    The  agent  may  not  be  the
final  signatory  to  a  contract  but  if  it  participates  in  the  negotiations  and
formulates  the  contract  provisions  on  behalf  of  the  private  company  then  the
private company will still be regarded as having a permanent establishment in
Hong Kong.

30.
In defining a permanent establishment, section 20ACB(3) excludes a
place  of  business  whose  activities,  for  the  private  company,  are  purely  of  a
preparatory or auxiliary character.    The following activities of a preparatory or
auxiliary  character  may  be  carried  out  for  the  private  company  without
constituting a permanent establishment:

15

(a)

the use of facilities solely for storage, display or delivery of
goods or merchandise belonging to the company;

(b)

(c)

the  maintenance  of  a  stock  of  goods  or  merchandise
belonging  to  the  company  solely  for  storage,  display  or
delivery, or for processing by another business; and

the  maintenance  of  a  fixed  place  of  business  solely  for
for  collecting
purchasing  goods  or  merchandise,  or
information, for the company.

The  term  “activities”  used  in  section  20ACB  is  generic  and  covers
31.
both  “business  activities”  and  “trading  activities”,  though  the  activities
themselves  may  not  constitute  the  “business”  or  “trade”  itself.    In  general,
conduct  having  the  character  or  essence  of  a  business  or  trade  would  involve
capital, dealings with other persons, plant and machinery, etc.

32.
The  formulations  in  section  20ACB(2)(a)  and  (b)  should  be  wide
enough  to  cover  factors  (i.e.  mercantile  agents)  and  consignees.    Section
20ACB(3)(a) and (b) however excludes delivery activities not involving a stock
of  merchandise  from  which  an  agent  regularly  fills  orders  for  the  company.
The  formulation  of  section  20ACB(2)(b)  caters  for  the  situation  where  the
company has an “agent” carrying on activities in Hong Kong who has a “stock
of merchandise” from which the agent “regularly fills orders” on behalf of the
company.      The keeping of a stock of merchandise, the presence of an agent
and the filling of orders here are the crux of the issue.    They imply that active
business transactions are involved with the profit derived therefrom subject to
taxation.    As for section 20ACB(3)(a), the mere “storage, display or delivery”
services  assume  only  a  passive  role  and  therefore  it  should  be  excluded  from
the business of the company as mentioned in section 20ACB(1) and (2).

16

FUNDS NOT ENGAGING A SPECIFIED PERSON

Qualifying fund

33.
Section 20AC has been amended to provide for an additional avenue
for bona fide private equity funds, which are not managed by persons licensed
by or registered with the Securities and Future Commission, to be eligible for
tax  exemption.    An  offshore  private  equity  fund  carrying  out  a  “specified
transaction” would be eligible for tax exemption in respect of profits from that
transaction if either of the following conditions is satisfied -

(a)         the  specified  transaction  has  been  carried  out  through  or

arranged by a specified person;

(b)         the  offshore  private  equity  fund  conducting  the  specified

transaction is a “qualifying fund”.

34.
exemption, the following conditions must be met:

In  order  to  be  a  “qualifying  fund”  and  hence  be  eligible  for  tax

(a)         at all times after the final closing of sale of interests -

(i)

the number of investors exceeds 4; and

(ii)

the  capital  commitments  made  by  investors  exceed
90% of the aggregate capital commitments; and

(b)         the portion of the net proceeds arising out of the transactions
of  the  fund  to  be  received  by  the  originator  and  the
the  portion
originator’s
is
(which
attributable
proportionate  to  that  attributable  to  the  investors’  capital
contributions),  is  agreed  under  an  agreement  governing  the
operation of the fund to be an amount not exceeding 30% of
the net proceeds.

Section  20AC(6)  contains  definitions  of  “aggregate  capital
35.
commitment”,  “associate”,  “capital  commitment”,  “final  closing  of  sale  of

17

interests”,  “investor”,  “net  proceeds”  and  “originator”  in  relation  to  the
meaning of “qualifying fund”.

36.
For  the  purposes  of  a  qualifying  fund,  the  “investor”  is  defined  to
mean  a  person,  other  than  the  originator  or  the  originator’s  associates,  who
makes capital commitment to the fund.    The “originator” means a person who
directly  or  indirectly  originates  or  sponsors  the  fund;  and  has  the  power  to
make investment decisions on behalf of the fund.    In the context of a limited
partnership structure, generally the “investors” are the limited partners and the
“originator” is the general partner.

The term of “capital commitment” means a commitment that is in the
37.
form  of  an  amount  of  money  payable  by  an  investor,  the  originator  or  the
originator’s associate to the fund under  an agreement governing the operation
of the fund; and in respect of which the originator may make capital calls from
time to time according to the terms of the agreement.    The “aggregate capital
commitment” is the total of the capital commitments made by the investors, the
originator and the originator’s associates.

In relation to a qualifying fund, “final closing of sale of interests” is
38.
defined  to  mean  the  date  on  which  the  originator  last  accepts  subscriptions
from investors for  making capital commitments.    The time of “final closing”
should  be  clear  from  the  fund  document  or  prospectus  which  form  part  of  a
contract  agreed  at  the  outset.  Since  private  equity  funds  are  generally  closed
ended  vehicles,  the  Commissioner  would  not  accept  that  an  originator  can
continually  vary  the  closing  date  by  inviting  new  subscribers  into  the  fund,
thereby moving the reference point of time.

39.
Provisions  on  “associate”  are  required  to  prevent  the  private  equity
fund  from  being  controlled  by  the  originator  and  its  associates.    Section
20AC(6)  contains  the  definition  of  “associate”  and  the  related  definitions  of
“associated  corporation”,  “associated  partnership”,  “control”,  “principal
officer” and “relative”.

Number of investors

There  must  be  at  least  5  investors,  who  have  made  capital
40.
commitment  in  the  private  equity  fund,  at  any  time  after  the  final  closing  of

18

sale  of  interests.    In  a  multi-layer  ownership  structure  with  a  series  of
intermediaries  or  a  fund  of  funds  structure,  it  is  essential  to  correctly  identify
the  offshore  private  equity  fund  for  the  purposes  of  section  20AC  before
counting the number of investors.

Example 6

Limited  Partnership  F,  being  the  main  Fund,  was  a  non-resident
private  equity  fund  with  two  parallel  funds.    The  Fund  Agreement
of  each  parallel  fund  was  substantially  the  same  as  the  Fund
Agreement  for  the  main  Fund,  subject  to  modifications  for
regulatory, tax, structuring or other reasons.    The size of the main
Fund  and  the  parallel  funds  were  aggregated  for  purposes  of  any
overall  Fund  size  cap,  and  investors  in  the  Fund  and  the  parallel
funds  generally  were  aggregated  for  purposes  of  voting  under  the
Fund Agreements.

The  totality  of  facts,  including  the  constitutive  documents,  the
investment  mandate  and  the  management  agreements,  would  be
examined  to  decide  whether  the  two  parallel  funds  constitute  two
different persons for the purposes of sections 20AB and 20AC.    If
the two parallel funds constitute two different persons, each parallel
fund  will  be  counted  as  one  investor.    With  the  facts  given  in  the
example,  the  main  Fund  and  the  parallel  funds  should  be  looked
upon as a single fund.

Example 7

formed  two  feeder

Limited  Partnership  F1  was  a  private  equity  fund  resident  in
Jurisdiction  F1  with  a  master-feeder  structure.    In  this  case,  the
funds  that  would  aggregate  the
sponsor
commitments  of  certain
from  Jurisdiction  F2  and
Jurisdiction  F3.    One  feeder  fund  was  structured  as  a  blocker
vehicle  and  was  taxed  as  a  corporation  for  income  tax  purposes  in
Jurisdiction  F2.    This  feeder  fund  would  then  invest  directly  in
Limited Partnership F1 as a Limited Partner.

investors

19

Feeder  funds  are  often  vehicles  to  account  for  the  needs  of  the
investors and they may not have independent existence on their own.
To  determine  whether  it  is  appropriate  to  see  through  the  feeder
vehicle  when  counting  the  number  of  investors,  the  totality  of  facts
including the constitutive documents would be examined.    Since the
two feeder funds were set up purely to address the needs of investors
from  different  jurisdictions  for  investment  into  Limited  Partnership
F1  only,  it  would  not  be  inappropriate  to  see  through  the  feeders
when counting the number of investors.

Example 8

Limited  Partnership  F1  was  a  non-resident  private  equity  fund,
centrally managed and controlled in Jurisdiction F1.    It was seeded
by National Pension Plan F2 of Jurisdiction F2.    National Pension
Plan  F2  funded  retirement  pensions,  disability  pension,  death
benefits,  survivor’s  pension  and  other  pension/benefit  for  some  18
million contributors and beneficiaries in Jurisdiction F2.

In general, a pension fund of such a scale is regulated by legislation
and is likely to operate with great independence.    The  participants
and  beneficiaries  of  the  pension  fund  would  have  no  direct  or
indirect  control  or  influence  over  the  management  of  investments
made  by  the  pension  fund.    For  the  purposes  of  determining
whether  Limited  Partnership  F1  is  a  qualifying  fund,  National
Pension Plan F2 would be counted as one investor.

Capital commitment

41.
The 90% capital commitment condition in defining a qualifying fund
means that the originator may make calls from time to time for payment of the
capital,  which  has  not  been  paid  or  satisfied  by  an  investor,  under  a  capital
commitment  according  to  the  terms  of  agreement  governing  the  operation  of
the  fund.    The  aim  is  to  ensure  that  the  private  equity  fund  is  not  simply  a
vehicle  of  one  single  investor.    The  term  “capital  calls”  is  not  defined  in  the
Ordinance.    It carries the literal meaning (i.e. calls or requests for capital) and
such  calls  are  invariably  governed  by  the  contractual  terms  laid  down  in  an
agreement governing the operation of the fund.

20

Net proceeds

42.
at a particular time, to mean an amount calculated by:

Section 20AC(6) defines the term “net proceeds” in relation to a fund

(a)

adding together -

(i)

the  sum  of  the  cumulative  distributions  received  by
the  investors,  the  originator  and  the  originator’s
associates from the fund; and

(ii)

the value at that time of all assets, if any, held by the
fund; and

(b)

subtracting from the sum calculated under sub-paragraph (a)
the  cumulative  capital  contributions  of  the  investors,  the
originator and the originator’s associates.

43.
The 30% threshold of the net proceeds aims to deny tax exemption to
funds the profits of which are simply siphoned to one single investor who may
be  the  fund  manager.    The  condition  ensures  that  the  vehicle  is  a  bona  fide
private  equity  fund.    That  is,  the  private  equity  fund  is  not  simply  a  vehicle
majority  owned  by  the  fund  manager  with  other  investors  holding  nominal
interest.

It is not uncommon in the private equity business to reward the fund
44.
manager  a  performance  fee  or  carried  interest  which  is  around  20%  of  the
fund’s  profits  above  a  hurdle  rate.    The  30%  threshold  is  higher  than  the
industry  benchmark  of  20%.    In  considering  whether  the  30%  threshold  has
been observed, it is necessary to refer to various documents, such as the limited
partnership  agreement,  so  as  to  ascertain  the  performance  fee,  performance
linked reward, carried interest or profit-related return (however described).    It
is  also  expected  that  fund  constitutive  documents,  such  as  private  placement
memorandum and the management agreement, would be made available to the
Assessor to prove that the fund is established as a bona fide private equity fund.

21

Distributions  are  always  made  by  the  fund  manager  after  making
45.
provisions for all known liabilities as required by the distribution provisions in
the agreement  governing the operation of the fund.    Therefore, it is expected
that the distributions under paragraph 42(a)(i) above have been arrived in such
manner.

SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLE

Exempt from tax payment

Section  20ACA(1)  exempts  an  SPV,  to  the  extent  corresponding  to
46.
the  percentage  of  shares  or  interests  held  by  the  offshore  private  equity  fund,
which  is  exempt  under  section  20AC(1),  from  payment  of  tax  in  respect  of
assessable  profits  arising  from  the  following  transactions  carried  out  for  any
year of assessment commencing on or after 1 April 2015:

(a)         transactions in shares, stocks, debentures, loan stocks, funds,
bonds or notes of, or issued by, an interposed special purpose
vehicle or an excepted private company;

(b)         transactions in rights, options or interests (whether described
as units or otherwise) in, or in respect of, such shares, stocks,
debentures, loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes; and

(c)

transactions  in  certificates  of  interest  or  participation  in,
temporary or interim certificates for, receipts for, or warrants
to subscribe for or purchase, such shares, stocks, debentures,
loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes.

The  SPV  is  a  purpose-built  structuring  tool  of  private  equity  funds.

47.
It may be a corporation, partnership, trustee of a trust estate or any other entity
which  is  incorporated,  registered  or  appointed  in  or  outside  Hong  Kong.    It
can  be  wholly  or  partially  owned  by  a  non-resident  person  and  is  established
solely for the purpose of holding, directly or indirectly, and administering one
or more excepted private companies.    The term “any other entity” is included
in  the  definition  of  SPV  so  as  to  facilitate  the  use  of  various  forms  of  SPV,
such as a contractual arrangement, by the industry.

22

The SPV is not allowed to carry on any trade or activities other than
48.
for the purpose of holding, directly or indirectly, and administering one or more
excepted private companies.    It  should not engage in  an active business with
buying  and  selling  transactions  (i.e.  trading  transactions).    Equally,  it  cannot
derive  service  fees  from  the  non-resident  person  (i.e.  offshore  private  equity
fund)  for  the  provision  of  services.    The  SPV  is  expected  to  only  derive
passive dividend income from one or more excepted private companies.

Since the words “holding” and “administering” are not defined, they
49.
should be interpreted according to their literal meaning.    That is, the SPV is to
hold  and  administer  excepted  private  companies  in  the  capacity  as  a
shareholder  or  a  holder  of  participation  or  equity  interest.  The  “holding”  and
“administering” of an excepted private company can be direct or through other
persons.      It  should  not  be  interpreted  as  the  management  of  the  business  of
the excepted private companies.    That is, the maintenance and administration
of the business of excepted private companies would not be allowed.    Hence,
the activities of the SPV are restricted to: the review of financial statements of
excepted  private  companies  normally  made  available  to  shareholders  or
investors; attending the shareholders’ meetings of excepted private companies;
opening bank accounts for collection of dividends or investment receipts; and
appointing company secretary and auditor.

The  SPV  in  this  context  is  not  meant  to  be  an  excepted  private
50.
company.    In  practice,  the  excepted  private  company  can  be  identified  after
examining the transactions and having regard to the fund documents, including
the investment mandate of the offshore private equity fund.

Interposed SPV

51.

The term “interposed SPV” is defined to mean:

(a)         in relation to an SPV that has an indirect beneficial interest
in  an  excepted  private  company  through  an  interposed
person that is an SPV, means the interposed person; or

(b)

in relation to an  SPV that has an indirect beneficial interest
in an excepted private company through a series of 2 or more
interposed  persons  that  are  SPVs,  means  any  of  the
interposed persons.

23

52.
The  definition  of  “interposed  SPV”  has  made  it  clear  that  an
interposed  SPV  is  also  an  SPV,  the  “interposed  SPV”  will  only  be  exempt  to
the  extent  corresponding  to  the  percentage  of  shares  or  interests  held  by  the
non-resident  person  which  is  exempt  under  section  20AC(1).    An  SPV
indirectly owned by a non-resident person is an “interposed SPV”.

Example 9

Limited  Partnership  F1  was  a  non-resident  private  equity  fund.    It
held  100%  of  the  share  capital  in  Company  F2  in  Jurisdiction  F2,
through  two  wholly  owned  SPVs,  Company  SPV1  and  Company
SPV2, which were both Hong Kong incorporated companies without
any trade or business activities in Hong Kong other than the holding
of  the  share  capital  in  Company  F2.    Company  SPV1  held
Company SPV2, which in turn held Company F2.    Company F2 did
not carry on any business or hold any immovable property in Hong
Kong.    Company  F2  did  not  have  interests  in  any  other  private
companies.

Company SPV1 was an SPV and Company SPV2 was an interposed
SPV.    They both fell within the definition of SPV.    They were used
by Limited Partnership F1 to hold its equity investment in Company
F2.    Limited  Partnership  F1  would  be  exempt  from  tax  under
section  20AC(1)  on  profits  derived  from  disposal  of  shares  in
Company  SPV1  (i.e.  an  SPV).    Company  SPV1  would  be  exempt
from  payment  of  tax  under  section  20ACA(1)  on  profits  derived
from disposal of shares in Company SPV2 (i.e. an interposed SPV).
Company SPV2 would be exempt from payment of tax under section
20ACA(1) on profits derived from disposal of shares in Company F2
(i.e. an excepted private company).

53.
Depending on the market conditions, an offshore private equity fund
may  sell  its  investment  in  an  excepted  private  company  to  another  strategic
investor or to the public through an initial public offering (IPO).    If the private
equity  fund  sells  its  investment  in  the  excepted  private  company  through  an
IPO,  it  is  in  substance  no  different  from  a  transaction  in  listed  securities  or  a
transaction in securities of an excepted private company.    That is, the offshore
private  equity  fund  will  continue  to  be  eligible  for  profits  tax  exemption  in

24

respect  of  the  divestment  if  the  conditions  in  paragraph  16  above  remain
satisfied.    Conversely,  if  a  listed  company  after  privatisation  is  sold  as  an
excepted private company, the offshore private equity fund will continue to be
exempt from profits tax provided the same conditions have been fulfilled.

Where an offshore private equity fund carries on any other business
54.
in Hong Kong other than the specified transactions and transactions incidental
to the carrying out of specified transactions, it will lose its tax exemption status
because  of  the  provision  in  section  20AC(3).    For  example,  an  offshore
private equity fund invests in a number of overseas private companies, one of
which is carrying on business or holding an immovable property in Hong Kong
(i.e. only one overseas private company fails to qualify as an excepted private
company).    Transacting in the securities of that overseas private company will
taint  the  investments  in  other  overseas  private  companies.    Clearly,  the
offshore  private  equity  fund  is  not  eligible  for  profits  tax  exemption  under
section 20AC.

LOSS FROM EXEMPT TRANSACTIONS

Tax Treatment

Profits  from  specified  transactions  are  exempt  from  tax.    As  a
55.
matter  of  symmetry,  losses  sustained  by  a  tax-exempt  offshore  private  equity
fund  from  specified  transactions  in  a  year  of  assessment  are  not  available  for
set  off  against  any  of  its  assessable  profits  for  any  subsequent  year  of
assessment.    Likewise,  losses  sustained  by  an  SPV  as  defined  by  section
20ACA(2)  from  a  transaction  referred  to  in  section  20ACA(1)  in  a  year  of
assessment are not available for set off against any of its assessable profits for
any  subsequent  year  of  assessment.    The  treatment  is  similar  to  that  for
offshore  profits  and  capital  gains.    Since  offshore  profits  or  capital  gains  are
not  taxed,  offshore  or  capital  losses  are  not  allowed  to  set  off  against  the
assessable profits of a person.

25

ANTI-ABUSE PROVISIONS

Resident person with 30% or more interest

56.
Both  section  20AE  and  20AF  are  anti-abuse  provisions  to  prevent
abuse or round-tripping by resident persons, disguised as non-resident persons,
to  take  advantage  of  the  exemption.    Section  20AF  also  prevents  booking  of
profits in SPVs without distributing to the fund.

57.
When  a  resident  person,  either  alone  or  jointly  with  his  associates,
holds  a  beneficial  interest  of  30%  or  more  in  a  tax-exempt  offshore  private
equity fund, or any percentage if the offshore private equity fund is the resident
person’s  associate,  the  resident  person  is  deemed  under  section  20AE  to  have
derived assessable profits in respect of the profits earned by the fund from the
specified  transactions  and  incidental  transactions  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong.
When  the  fund  has  a  beneficial  interest  in  an  SPV  that  is  exempt  from  the
payment  of  tax  in  respect  of  its  assessable  profits  from  transactions  falling
within section 20ACA(1)(a) to (c), the resident person is deemed under section
20AF to have derived assessable profits in respect of profits earned by the SPV.

58.
commencing on 1 April 2015.

The  provisions  in  section  20AF  apply  from  the  year  of  assessment

Ascertainment of deemed profits

The  amount  of  assessable  profits  deemed  under  section  20AE  to
59.
have been derived by a resident person for a year of assessment is ascertained
in  accordance  with  Schedule  15  to  the  Ordinance.    The  amount  of  the
assessable  profits  deemed  under  section  20AF  to  have  been  derived  by  a
resident  person  for  a  year  of  assessment  is  ascertained  in  accordance  with
Schedule 15A.

60.
Under section 20AE, the amount of deemed assessable profits will be
the total sum by adding up the amount ascertained by the formula in paragraph
62  for  each  day  in  the  period  during  which  the  resident  person  has  the
following  percentage  of  direct  and/or  indirect  beneficial  interest  in  the
tax-exempt offshore fund:

26

(a)

alone or jointly with his associates, 30% or more; or

(b)

any  percentage  if  the  offshore  fund  is  the  resident  person’s
associate.

The  amount  of  section  20AF  deemed  assessable  profits  will  be  the
61.
total sum by adding up the amount ascertained by the formula in paragraph 63
for each day  in the period during which the resident person has the  following
percentage of direct and/or indirect beneficial interest in the tax-exempt SPV:

(a)

alone or jointly with his associates, 30% or more; or

(b)

any  percentage  if  the  offshore  fund  is  the  resident  person’s
associate.

62.
Part 1 of Schedule 15 sets out the following formula in ascertaining
the  amount  of  deemed  assessable  profits,  out  of  the  exempt  profits  of  an
offshore private equity fund, of the resident person for a particular day in a year
of assessment:

A

=

B    ×    C

D

where :  A  means  the  exempt  profits  of  the  offshore  fund  for  a

particular day in a year of assessment

B  means  the  extent  of  the  resident  person’s  beneficial

interest in the offshore fund on the particular day

C  means  the  exempt  profits  of  the  offshore  fund  for  the
accounting period in which the particular day falls

D  means the total number of days in the accounting period
of the offshore fund in which the particular day falls

27

Part 1 of Schedule 15A sets out the following formula in ascertaining
63.
the  amount  of  exempt  profits  of  an  SPV,  which  amount  is  regarded  as
assessable  profits  of  the  resident  person  for  a  particular  day  in  a  year  of
assessment:

A

=

B1  ×  B2  ×  C

D

where :  A  means the exempt profits of the SPV for a particular day

in a year of assessment

B1  means  the  extent  of  the  resident  person’s  beneficial
interest in the non-resident person on the particular day

B2  means  the  extent  of  the  non-resident  person’s  beneficial

interest in the SPV on the particular day

C  means the exempt profits of the SPV for the accounting
period of the SPV in which the particular day falls

D  means the total number of days in the accounting period

of the SPV in which the particular day falls

64.
Part 2 of Schedule 15A to the Ordinance provides that the extent of
the  beneficial  interest  of  the  non-resident  person  (i.e.  offshore  private  equity
fund) in the SPV is:

(a)         if  the  SPV  is  a  corporation  that  is  not  a  trustee  of  a  trust
estate,  the  percentage  of  the  issued  share  capital  (however
described)  of  the  corporation  held  by  the  non-resident
person;

(b)         if  the  SPV  is  a  partnership  that  is  not  a  trustee  of  a  trust
estate,  the  percentage  of  the  profits  of  the  partnership  to
which the non-resident person is entitled;

(c)         if  the  SPV  is  a  trustee  of  a  trust  estate,  the  percentage  in
value  of  the  trust  estate  in  which  the  non-resident  person  is
interested; or

28

(d)

if  the  SPV  is  an  entity  that  does  not  fall  within  any  of
sub-paragraphs  (a),  (b)  and  (c)  above,  the  percentage  of
ownership  interests  that  the  non-resident  person  has  in  the
entity.

A non-resident person has an indirect beneficial interest in an SPV, if
65.
he  has  a  direct  beneficial  interest  in  the  first  interposed  person  and  the  first
interposed person has a direct beneficial interest in the next interposed person
in the series and so on, and the last interposed person in the series has a direct
beneficial interest in the SPV.

The extent of a non-resident person’s indirect beneficial interest in an
66.
SPV  is  arrived  at  by  multiplying  the  percentage  of  the  non-resident  person’s
beneficial  interest  in  the  first  interposed  person  by  the  percentage  of  the  first
interposed  person’s  beneficial  interest  in  the  next  interposed  person  in  the
series  and  so  on,  and  finally  by  the  percentage  of  the  last  interposed  person’s
beneficial interest in the SPV.

Example 10

On  1  October  2014,  Company  HK,  a  company  resident  in  Hong
Kong  purchased  20%  of  the  equity  interest  in  Fund  F1,  which  is  a
tax-exempt offshore fund.    Fund F1 is not Company HK’s associate.
Company HK and its associates have no other beneficial interest in
Fund F1.

Company  SPV  is  an  SPV  wholly  owned  by  Fund  F1  used  to  hold
Company  F2  which  is  an  excepted  private  company  in  Jurisdiction
F2.    On  1  January  2016,  Company  HK  purchased  a  further  30%
equity  interest  in  Fund  F1.    Fund  F1  closes  its  accounts  on  31
March every year.    During the year ended 31 March 2016, Fund F1
derived  assessable  profits  of  $80m,  excluding  distribution  from
Company  SPV,  and  Company  SPV  derived  assessable  profits  of
$100m  from  disposal  of  shares  in  Company  F2.    Company  SPV  is
exempt from payment of tax for the year of assessment 2015/16.

29

Deemed  assessable  profits  of  Company  HK  for  the  year  of
assessment 2015/16 is computed as follows:

$80m  ×  50%  ×  (91  days  ÷  366  days)  +  $100m  ×  50%  ×  100%
×  (91 days  ÷  366 days) = $22.4m

Number  of  days  from  1  January  2016  to  31  March  2016  is  91.
Days  from  1  April  2015  (i.e.  date  of  commencement  of  the  2015
Ordinance)  to  31  December  2015  do  not  need  to  be  taken  into
account  since  Company  HK  held  a  beneficial  interest  of  20%  (i.e.
less than 30%) in Fund F1 during this period.

Deeming provisions not applicable

Section 20AF(7)  provides that the deeming provisions  do not  apply
67.
to a resident person if the Commissioner is satisfied that beneficial interests in
the  offshore  fund  concerned  are  bona  fide  widely  held.    This  subsection  is
meant  to  be  an  escape  route  in  case  a  resident  person  unintentionally  holds  a
beneficial  interest  above  the  prescribed  threshold  in  an  offshore  fund  that  is
bona fide widely held by investors.

68.
The term “bona fide widely held” has also been adopted in sections
20AE(8) and 26A(1A) of the Ordinance.  In DIPN 20 (Revised) (Mutual Funds,
Unit  Trusts  and  Similar  Investment  Schemes)  and  DIPN  43,  the  expression
“bona fide widely held” is consistently interpreted as follows:

(a)         during  the  year  of  assessment  in  question,  at  no  time  did
fewer than 50 persons hold (or have the right to become the
holders of) all of the units or shares in the scheme; and

(b)         at no time during the year did fewer than 21 persons hold (or
have the right to become the holders of) units or shares that
entitled  the  holders,  directly  or  indirectly,  to  75%,  or  more,
of the income or property of the scheme.

69.
Where the above benchmark figures are not met, the Commissioner
will  still  accept  in  practice  that  the  “bona  fide  widely  held”  requirement  has
been  satisfied  if  it  is  clear  from  the  constitutive  documents  of  the  fund  and
other  relevant  materials  that  it  was  established  with  a  view  to  wide  public

30

participation and that genuine efforts are being taken with the aim of achieving
that objective.    That is to say, there is nothing to suggest that the non-resident
fund  is  intended  to  be  a  closely  held  investment  vehicle.    The  “bona  fide
widely  held”  test  applies  to  all  offshore  funds  though  private  equity  funds  by
their nature are  unlikely  to  be widely  held.    Sovereign wealth funds, pension
funds,  central  banks  and  government  agencies  are  separate  and  independent
legal  entities  with  different  investment  mandates.    Within  a  private  equity
fund, each of them is regarded as an investor.    The fact that some investors are
sovereign  wealth  funds,  pension  funds,  central  banks  or  government  agencies
cannot  turn  the  private  equity  fund  into  a  widely-held  investment  vehicle.
However,  sovereign  wealth  funds,  pension  funds,  central  banks  and
government  agencies  may  enjoy  tax  exemption  under  sections  20AC  or
26A(1A) subject to certain conditions in respect of their own profits.

70.
To avoid double taxation, section 20AF(8) specifically provides that
a resident person is not liable to tax in respect of the deemed assessable profits
if  any  of  the  interposed  resident  persons  through  whom  he  holds  an  indirect
beneficial  interest  in  an  SPV  is  liable  to  tax  under  the  deeming  provisions  in
respect of the assessable profits of the same SPV.

Example 11

Company  HK1  held  90%  of  the  share  capital  of  Company  HK2
which  in  turn  held  70%  of  the  share  capital  of  Company  HK3.
Company  HK3  held  50%  of  the  equity  interest  in  Fund  F,  a
tax-exempt  offshore  private  equity  fund,  which  in  turn  held  an
excepted  private  company  through  Company  SPV  a  wholly  owned
special  purpose  vehicle.    Company  HK1,  Company  HK2  and
Company HK3 were all resident companies.

Per  sections  20AE(1)  and  20AF(1),  deemed  assessable  profits
representing 50% of the exempt profits of Fund F (if any) and 50%
of the exempt profits of Company SPV (if any) would be attributed
to Company HK3.

Since  Company  HK3  was  subject  to  tax  on  the  deemed  assessable
profits,  Company  HK1  and  Company  HK2  would  be  discharged
tax  per  sections  20AE(9)  and  20AF(8)
from

liability

to

31

notwithstanding  that  they  both  held  indirect  beneficial  interests  of
more than 30% (i.e. Company HK1: 90%  ×  70%  ×  50% = 31.5%;
Company HK2: 70%  ×  50% = 35%) in Fund F.

Reporting requirements

71.
Section  20AF  imposes  tax  liabilities,  which  is  similar  to  section
20AE, on a resident person in respect of the deemed assessable profits earned
by an SPV.    As with other persons chargeable to tax, the resident person bears
the  legal  obligation  of  complying  with  the  provisions  of  the  Ordinance  on
reporting chargeability, lodgment of returns, providing information, payment of
tax, etc.    Penalties under Part 14 of the Ordinance may be imposed for failures
to  comply  with  the  relevant  statutory  provisions.    In  determining  the  tax
liability  of  the  resident  person,  the  Assessor  may  be  required  to  examine  the
fund constitutive documents and accounting records of the tax-exempt offshore
private equity fund.

TAXATION OF INVESTMENT MANAGER

Arm’s length fee

While  private  equity  funds  falling  within  the  offshore  fund  regime
72.
would not be subject to profits tax, Hong Kong based investment managers or
advisors  arranging  or  conducting  the  specified  transactions  are  chargeable.
These  investment  managers  and  advisors  should  be  adequately  compensated
for their services or remunerated on an arm’s length basis.    Management and
performance  fees  based  on  a  cost-plus  formula  are  not  likely  to  have  been
determined  on  the  arm’s  length  basis,  in  particular  when  the  investment
managers  or  advisors  performed  significant  functions  and  bore  considerable
risks in Hong Kong to generate the profits of the offshore funds.

Performance fees or carried interest

Many private equity funds are organized as limited partnerships.    If
73.
the  investments  of  the  fund  yield  a  positive  return,  both  general  and  limited
partners  receive  profits,  as  the  value  of  their  share  of  the  fund  increases.
Compensation structures may vary from fund to fund, but the industry standard

32

pay formula is in general called “2 and 20”.    That is, the investment managers
take  2%  of  the  fund’s  asset  each  year  as  a  management  fee,  and  20%  of  the
profits  above  a  hurdle  rate  as  a  kind  of  performance  fee  often  described  as
“carried interest”.

Carried  interest  might  be  first  received  as  income  by  the  lead
74.
investment manager located outside Hong Kong or received as a distribution by
the general partner and then allocated to the investment manager or advisor in
Hong Kong.    Where the investment manager or advisor in Hong Kong is not
adequately  remunerated  for  its  service  after  considering  the  functions,  assets
and  risks  attributed  to  its  Hong  Kong  operations,  the  arrangement  will  be
closely  examined.    To  counteract  the  tax  benefit  which  would  otherwise  be
obtained,  the  income  accrued  to  the  lead  investment  manager  or  distributions
(unless  comparable  to  the  return  arising  on  investments  made  by  external
investors in the fund) received by the general partner may be attributed under
the general anti-avoidance provisions to the investment manager or advisor as
profits derived from management or advisory services rendered in Hong Kong.

75.
The  place  where  Hong  Kong  investment  managers  or  advisors
rendered  their  services  will  further  be  examined  before  deciding  the  extent  to
which  the  management  fees  or  carried  interest  attributable  to  the  Hong  Kong
investment  managers  or  advisors  should  be  charged  to  profits  tax.  That  is,
whether the arm’s length management fees or carried interest should be wholly
assessable.

Management  fees  and  carried  interest  might  also  be  structured  as  a
76.
distribution to fund executives of the investment manager or advisor through a
general  partner  limited  partnership  or  a  carried  interest  limited  partnership.
Since  the  fund  executives  provide  services  in  Hong  Kong,  either  as  an
employee or in an independent capacity, distributions (unless comparable to the
return arising on investments made by external investors in the fund) from the
general  partner  limited  partnership  or  the  carried  interest  limited  partnership
would  be  chargeable,  through  the  application  of  general  anti-avoidance
provisions,  to  salaries  tax  as  employment  income  or  profits  tax  as  service
income if the distributions are not genuine investment returns.

33

Example 12

Fund LP, an offshore private equity fund, was structured as a limited
partnership.    GP  LP  was  the  general  partner  of  Fund  LP  and  was
itself  a  non-resident  limited  partnership.    Carry  LP,  one  of  the
limited  partners  of  Fund  LP,  was  itself  a  non-resident  limited
partnership.    GP LP  received from Fund LP a priority profit share
which was the fee based on fund’s assets under management at a rate
of 2%.    Carry LP received from Fund LP a carried interest at a rate
of  20%  of  profits  above  a  certain  hurdle  rate,  packaged  as  an
investment return.    GP LP further allocated its profits to a general
partner  company  which  delegated,  pursuant  to  a  management
agreement,  the  asset  management  function  to  a  managing  entity
which  provided  the  asset  management  function  in  Hong  Kong.
Individual  fund  executives,  as  well  as  being  members  and/or
employees of the managing entity, were also limited partners in GP
LP  and  Carry  LP.  Part  of  the  priority  profit  share  and  carried
interest  were  allocated  directly  to  those  individual  fund  executives
from the GP LP and Carry LP.

The  priority  profit  share  received  as  professional  income  from  the
general  partner  company  by  the  managing  entity  in  Hong  Kong
would  be  assessed  to  profits  tax  as  profits  derived  from  services
provided in Hong Kong.    Individual fund executives could be taxed
on their direct allocation of the priority profit share from GP LP and
carried  interest  from  Carry  LP,  either  as  service  fee  or  employment
income  for  providing  services  in  Hong  Kong,  if  the  nature  of  the
distribution  differed  from  normal  investment  return  received  by
external  investors  and  the  service  fee  or  employment  income
allegedly  received  by  the  individual  fund  executives  were  not
computed on an arm’s length basis.    The professional income of the
managing entity could also be re-computed based on the arm’s length
principle  so  as  to  include  priority  profit  share  and  carried  interest
booked  in  GP  LP,  Carry  LP  or  the  general  partner  company.
Despite  applying  the  anti-avoidance  provisions  to  the  remuneration
arrangement of fund executives, the profits tax position of Fund LP
would not be affected.

34

TAX AVOIDANCE

General anti-avoidance provisions

77.
The Commissioner will generally act in accordance with this Note in
providing  profits  tax  exemption  to  offshore  private  equity  funds  and
administering  the  related  issues.    However,  where  tax  avoidance  is  involved,
the Commissioner will consider invoking the general anti-avoidance provisions
under sections 61 or 61A of the Ordinance as appropriate to counteract the tax
benefits obtained.

If  the  fees  received  by  investment  managers,  including  carried
78.
interest,  are  disguised  as  investment  returns,  the  general  anti-avoidance
provisions will be applied to counteract the tax benefits obtained and bring to
charge  the  fees  derived  from  the  provision  of  management  services  in  Hong
Kong.    The Commissioner however agrees that the anti-avoidance provisions
will  not  be  applied  to  arm’s  length  return  on  genuine  investment  in  the  fund
made.    The investment return is an arm’s length return if: the return is on an
investment  which  is  of  the  same  kind  as  investments  made  by  external
investors; the return on the investment is reasonably comparable to the return to
external investors on those investments; and the terms governing the return on
the investment are reasonably comparable to the terms governing the return to
external investors.    The application of the anti-avoidance provisions however
should  not  have  any  impact  on  the  treatment  of  the  offshore  fund  vehicle  or
investors.

TAX RESIDENCE

Tax residence of private equity funds

Most  private  equity  funds  are  structured  as  limited  partnerships.
79.
The  private  equity  fund  is  regarded  as  a  non-resident  person  if  the  central
management  and  control  of  the  limited  partnership  is  exercised  outside  Hong
Kong.    The  fact  that  the  general  partner  resides  in  Hong  Kong  does  not
necessarily leads to the conclusion that the central management and control of
the  private  equity  fund  is  located  in  Hong  Kong.    Where  the  central
management  and  control  of  a  private  equity  fund  is  exercised  by  the  general
partner,  the  residence  of  the  private  equity  fund  is  the  place  where  the

35

management  and  control  is  exercised  by  the  general  partner.    Though  the
central management and control may be exercised by the general partner in one
jurisdiction,  the  actual  business  operations  of  a  private  equity  fund  may  take
place elsewhere.

Tax residence of SPV

80.            Since  the  operation  of  an  SPV  is  very  restrictive  by  definition  (i.e.
holding  and  administering  excepted  private  companies  in  the  capacity  of  a
shareholder), the place of residence of the SPV, wholly or partially owned by a
non-resident  private  equity  fund,  generally  follows  that  of  the  non-resident
private  equity  fund  despite  that  the  SPV  might  be  incorporated,  registered  or
appointed in Hong Kong.

The certificate of resident status would only be issued to an SPV as a
81.
proof of its resident status for claiming tax benefits under the relevant Double
Taxation Agreement (DTA) if it can be proved that the SPV is resident in Hong
Kong.    In  deciding  whether  a  certificate  of resident  status  could  be  issued  to
an  SPV  all  the  facts  and  circumstances  would  be  examined  to  determine
whether the SPV has substantial business activities in Hong Kong (e.g. whether
the  SPV  has  a  permanent  office  or  employs  staff  in  Hong  Kong  to  hold  and
administer its investment in excepted private companies).

82.
The issue of a certificate of resident status will be refused if the SPV
is  a  mere  conduit.    In  such  a  case,  the  SPV  will  not  be  regarded  as  a  Hong
Kong tax resident.    The issue of a certificate of resident status to an SPV will
not  guarantee  that  it  will  be  successful  in  its  claim  to  treaty  benefits.    The
decision  as  to  whether  relief  from  foreign  taxes  can  be  granted  is,  ultimately,
one  to  be  made  by  the  DTA  partner.    It  will  be  up  to  the  DTA  partner  to
determine  whether  all  the  relevant  conditions  are  fulfilled  and  whether  the
benefits should be granted.
