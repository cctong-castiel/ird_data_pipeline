LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS

Basic charge

Section 14 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (the Ordinance) contains
the main charging provision for profits tax.  In short, profits tax is charged on a
person  in  respect  of  the  person’s  assessable  profits  arising  in  or  derived  from
Hong Kong from a trade, profession or business carried on by the person in Hong
Kong.    Profits  arising  in  or  derived  from  Hong  Kong  include  profits  from
business transacted in Hong Kong.  Thus, royalty income derived by a person
carrying on business in Hong Kong from intellectual properties through licensing
operations undertaken in Hong Kong is chargeable to profits tax.

Deeming provisions

2.
Section  15(1)  of  the  Ordinance  deems  certain  sums  derived  from
intellectual properties, not otherwise chargeable to tax, as trading receipts arising
in or derived from Hong Kong from a trade, profession or business carried on in
Hong Kong.   Section 15(1) does not exclude any person from chargeability to
profits tax under section 14.   It simply enlarges the scope of section 14.  The
relevant provisions are summarised as follows:

(a)

(b)

(c)

Section 15(1)(a) and (b) was introduced in 1971 to deem sums
received by or accrued to a person for the use, or the right to
the  use,  in  Hong  Kong  of  certain  intellectual  properties  as
trading receipts chargeable to profits tax.

Section 15(1)(ba) was added in 2004 to bring into charge sums
received by or accrued to a person for the use, or the right to
the use, outside Hong Kong of certain intellectual properties if
the sums are deductible in ascertaining the assessable profits of
a person under profits tax.

Section 15(1)(bb) was added in 2018 to deem sums received by
or accrued to a performer or an organizer for the assignment of,
or the agreement to assign, a performer’s right in relation to a
performance  in  Hong  Kong  as  trading  receipts  chargeable  to
profits tax.

(d)

Section 15(1)(bc) was added in 2018 to deem as trading receipts
chargeable  to  profits  tax  sums  received  by  or  accrued  to  a
person for:

(i)

the  use,  or  the  right  to  the  use,  outside  Hong  Kong  of
certain intellectual properties generated from any research
and  development  (R&D)  activity  in  respect  of  which  a
deduction is allowable under section 16B; or

(ii)

imparting or undertaking to impart knowledge connected
with  the  use  outside  Hong  Kong  of  such  intellectual
properties.

Section 15F of the Ordinance was added in 2018.  The effect is that a
3.
person  who  has  contributed  in  Hong  Kong  to  the  development,  enhancement,
maintenance, protection or exploitation (DEMPE) of any intellectual property is
to be taxed on such part of the sum accruing in respect of its exhibition or use or
related rights as is attributable to the value creation contributions in Hong Kong
even  if  the  sum  accrues  to  the  person’s  associate  who  is  a  non-Hong  Kong
resident person.

SOURCE OF ROYALTY INCOME

The broad guiding principle

4.
In determining the source of profits, the broad guiding principle is that
one  looks  to  see  what  the  person  has  done  to  earn  the  profits  in  question  and
where the person has done it.  In other words, the proper approach is to identify
the  operations  which  produced  the  relevant  profits  and  ascertain  where  those
operations took place.  The source of profits must be attributed to the operations
of the person which produce them and not to the operations of other members of
the person’s group.

5.
The operations do not comprise the whole of the person’s activities.
The  focus  is  on  establishing  the  geographical  location  of  the  person’s  profit-
producing  transactions  as  distinct  from  activities  antecedent  or  incidental  to

2

those transactions.  The Department’s views on the locality of profits are set out
in detail in the Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes (DIPN) No. 21
Locality of Profits.

Whether  royalty

6.
is
chargeable to tax in Hong Kong depends on the facts of each case.  No single
legal test is decisive.

income  derived  from

licensing  activities

Application of the broad guiding principle

Totality of facts

7.
Whether  royalty  income  derived  from  the  licensing  of  intellectual
properties  by  persons  carrying  on  business  in  Hong  Kong  is  sourced  in  Hong
Kong  and  thus  subject  to  tax  under  section  14  is  a  question  of  fact  to  be
determined  by  the  totality  of  the  facts  and  circumstances  in  each  case.
Paragraphs 8 to 10 below merely illustrate how the Commissioner would apply
the broad guiding principle in certain situations.

Licensing of intellectual properties created or developed by licensor

8.
If an intellectual property is created or developed by a person carrying on
business in Hong Kong and is licensed by the person to another person, the royalty
income so derived will generally be regarded as Hong Kong sourced income and
hence will be subject to profits tax.  The place where the licensee uses the intellectual
property  is  not  a  relevant  factor  to  determine  the  source  of  the  royalty  income.
Accordingly, even if the intellectual property is used outside Hong Kong, the income
derived from the licensing of such property will still be considered as having a source
in Hong Kong.   This is because the royalty income is primarily generated by the
person  using  the  person’s  wits  and  labour  to  create  or  develop  the  intellectual
property in Hong Kong.

Licensing of intellectual properties purchased by licensor

9.
If  a  person  has  purchased  the  proprietary  interest  of  an  intellectual
property outside Hong Kong and licenses it to another person outside Hong Kong
for  use  outside  Hong  Kong,  the  royalty  income  so  derived  will  generally  be

3

regarded as non-Hong  Kong sourced income  and hence will not be  subject to
profits  tax.    Accordingly,  if  the  intellectual  property  is  a  patent  right,  right  to
know-how or specified intellectual property right (SIPR), no deduction will be
allowed for the capital expenditure incurred on acquiring the patent right, right
to know-how or SIPR in accordance with section 16EC(4)(b).  Section 16EA(11)
defines SIPR to mean a copyright, performer’s economic right, protected layout-
design  (topography)  right,  protected  plant  variety  right,  registered  design  or
registered trade mark.

Sublicensing of intellectual properties

10.
If a person only obtains a licence to use an intellectual property from
its  owner  (i.e.  the  person  has  not  obtained  the  proprietary  interest  of  the
intellectual property) and then sub-licenses the intellectual property to another
person  for  use  outside  Hong  Kong,  the  Commissioner  will,  in  ascertaining
whether the royalty income so derived is sourced in Hong Kong, take the place
of acquiring and granting the licence as the location of income.  As such, if the
person acquires in Hong Kong the licence for use of the intellectual property and
grants  a  sub-licence  in  Hong  Kong,  the  royalty  income  derived  from  sub-
licensing the intellectual property will be regarded as having been derived from
Hong  Kong.    As  the  person  has  not  acquired  the  proprietary  interest  of  the
intellectual property, including a patent right, right to know-how or SIPR, the
person is not eligible to obtain the deduction for the capital expenditure incurred
on  the  intellectual  property.    The  licence  fee  incurred  by  the  person  will  be
deductible  if  it  satisfies  the  conditions  provided  under  the  general  deduction
provisions of section 16(1).

Application of the deeming provisions

Exhibition or use of cinematograph films, etc. in Hong Kong

11.
Section  15(1)(a)  brings  into  chargeable  income  the  sums,  not
otherwise taxable, received by or accrued to a person from the exhibition or use
in Hong Kong of cinematograph or television film or tape, any sound recording,
or any advertising material connected with such items.  In Turner Entertainment
Networks Asia Inc v CIR [2015] 3 HKLRD 295, the Court of Appeal interpreted
the  phrase  “exhibition  or  use”  as  meaning  “exhibition  or  other  use”.    Thus,

4

exhibition  is  simply  a  form  of  use  of  intellectual  property  for  the  purpose  of
interpreting section 15(1)(a).

Use or right to the use of patents, trade mark, etc. in Hong Kong

Section  15(1)(b)  deems  as  trading  receipts  sums  received  by  or
12.
accrued  to  a  person  for  the  use,  or  the  right  to  the  use,  in  Hong  Kong  of  any
patent, design, trade mark, copyright material, layout-design (topography) of an
integrated  circuit,  performer’s  right,  plant  variety  right,  secret  process  or
formula, or other property or right of a similar nature, and sums for imparting or
undertaking to impart knowledge directly or indirectly connected with the use in
Hong Kong of such property or right.

In  the  case  of  layout-design  (topography)  of  an  integrated  circuit,
13.
performer’s right and plant variety right, section 15(1)(b) does not apply to sums
received or accrued before 29 June 2018.

Use or right to the use of patents, trade mark, etc. outside Hong Kong

For the purposes of section 15(1)(b), an intellectual property will not
14.
be regarded as “used in Hong Kong” if a person carrying on a business in Hong
Kong pays royalty fees for the use, or right to the use, of the intellectual property
outside  Hong  Kong,  even  though  profits  derived  by  the  person  from  goods
manufactured  or  sold  outside  Hong  Kong  are  chargeable  to  profits  tax.    The
Court of Final Appeal in CIR v Emerson Radio Corporation (1999) 2 HKCFAR
501 held that:

(a)

(b)

The  rights  conferred  by  registration  of  trade  marks  are
territorial.    Section  15(1)(b)  had  no  application  on  royalty
receipts paid for the use of trade marks registered outside Hong
Kong in respect of sales outside Hong Kong.

The  application  of  a  trade  mark  to  goods  by  a  manufacturer
constitutes “use” of that mark.  Only royalty income relating to
goods manufactured in Hong Kong could be chargeable to tax
under  section  15(1)(b)  and  royalty  income  paid  in  respect  of
goods manufactured outside Hong Kong was not chargeable.

5

15.
In view of the court decision, section 15(1)(ba) was added in 2004 to
bring into charge sums, not otherwise taxable, received by or accrued to a person
for the use, or the right to the use, outside Hong Kong of any intellectual property
enumerated  in  section  15(1)(b),  which  are  deductible  in  ascertaining  the
assessable profits of a person for the purposes of profits tax.  Section 15(1)(ba)
was enacted to maintain a tax symmetry to avoid possible loss of revenue.  The
effect is that section 15(1)(b) applies to cases where the use, or the right to the
use,  of  an  intellectual  property  is  in  Hong  Kong  whereas  section  15(1)(ba)
applies when the use, or the right to the use, of an intellectual property is outside
Hong Kong.

16.
Section 15(1)(ba) does not apply to sums received or accrued before
29  June  2018  for  the  use,  or  the  right  to  the  use,  of  any  layout-design
(topography) of an integrated circuit, performer’s right and plant variety right.

Example 1

Company-F1 was the owner of a trade mark registered in Hong Kong,
Jurisdiction-F1,  Jurisdiction-F2  and  several  other  jurisdictions.
During  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19,  Company-HK,  which  was
carrying on a manufacturing business in Hong Kong, paid royalty fee
of $500,000 to Company-F1 for the use of the trade mark on goods
manufactured  in  Jurisdiction-F2  under  a  processing  arrangement.
The  manufactured  goods  were  directly  shipped  to  overseas  markets
without passing through Hong Kong.  Company-HK was allowed full
deduction of the royalty fee paid.

Section  15(1)(b)  had  no  application  on  the  royalty  fee  received  by
Company-F1 because the royalty fee was not paid for the use of the
trade mark in Hong Kong.  However, section 15(1)(ba) would apply
to  deem  the  whole  of  the  royalty  fee,  which  was  deductible  in
ascertaining  Company-HK’s  assessable  profits,  as  trading  receipts
arising
from  Hong  Kong  by  Company-F1
notwithstanding that the trade mark was used outside Hong Kong.

in  or  derived

6

Example 2

Facts are the same as Example 1 except that the goods manufactured
in Jurisdiction-F2 were shipped back to Hong Kong for domestic sales
and for re-export.

Since the trade mark was attached to the goods, the import of the goods
into Hong Kong, the sale of the goods in Hong Kong and the re-export
of the goods from Hong Kong would constitute the use of the trade
mark  in  Hong  Kong  within  the  meaning  of  section  15(1)(b).    The
royalty fee for the use of the trade mark in Hong Kong received by
Company-F1 would be chargeable under section 15(1)(b).

If the royalty fee paid by Company-HK was partly attributable to the
use of the trade  mark in Jurisidction-F2, that  part of the royalty fee
received by Company-F1 would be chargeable under section 15(1)(ba).

Use or right to the use of intellectual properties generated from research and
development activities in Hong Kong

17.
Section 15(1)(bc) was added in 2018 to deem as trading receipts sums,
not otherwise taxable, received by or accrued to a person for the use, or the right
to  the  use,  outside  Hong  Kong  of  any  intellectual  property  or  know-how
generated from any R&D activity in respect of which a deduction is allowable
under  section  16B  in  ascertaining  profits  of  the  person,  or  for  imparting  or
undertaking to impart knowledge directly or indirectly connected with the use
outside Hong Kong of any such property or know-how.

18.
For the purposes of section 15(1)(bc), the term “intellectual property”
includes copyright material, design, layout-design (topography) of an integrated
circuit,  patent,  plant  variety  right,  secret  process  or  formula,  and  any  other
property or right of a similar nature.  The term “know-how” is defined to mean
any  industrial  information  or  techniques  likely  to  assist  in  the  manufacture  or
processing of goods or materials.  Section 15(1)(bc) does not apply to sums received
or accrued before 2 November 2018.  Detailed reference can be found in paragraphs
113 to 115 of DIPN No. 55 Deduction for Research and Development Expenditure.

7

Use or right to the use of intellectual properties with value creation contributions
in Hong Kong

19.
Section  15F  was  added  in  2018  to  give  effect  to  the  guidance  in
Chapter  VI  of  the  OECD  Transfer  Pricing  Guidelines  for  Multinational
Enterprises  and  Tax  Administrations  in  relation  to  intangibles.    The  guidance
aims to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) issues resulting from the
transfer  of  intangibles  among  members  of  a  multinational  enterprise  (MNE)
group.  In gist, profits associated with the transfer and use of intangibles should
be  appropriately  allocated  among  MNE  group  members  on  the  basis  of  their
contributions to value creation.

20.
value creation contributions in Hong Kong.  It provides that:

Section 15F aligns taxation of income from intellectual properties with

Where—

(a)

a person has contributed to the value creation of an intellectual
property in Hong Kong through

(i)  performing the functions of and assuming risks relating to

the DEMPE of the intellectual property; or

(ii)  providing  assets  in  and  assuming  risks  relating  to  the

DEMPE of the intellectual property; and

(b)

a  sum  is  derived  by  the  person’s  non-Hong  Kong  resident
associate for the exhibition or use of, or a right to exhibit or use,
the intellectual property; or for the imparting or undertaking to
impart knowledge connected with the use of such intellectual
property,

the  part  of  the  sum  that  is  attributable  to  the  value  creation
contributions in Hong Kong will be regarded as a Hong Kong sourced
trading receipt and the person will be taxed accordingly in respect of
the attributable sum.

8

21.
The rationale is that a person who performs any part of the DEMPE
functions in Hong Kong in relation to an intellectual property can be regarded as
the economic owner (in part or in whole) of the intellectual property so created,
rather than purely looking at the matter from  the legal ownership perspective.
Section 15F applies in relation to a year of assessment beginning on or after
1  April  2019.    Detailed  reference  can  be  found  in  paragraphs  17  to  22  of
Appendix 5 to DIPN No. 59 Transfer Pricing between Associated Persons.

Meaning of “use” and “right to the use”

Section 15(1)(a) imposes charge of profits tax on sums received from
22.
the exhibition or use in Hong Kong of copyright materials.  Sections 15(1)(b),
(ba) and (bc) and 15F impose charge on sums received for the “use” or the “right
to the use” of intellectual properties.

23.
The  meanings  of  the  words  “use”  and  “right  to  the  use”  have  been
deliberated in Turner.  Barma JA, who delivered the main judgment in the Court
of Appeal, expressed the view that section 15(1)(a) requires an actual exhibition
or  use  of  copyright  materials  whereas  there  is  no  such  requirement  in  section
15(1)(b) or (ba).  It was held that the word “use” in section 15(1)(b) and (ba)
should  generally  be  given  an  ordinary  and  non-technical  meaning  and  should
include “exhibition”.  Even if there was no actual exhibition of the “media works”
or use of the intellectual property as required under section 15(1)(a), the fees paid
for the “right”  to exhibit or use them are assessable under section  15(1)(b)  or
(ba).  The Commissioner considers that the same interpretation should equally
apply to sections 15(1)(bc) and 15F.

Assignment of performer’s right

24.
Sums, not otherwise taxable, received by or accrued to a performer or
an organizer for an assignment of, or an agreement to assign, a performer’s right
in relation to a performance given by the performer in Hong Kong are deemed
under section 15(1)(bb) to be trading receipts arising in or derived from Hong
Kong from a trade, profession or business carried on in Hong Kong.

25.
and “organizer” have the following meanings:

For  the  purposes  of  section  15(1)(bb),  “performance”,  “performer”

9

(a)

(b)

(c)

“performance” has the meaning given by section 200(2) of the
Copyright Ordinance (Cap. 528) – a dramatic performance, a
musical performance, a reading or recitation of a literary work,
a performance of an artistic work, an expression of folklore or
a performance of a variety act or any similar presentation which
is, or  so far as it is, an unfixed performance  given by  one or
more individuals;

“performer”  has  the  meaning  given  by  section  200(2)  of  the
Copyright Ordinance – an actor, singer, musician, dancer or any
other  person  who  acts,  sings,  delivers,  declaims,  plays  in,
interprets, or otherwise performs a performance;

“organizer” means a person who obtains a performer’s right in
a  performance
the
participation of the performer in the performance or managing
the performance.

through  arranging

in  Hong  Kong

26.
Section 15(1)(bb) seeks to ensure that receipts which arise from or are
in  connection  with  a  performance  given  in  Hong  Kong  by  a  performer  are
chargeable to tax here.  Sums received for an assignment of, or an agreement to
assign, a performer’s right are trading receipts of a performer.  Such sums are no
different  from  the  performance  fees  received  by  the  performer  since  they  are
derived  directly  or  indirectly  from  giving  the  performances.    Where  the
performances are given in Hong Kong, section 15(1)(bb) makes it clear that such
sums are trading receipts chargeable to profits tax in Hong Kong.

COMPUTATION OF ASSESSABLE PROFITS UNDER SECTION 21A

Application of the 30% rate

27.
Under section 21A, the assessable profits in respect of a sum specified
in  section  15(1)(a),  (b)  or  (ba)  are  deemed  to  be  30%  of  the  sum  received  or
accrued  except  where  the  intellectual  property  was  previously  “owned”  by  a
person carrying on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong and the sum is

10

paid or accrues to an “associate”.  In the latter case, 100% of the sum paid or
accrued is taken as the assessable profits.

Application of the 100% rate

The purpose of deeming 100% of the sum as assessable profits is to
28.
counter attempts made to abuse section 21A by entering into arrangements with
overseas associates.  Typically, a section 21A “scheme” involved a Hong Kong
company  making  use  of  an  intellectual  property  it  had  developed  “in-house”.
Whilst the Hong Kong company retained ownership of the intellectual property,
it did not incur any deductible expense in respect of its use.  The scheme was for
the  Hong  Kong  company  to  enter  into  a  “sale  and  license  back”  arrangement
with  a  subsidiary  operating  outside  Hong  Kong.    The  Hong  Kong  company
transferred ownership of the intellectual property of a kind referred to in section
15(1)(a), (b) or (ba) to the subsidiary operating outside Hong Kong which then
granted back to the Hong Kong company, for a substantial royalty, the right to
continue to use the intellectual property in Hong Kong.  The tax purpose was for
the  Hong  Kong  company  to  obtain  a  deduction  under  section  16(1)  of  the
Ordinance,  for  the  full  amount  of  the  royalty,  with  the  subsidiary  operating
outside Hong Kong being taxed under section 21A on only 30% of the royalty it
received.  In other words, funds remained within the group but a 70% deduction
was created in respect of the royalty involved.

29.
However,  straightforward  application  of  the  100%  rate  would  be
restrictive, in the sense that if the 100% rate were to apply to all payments to
associates, it could have an adverse bearing on the importation of technologies
into Hong Kong by MNEs.  In the absence of any indication that section 21A
had been exploited by MNEs in respect of technologies developed overseas, a
provision was added to exclude the relevant payments from the application of
the  100%  rate  under  a  certain  circumstance.    Proviso  to  section  21A(1)(a)
provides that the 100% rate would not apply in respect of any sum derived from
an associate “where the Commissioner is satisfied that no person carrying on a
trade,  profession  or  business  in  Hong  Kong  has  at  any  time  wholly  or  partly
owned the property in respect of which the sum is paid”.  In such cases, and also
where a relevant sum is derived from a person who is not an associate, the 100%
rate would not apply.

11

Meaning of “owned”

For  the  purposes  of  section  21A,  the  Commissioner  accepts  that
30.
“owned” refers to direct ownership.  For example, although a shareholder is a
proportionate owner of a company, the shareholder does not own the assets of
the  company  –  they  are  owned  by  the  company  itself  as  a  separate  and
independent legal entity.

If a sum is to be paid to an associate and either the person responsible
31.
for making the payment or the recipient considers that the ownership history of
the  relevant  intellectual  property  is  such  that  the  Commissioner  would  be
satisfied in terms of the proviso referred to above, confirmation may be obtained
by way of an advance ruling from the Commissioner as to whether the lower rate
of  30%  is  applicable.    It  should,  however,  be  noted  that  rulings  will  not  be
provided in respect of hypothetical situations.

Meaning of “associate”

32.
Generally, in considering whether the assessable profits in respect of
a  relevant  sum  should  be  taken  to  be  30%  or  100%,  the  first  question  to  be
determined  is  whether  the  sum  was  derived  from  an  associate.  The  term
“associate” is defined widely in section 21A(3) in order to prevent circumvention
of  the  provisions  by  the  interposition  of  third  parties.    For  the  purpose  of
ascertaining whether a sum was derived from an associate, regard must also be
had to section 21A(2), which covers the situation where a sum was derived from
or by a trustee of a trust estate or a corporation controlled by such a trustee.  In
such cases, the sum is deemed to have been derived from or by, as the case may
be, each of the trustee, the corporation and the beneficiary under the trust.

33.
The provisions concerning “associate”, and the related definitions in
section  21A(3)  of  “associated  corporation”,  “beneficiary  under  the  trust”,
“control”,  “principal  officer”  and  “relative”,  are  along  similar  lines  to  those
contained in sections 16EC and 39E of the Ordinance.

12

Recipient carrying on business in Hong Kong

If the sums for the use of an intellectual property are received by or
34.
accrue to a person carrying on a business in Hong Kong, the assessable profits
on the recipient’s income are subject to profits tax under section 14, and section
21A does not apply: see Lam Soon Trademark Limited v CIR (2006) 9 HKCFAR
391.    The  primary  function  of  section  15(1)  is  “to  bring  in  something  which
would otherwise be excluded”.  Section 15 does not exclude any person from
chargeability to profits tax under section 14.  If a person is chargeable to profits
tax under section 14, there is simply no need to resort to section 15(1).  Where
an  assessment  was  originally  made  on  the  basis  of  sections  15  and  21A,  an
additional assessment under section 60 can be made if it was subsequently found
that the proper charging section should be section 14.

DTA TERRITORY RESIDENT PERSON

Royalties Article of DTA

Royalties  arising  in  Hong  Kong  and  beneficially  owned  by  a  DTA
35.
territory resident person will be taxed at the rate specified in the DTA.  The rate
specified in the DTA will not apply if the person is not the beneficial owner of
the royalty income.   A person will be regarded as the beneficial owner of the
income if the person enjoys the full privilege to directly benefit from that income.
In Indofood International Finance Ltd v JP Morgan Chase Bank CA [2006] STC
1195,  it  was  confirmed  that,  in  line  with  the  OECD  Commentary,  beneficial
ownership  should  be  understood  in  its  context  and  in  light  of  the  object  and
purposes of the DTA, including avoiding double taxation and the prevention of
fiscal evasion and avoidance.

If  the  rate  specified  in  the  DTA  is  higher  than  that  provided  in  the
36.
Ordinance,  the  DTA  territory  resident  person  is  liable  to  tax  on  the  deemed
trading  receipts  under  section  15(1)  at  the  lower  rate.    However,  the  business
profits  article,  and  not  the  royalties  article,  will  apply  if  the  DTA  territory
resident person carries on business in Hong  Kong in which the royalties arise
through  a  permanent  establishment  situated  in  Hong  Kong  and  the  right  or
property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with

13

such permanent establishment.  In such case, the royalty income will form part
of  the  business  income  of  the  permanent  establishment  and  be  chargeable  to
profits tax under section 14.

Example 3

In the year of assessment 2018/19, Company-HK paid royalties of $1
million  to  Company-F,  a  company  incorporated  in  Jurisdiction-F.
The royalty payment was accepted as a deductible expenditure.  The
DTA  entered  into  between  Hong  Kong  and  Jurisdiction-F  provided
that the tax charged on royalties should not exceed 3%.  Company-F
did  not  carry  on  business  in  Hong  Kong  and  a  connected  entity  of
Company-F was nominated to be chargeable at the two-tiered rates.

If the Commissioner was satisfied that the 100% tax rate under section
21A(1)(a) should not be applied, the tax payable would be the lower
of:

(a)  Tax  payable  under  section  14(3)  as  modified  by  section

14AAC(3)(b) of the Ordinance:

$1,000,000 × 30% × 16.5% ﹣$20,000 (tax reduction)
 = $29,500

(b)  Tax payable per DTA:

$1,000,000 × 3% = $30,000

The lesser of (a) and (b) would be $29,500.

Example 4

Facts are the same as Example 3 except that the royalty payment made
by Company-HK was $2 million.

If the Commissioner was satisfied that the 100% tax rate under section
21A(1)(a) should not be applied, the tax payable would be the lower
of:

14

(a)

Tax  payable  under  section  14(3)  as  modified  by  section
14AAC(3)(b) of the Ordinance:
$2,000,000 × 30% × 16.5% ﹣$20,000 (tax reduction)
= $79,000

(b)

Tax payable per DTA:
$2,000,000 × 3% = $60,000

The lesser of (a) and (b) would be $60,000.

Rate in DTA not applied

37.
Where  general  anti-avoidance  provisions  are  invoked  or  the  royalty
income derived from an associate is assessed under the specific anti-avoidance
provisions in section 21A(1)(a), the DTA territory resident person cannot take
the benefit of paying tax at the lower rate specified in the DTA.

38.
The  principal  purpose  of  a  DTA  is  clear:  elimination  of  double
taxation  with  respect  to  taxes  on  income  and  on  capital  without  creating
opportunities  for  non-taxation  or  reduced  taxation  through  tax  evasion  or
avoidance.    Hence,  a  proper  construction  of  a  DTA  would  allow  the
Commissioner  to  disregard  abusive  transactions  entered  into  with  a  view  to
obtaining unintended benefits under the provisions of the DTA.

Example 5

Facts  are  the  same  as  Example  3  except  that  the  Commissioner
considered that section 21A(1)(a) should be invoked to take 100% of
the royalty income as assessable profits.

Tax payable under section 14(3) as modified by section 14AAC(3)(b)
of the Ordinance:
$1,000,000 × 16.5% ﹣$20,000 (tax reduction)
= $145,000

Since section 21A(1)(a) was invoked by the Commissioner, the rate specified in
the DTA would not apply.  In this case, the tax payable would be $145,000.

ADVANCE RULINGS

Application for advance ruling

39.
Section 88A of the Ordinance provides that the Commissioner may,
on an application made by a person, make a ruling on any of the matters specified
in Schedule 10.  A person may apply to the Commissioner for an advance ruling
concerning  the  application  of  section  21A.    When  seeking  for  a  ruling,  the
applicant must disclose all relevant information known to him and provide the
information specified by the Commissioner.  DIPN No. 31 Advance Rulings sets
out  in  detail  the  procedures  of  applying  for  a  tax  ruling  and  the  documents
required.

Given  the  nature  of  the  intellectual  property  involved,  cases  with  a
40.
complicated history of ownership should be the exception rather than the rule.
The  current  owner  of  the  intellectual  property  should  know  the  details  of  the
person, if any, from whom the intellectual property had been purchased.  In many
cases,  the  relevant  intellectual  property  would  have  been  developed  by  the
current owner and, as such, there would not be a previous owner.

41.
Generally,  where  the  information  referred  to  above  is  provided,  it
should  be  sufficient  to  allow  a  ruling  to  be  made  by  the  Commissioner  or  an
authorised  officer.    In  some  cases,  however,  it  may  be  necessary  for  the
Commissioner  to  seek  further  information  from  the  applicant  or  a  third  party
before a ruling can be given.

42.
A  case  by  case  approach  will  be  adopted  by  the  Commissioner  in
relation to the issue of rulings.  Accordingly, a ruling given in one case should
not  be  regarded  as  requiring  the  Commissioner  to  issue  a  like  ruling  in  a
subsequent similar case.
