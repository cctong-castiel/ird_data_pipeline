THE RULES

Tax on profits or income

For  profits  tax  purposes,  all  outgoings  and  expenses  not  capital  in
nature, to the extent to which they are incurred in the production of chargeable
profits, are allowable for deduction under section 16(1).  Since a tax on profits
or  income  is  an  application  of  the  profits  and  not  an  outgoing  or  expense
incurred  in  producing  chargeable  profits,  the  tax  is  not  deductible.    The
assessable profits of a trade, profession or business are the profits before, and
not after, deduction of profits tax.

2.
Specifically,  section  17(1)(g)  provides  that  no  deduction  shall  be
allowed  in  respect  of  any  tax  paid  or  payable  under  the  Inland  Revenue
Ordinance  (IRO)  other  than  salaries  tax  paid  in  respect  of  employees’
remuneration.  Equally, foreign taxes on profits or income (e.g. withholding tax
on royalties, licensing  fees, service fees and  management fees), subject to  the
provisions in section 16(1)(c), are not deductible.

In  Attorney  General  v  Ashton  Gas  Company  [1906]  AC  10,  it  was
3.
held  that  profits  ought  to  be  calculated  as  inclusive,  and  not  exclusive,  of  the
amount payable in respect of income tax.   In Inland Revenue Commissioners v
Dowdall O’Mahoney & Co, Ltd [1952] AC 401, it was held that the tax paid in
the Irish Republic was a tax on profits and none of which was expended for the
purposes of a trade in the United Kingdom, so that none of it was deductible.

Other taxes and duties

While capital gains tax is disallowed as being attributable to capital
4.
and  not  to  profits  or  income,  taxes  and  duties  which  are  not  calculated  by
reference to profits or  income will be considered for deduction.      These  may
include:

(a)

rates levied on properties;

(b)

vehicle licence fee;

(c)

duties on commodities; or

(d)

foreign taxes and duties not levied by reference to profits or
income,  as  in Harrods  (Buenos  Aires)  Ltd  v  Taylor-Gooby
[1964] 41 TC 450, which concerned an Argentine tax levied
on companies at a flat rate of 1 per cent of capital per annum,
irrespective of profits or income.

5.
Since  goods  and  services  tax  and  value  added  tax  paid  in  foreign
jurisdictions are not in the nature of profits tax or income tax, such taxes will
be  deductible  under  section  16(1)  if  they  are  incurred  in  the  production  of
chargeable profits.

SPECIFIED INTEREST AND GAINS

Deduction of foreign taxes on specified interest and gains

Section  16(1)(c)  allows  deduction  of  tax  of  substantially  the  same
6.
nature  as  tax  imposed  under  the  IRO,  proved  to  the  satisfaction  of  the
Commissioner  to  have  been  paid  elsewhere  other  than  in  a  territory  outside
Hong Kong with which double taxation arrangements (DTA) have been made
(DTA territory), whether by deduction or otherwise, by a person who carries on
a  trade,  profession  or  business  in  Hong  Kong,  during  the  basis  period  for  the
year  of  assessment  in  respect  of  profits  chargeable  to  tax  by  virtue  of  section
15(1)(f), (g), (i), (ia), (j), (k), (l) or (la).

Unilateral relief restricted to non-DTA territory

Section  16(2J)  restricts  the  application  of  section  16(1)(c).    With
7.
effect  from  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19,  the  unilateral  relief  from  double
taxation would not apply in relation to any tax paid in a territory by a person in
respect of the profits referred to in section 16(1)(c) if:

(a)

the territory is a DTA territory; and

(b)

under  section  50,  tax  payable  in  the  territory  by  a  Hong
Kong  resident  person  in  respect  of  the  profits  is  to  be
allowed as a credit against tax payable in Hong Kong by the
Hong Kong resident person in respect of the profits.

2

Hence, section 16(1)(c) would not be applicable if the foreign tax is paid in a
DTA  territory  and  under  the  DTA  with  that  territory,  relief  from  double
taxation is provided by way of credit under section 50.

Example 1

For the year of assessment 2018/19, Bank-HK paid an income tax in
Jurisdiction-F in respect of the interest income received.  The interest
income  was  chargeable  to  profits  tax  under  section  15(1)(i).      No
DTA has been entered into between Hong Kong and Jurisdiction-F.

Income tax paid in Jurisdiction-F would be deductible under section
16(1)(c) since Jurisdiction-F was not a DTA territory.

Reasons for enacting section 16(2J)

The  reason  for  denying  a  deduction  under  section  16(1)(c)  is  that  a
8.
DTA is intended to provide a comprehensive solution to all tax matters which
are within its scope.  The international practice is that where a DTA is in place,
relief from double taxation should be allowed under the DTA only to the extent
contemplated  by  it.    The  tax  credit  approach  is  adopted  by  Hong  Kong  in  all
existing  DTAs.    Section  16(2J)  seeks  to  ensure  that  the  DTAs  will  prevail  in
case of any conflicts between the provisions in the IRO and those in the DTAs.
Therefore,  if  the  foreign  tax  is  paid  in  a  DTA  territory  and  the  relevant  DTA
provides  relief  from  double  taxation  by  way  of  tax  credit,  a  Hong  Kong
resident  person  can  only  apply  for  a  tax  credit  under  section  50.    For  a  non-
Hong  Kong  resident  person  who  is  not  covered  by  the  relevant  DTA,  it  may
seek unilateral relief from its residence of jurisdiction or bilateral relief under
the DTA between its residence jurisdiction and the DTA territory (if any).

Example 2

Same facts as in Example 1 but Hong Kong has entered into a DTA
with Jurisdiction-F.

Income  tax  paid  in  Jurisdiction-F  would  not  be  deductible  under
section 16(1)(c) by virtue of section 16(2J).  If Bank-HK is a Hong
Kong resident person, it may claim a tax credit under section 50.
