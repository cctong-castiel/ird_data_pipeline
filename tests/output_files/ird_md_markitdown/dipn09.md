MAJOR CATEGORIES OF ALLOWABLE DEDUCTIONS

A taxpayer may claim, among other things, the following allowable

deductions for the purpose of computing his salaries tax liability –

(a)

all  outgoings  and  expenses  incurred  in  the  production  of  his
assessable income;

(b)

self-education expenses paid;

(c)

allowances  calculated  in  accordance  with  Part  VI  of  the
Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  (the  Ordinance)  in  respect  of
capital expenditure on machinery or plant the use of which is
essential to the production of his assessable income; and

(d)

approved charitable donations made.

HOW DEDUCTIONS ARE TO BE CLAIMED

2.
The  Tax  Return-Individuals  [B.I.R.  60]  provides  for  entries  to  be
made for claiming various deductions. Receipts need not be submitted with the
completed return although they should be retained for eventual verification, if
required  by  the  Department.  Since  the  onus  of  proving  the  validity  of  the
deduction  claim  is  on  the  taxpayer,  it  is  in  his  own  interest  to  keep  full  and
contemporaneous records for all his claims.

OUTGOINGS AND EXPENSES

Section  12(1)(a)  of  the  Ordinance  provides  that  deductions  may  be

3.
claimed for –

“all  outgoings  and  expenses,  other  than  expenses  of  a  domestic  or
private  nature  and  capital  expenditure,  wholly,  exclusively  and
necessarily incurred in the production of the assessable income”.

In  order  to  be  qualified  for  deduction,  therefore,  the  expenditure
4.
must satisfy each of the following tests in addition to not being expenditure of a
domestic or private nature or of a capital nature, e.g. expenditure to acquire an
asset –

(a)

it must have been “incurred”;

(b)

it must have arisen “wholly and exclusively” in the production
of the income; and

(c)

it  must  have  been  “necessary”  in  the  production  of  the
income.

“INCURRED”

The word “incurred” has been judicially considered on a number of
5.
occasions  and  the  authorities  are  generally  agreed  that  for  an  expenditure  to
have been incurred it must be an established liability or a definite commitment
which arose in the year of assessment in which it is sought to be claimed as a
deduction.  Actual  payment  during  the  year  in  question  is  not  necessary,  but
where payment has not been made before the end of that year, no deduction can
be allowed unless there existed on the last day of that year an actual and known
liability  or  obligation  of  ascertainable  amount.  A  mere  rough  estimate,  a
contingent  liability  or  an  anticipated  future  outgoing  will  not  therefore
generally rank for deduction.

“WHOLLY” AND “EXCLUSIVELY”

These  words  are  not  to  be  considered  too  narrowly.  Where
6.
expenditure is incurred for more than one purpose (e.g. running expenses of a
car  used  partly  for  private  purposes),  such  expenditure  should  be  apportioned
(usually on a mileage basis), and the part attributable to the employment would
be allowed, provided the other tests are satisfied.

2

“NECESSARILY”

The word “necessarily” is to be construed as meaning essential to the
7.
conduct of the employment. It is not sufficient that the expenditure is related to
the production of the income and possibly facilitates and aids the production of
income. The basic test is whether the expenditure is vital to the employment to
the extent that it would not be possible for the taxpayer to produce the income
from the employment without incurring that expenditure. If the duties imposed
by the employer require the expenditure to be incurred, one would expect that
the employer will pay for such expenditure. Hence, it is hard for an employee
to  claim  that  he  has  paid  for  expenditure  that  his  duties  require  him  to  incur,
unless  in  the  contract  of  employment  the  employee  is  required  to  bear  the
necessary expenses. However, it does not follow that because the employer has
required the expenditure to be incurred by the employee that such expenditure
is  necessarily  admissible:  the  test  is  “not  whether  the  employer  imposes  the
expense  but  whether  the  duties  do,  in  the  sense  that,  irrespective  of  what  the
employer may prescribe, the duties cannot be performed without incurring that
particular outlay”. [Brown v. Bullock 40 TC 1.]

“IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE ASSESSABLE INCOME”

The meaning of this phrase had been discussed in the Supreme Court
8.
case  of  Commissioner  of  Inland  Revenue  v.  Humphrey,  HKTC  451  together
with the wording in similar provisions in the United Kingdom Income Tax Acts
[“in the performance of the duties”] and the Australian Income Tax Assessment
Act  [“in  gaining  or  producing  the  assessable  income”].  The  judgment  in  the
Supreme Court was made on the basis that as far as the appeal in that case was
concerned (a claim for travelling expenses from home to office) the difference
in  phraseology  between  the  Taxing  Acts,  the  Hong  Kong  provision  having  a
certain affinity to the wording of the Australian Taxing Act, was immaterial.

9.
Expenses are not incurred “in the performance of the duties” if they
are incurred only to enable the duties to be performed e.g. travelling expenses
between  the  taxpayer’s  home  and  his  place  of  employment;  expenditures  to
acquire an employment or appointment; or the costs of memberships to social
or sports clubs whether or not required by the employer. It is noteworthy that
certain  of  the  items  mentioned  also  fail  to  qualify  as  allowable  deductions
under the other tests referred to in the preceding paragraphs.

3

10.
Similarly, a distinction must be drawn between an expense incurred
in  gaining  income  and  one  incurred  necessarily  for  the  purpose  of  gaining  it.
This point was considered in the court case of Commissioner of Inland Revenue
v.  Robert  P.  Burns,  1  HKTC  1181,  in  which  the  Court  rejected  the  claim  for
legal expenses incurred by a horse trainer in an appeal against disqualification:
such expenses were merely incurred for the purpose of seeing that the claimant
was not precluded from earning his assessable income and were therefore not
incurred in the production of it.

11.
Neither  would  sums  paid  upon  termination  of  the  employment
contract by an employee, e.g. payment in lieu of notice, be admissible: they are
not  incurred  in  the  production  of  income  but  are  made  in  order  to  have  the
contract  terminated  and/or  to  avoid  possible  action  for  damages  by  the
employer. [See Board of Review Case No. BR 9/78.]

EXPENSE ALLOWANCES FROM EMPLOYER

12.
Allowances  which  are  reasonable  in  amount  and  do  no  more  than
covering  the  employee’s  travelling,  accommodation  and  related  expenses
incurred when he is working away from his usual base or place of residence as
required  by  his  employer  would  not  be  brought  into  charge  as  assessable
income.  However,  any  claim  for  expenses  in  excess  of  the  employer’s
reimbursement would be expected to fail the test of “necessarily” incurred and
would  not  be  allowed.  Moreover,  a  reimbursement  from  an  employer  for
disallowable expenses incurred by an employee would be assessable.

SPECIFIC ITEMS OF EXPENDITURE

Clothing

13.
The  cost,  if  borne  by  the  employee,  of  the  replacement  of  special
clothes  required  by  the  nature  of  the  employment  would  be  allowable  (e.g.
overalls). Otherwise, the test “wholly and exclusively” would not be expected
to be complied with.

4

Commission-payment for services

to  pay
Employees  who  are  commission  earners  may  need
14.
commission  to  others  in  order  to  earn  that  income.  Provided  the  conditions
under section 12(1)(a) are satisfied, such payments are allowable deductions. It
is important though that full information about the nature of the payment and
the recipients should be provided to the Department.

Entertainment expenses

15.
The  claimant  is  expected  to  be  able  to  show  that  any  expenditure
claimed  was  necessarily  incurred  and  that  it  would  not  have  been  possible  to
have  produced  the  income  from  the  employment  without  incurring  such
expenditure. Mere social entertaining would be debarred as not being “wholly
and  exclusively  incurred”.  Any  entertaining  must  be  shown  to  have  been
necessarily  incurred  directly  as  part  of business negotiations and records kept
should  not  only  give  details  of  the  cost  and  the  names  of  the  persons
entertained  but  the  nature  of  the  business  in  question.  It  goes  without  saying
that  the  excess  of  any  round  sum  entertainment  allowance  over  admissible
entertainment  expenses  incurred  is  assessable  as  income  from  an  office  or
employment.

Payments to assistants

16.
In  general,  such  expenses  would  not  be  “necessarily”  incurred.
However, in case, for example, an employee is remunerated on a commission
basis, a claim for such payments would be admitted provided that the necessity
can  clearly  be  shown  for  the  need  of  assistance  in  the  light  of  the  volume  of
business transacted and the amounts paid can also be regarded as reasonable for
the work done.

Subscriptions to professional societies etc.

Although it is considered that subscriptions to professional societies
17.
etc. are in general not allowable under a strict interpretation of the wording of
the  Ordinance,  in  practice  an  allowance  is  admitted  where  the  holding  of  a
professional  qualification  is  a  prerequisite  of  employment  and  where  the
retention  of  membership  and  the  keeping  abreast  of  current  developments  in

5

the  particular  profession  are  of  regular  use  and  benefit  in  the  performance  of
the  duties.  Any  such  allowance  is  to  be  restricted  to  the  subscription  to  one
professional  association.  [See  Board  of  Review  Case  No.  BR  19/73.]
Subscriptions and fees paid to Trade Unions would not qualify.

Travelling expenses

18.
Reasonable  expenses  of  travel  from  one  place  of  employment  to
another  would  be  admitted,  while  expenses  of  travel  from  home  to  office  are
not.  Allowable  expenses  are  restricted  to  those  necessarily  incurred  in  the
performance of duties. If for example motor car expenses are claimed, regard
would be had as to whether the amount claimed is reasonable having regard to
the availability of public transport and taxis.

If  the  nature  of  the  employment  is  such  that  the  use  of  a  car  is
19.
necessary  to  the  carrying  out  of  the  duties,  the  claim  should  include
information  as  to  the  basis  on  which  the  employer  reimburses  expenditure
incurred, and the extent to which the car is used for purposes other than for the
employment. The cost of repairs and running expenses would be apportioned as
between private use and use for the employment.

ALLOWANCES FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

20.
Under  section  12(1)(b)  of  the  Ordinance,  “allowances  calculated  in
accordance with Part VI in respect of capital expenditure on machinery or plant
the  use  of  which  is  essential  to  the  production  of  the  assessable  income”  are
deductible. Information as to the calculation of allowances under this provision
is contained in Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 7 (Revised).

Claims  under  this  provision  would  not  arise  other  than  in  an
21.
employment  in  which  the  employer  does  not  reimburse  the  employee  for  the
use of the machinery or plant (the most common example would be a motor car)
and  where  the  employee  can  show  that  the  use  of  the  plant  or  machinery  is
essential to the performance of the duties giving rise to the assessable income.

6

SELF-EDUCATION EXPENSES

Commencing from 1 April 1996, a taxpayer can claim under section
22.
12(1)(e)  of  the  Ordinance  for  a  deduction  of  self-education  expenses  he  paid.
From  year  of  assessment  2000/01  onwards,  expenses  of  self-education  are
defined  to  include  fees,  including  tuition  and  examination  fees,  in  connection
with a prescribed course of education, fees of examination set by an education
provider, or trade, professional or business association.

23.
A  prescribed  course  of  education  is  one  undertaken  at  specified
education  providers.
Specified  education  providers  include  universities,
technical colleges, schools registered under the Education Ordinance, and any
other institutions approved by the Commissioner.    For details of the approved
institutions,  please  visit  the  Department’s  homepage  at  www.ird.gov.hk.  A
prescribed course of education also includes a training or development course
provided  by  a  trade,  professional  or  business  association.    From  the  year  of
assessment 2004/05 onwards, the term also includes a training or development
course  accredited  or  recognized  by  certain  professional  bodies,  institutions,
associations that are specified in Schedule 13 of the Ordinance.

24.
The course of education or the examination undertaken must be for
gaining  or  maintaining  qualifications  for  use  in  any  employment.  General
interest  classes,  for  example,  a  Tai  Chi  course,  will  not  qualify  as  an
employment-related  course  unless  say,  a  Tai  chi  instructor  employment  is
contemplated.

25.
Fees that have been reimbursed or are reimbursable by an employer
or any other person are not allowable.    The deduction is allowed in the year of
assessment in which the expenses were paid; the period covered by the courses
is  irrelevant.  The  total  amount  of  self-education  expenses  that  may  be
deducted  in  any  year  of  assessment  shall  not  exceed  the  amount  specified  in
relation  to  that  year  in  Schedule  3A  of  the  Ordinance.    From  year  of
assessment  2001/02  onwards,  the  maximum  amount  that  can  be  claimed  is
$40,000.

7

CONCESSIONARY DEDUCTIONS UNDER PART IVA

Section  12B(1)(a)  provides  that  in  ascertaining  the  net  chargeable
26.
income  of  a  person,  the  deductions  under  Part  IVA  comprising  approved
charitable donations, elderly residential care expenses, home loan interest and
contributions  to  recognized  retirement  schemes  shall  be  allowed  whenever
appropriate.

Approved Charitable Donations

27.
Section  26C(1)  of  the  Ordinance  provides  that  where  a  person  or
his/her  spouse,  not  being  a  spouse  living  apart  from  the  person,  makes  any
approved  charitable  donations  during  any  year  of  assessment,  a  deduction  in
respect of the aggregate amount of the approved charitable donations shall be
allowable to the person for that year of assessment provided that the aggregated
amount is not less than $100.

28.
allowable to him/her in respect of –

If  the  person  is  chargeable  to  salaries  tax,  no  deduction  shall  be

(a)

any sum which is allowable under profits tax; and

(b)

any  sum  by  which  the  aggregated  amount  of  the  approved
charitable donations is in excess of 25%1 of his/her assessable
income  for  that  year  as  reduced  by  the  deductions  provided
under section 12(1)(a) and (b) for that year of assessment. If
the  person  and  his/her  spouse  have  elected  joint-assessment
under section 10(2) of the Ordinance, then the deduction limit
is set at 25%1of the aggregate of assessable income as reduced
by deductions under section 12(1)(a) and (b).

29.
Where a person has made an election for personal assessment under
section  41  in  any  year  of  assessment,  no  deduction  shall  be  allowable  to  that
person  for  that  year  of  assessment  in  respect  of  any  approved  charitable
donation –

1

25%  is  for  any  year  of  assessment  commencing  on  or  after  1  April  2003.  For  any  year  of
assessment up to and including the year of assessment commencing 1 April 2002, the percentage is
10%.

(b)  	 which  has  been  allowed  as  a  deduction  to  his/her  spouse
against  the  total  income  of  that  spouse  that  is  required  to  be
aggregated under section 42A(1);

(c)  	 which,  when  aggregated  with  any  sum  that  is  allowable  as  a
deduction under section 16D for that year of assessment, is in

unless  agreement  is  reached  amongst  themselves,  no  allowance  for  the
contentious donation will be granted.

Fuller details on the deduction for approved charitable donations are

31.
set out in the Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 37.

Elderly Residential Care Expenses

32.
With effect from the year of assessment 1998/99, a person may claim
a deduction for elderly residential care expenses paid by the person or his/her
spouse to a residential care home in respect of his/her or his/her spouse’s parent
or grandparent under salaries tax and personal assessment. A person chargeable
to tax at standard rate is also entitled to the deduction.

The  following  conditions  must  be  satisfied  before  the  deduction  is

33.
granted –

9

(a)

(b)

the parent/grandparent is aged 60 or above at any time in the
year  of  assessment,  or  under  60  but  entitled  to  claim  an
allowance  under  the  Government’s  Disability  Allowance
Scheme; and

the  residential  care  home  is  licensed  or  exempted  from
licensing under the Residential Care Homes (Elderly Persons)
Ordinance,  or  is  a  nursing  home  registered  under  the
Hospitals, Nursing Homes and Maternity Homes Registration
Ordinance.

The  deduction  is  allowed  for  the  expenses  actually  paid  to  a
34.
residential  care  home  in  respect  of  residential  care  received,  subject  to  a
maximum of $60,000 for a year of assessment for each parent or grandparent.

35.
The deduction is allowed in respect of a parent/grandparent to only
one  claimant  for  a  year  of  assessment.  Should  the  deduction  be  allowed  to  a
person,  he  or  any  other  person
to  claim  dependent
parent/grandparent  allowance  and  additional  parent/grandparent  allowance  for
the same parent/grandparent for the same year of assessment.

is  not  entitled

For  the  purpose  of  processing  the  claim,  the  Assessor  may  ask  the

36.
claimant to produce the following information and documents –

(a)  	  particulars  of  the  parent/grandparent,  i.e.  name,  Hong  Kong
identity  card  number,  date  of  birth  and  if  aged  under  60,
reference  number  under
the  Government’s  Disability
Allowance Scheme;

(b)

the name and address of the residential care home; and

(c)

the  amount  paid  and  receipt(s)  issued  by  the  residential  care
home or other documentary evidence for the payment.

Fuller  details  on  the  deduction  for  elderly  residential  care  expenses

37.
are set out in the Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 36.

10

Home Loan Interest

With effect from the year of assessment 1998/99, home loan interest
38.
paid  is  deductible  under  section  26E  of  the  Ordinance  from  a  person’s
assessable  income  under  salaries  tax  or  from  a  person’s  total  income  under
personal assessment. A person chargeable to tax at standard rate is also entitled
to the deduction.

39.
claimant to produce the following documents –

For the purposes of processing the claim, the Assessor may ask the

(a)

proof of ownership of the dwelling;

(b)    proof of dwelling being used as his place of residence;

(c)

loan agreement or mortgage deed; and

(d)

receipts for repayment of loan.

Fuller  details  on  the  deduction  for  home  loan  interest  are  set  out  in

Contribution to Recognized Retirement Schemes

Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme (MPFS)

41.
With  effect  from  1  December  2000,  employees  (full-time  or
part-time)  and  self-employed  persons,  except  the  exempt  persons  under  the
MPFS  Ordinance,  are  required  to  participate  in  a  MPFS.  For  employees  or
self-employed  persons  earning  over  $4,000  per  month,  the  mandatory
contribution  is  5%  of  the  person’s  income.  The  maximum  contribution  is
$1,000  per  month  or  $12,000  per  year.  Insofar  as  salaries  tax  is  concerned,
section  26G(3)(b)  provides  for  deduction  of  the  amount  of  mandatory
contributions paid by a person as an employee during a year of assessment, to
the extent of the amount specified in Schedule 3B.

11

Recognized Occupational Retirement Schemes (RORS)

Where  a  person,  as  an  employee,  opts  to  participate  in  a
42.
MPF-exempted  RORS  instead  of  joining  a  MPFS,  the  amount  of  deduction
allowable under section 26G(3)(a) is the lesser of –

(i)

the  amount  of  the  contributions  paid  by  the  person  to  the
RORS; and

(ii)

the  amount  of  the  mandatory  contributions  that  the  person
would  have  been  required  to  pay  had  that  scheme  been  a
MPFS.

The amount of the deduction cannot exceed the amount specified in Schedule
3B.

FALSE CLAIMS

The wilful submission of an incorrect return or the making of a false
43.
statement  in  connection  with  a  claim  for  any  deduction  or  allowance  by  a
person, renders the person (or any person who has assisted the person to evade
tax)  liable  to  a  fine  on  summary  conviction  at  level  3  (i.e.  $10,000  at  current
level)  and  a  further  fine  of  treble  the  amount  of  tax  which  has  been
undercharged  in  consequence  of  the  offence  or  which  would  have  been
undercharged if the offence had not been detected, and to imprisonment for six
months, and on indictment to a fine at level 5 (i.e. $50,000 at current level) and
a further fine of treble the amount of tax so undercharged or which would have
been so undercharged and to imprisonment for three years.
