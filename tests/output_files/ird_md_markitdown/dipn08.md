INTRODUCTION

Following  the  legislative  amendments  and  a  number  of  court
decisions  concerning  the  treatment  of  losses  in  recent  years,  it  is  considered
appropriate  to  update  our  Practice  Notes  to  incorporate  the  new  statutory
provisions  and  court  cases,  and  to  explain  the  practice  adopted  by  the  Inland
Revenue  Department  in  ascertaining  and  setting  off  the  tax  losses  of
businesses.

STATUTORY PROVISIONS

Section 19C of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (the Ordinance) deals
2.
with the treatment of losses arising from a trade, profession or business for the
year of assessment 1975/76 and subsequent.

Section 19D states that losses are computed in the same way and for
3.
the  same  basis  period  as  assessable  profits  for  that  year  of  assessment  would
have been computed.
It follows, therefore, that the provisions of sections 18B
and  18E  apply  in  deciding the  year  of  assessment  in  which  an  allowable  loss
arises.  Further,  only  losses  arising  in  Hong  Kong  from  the  carrying  on  of  a
trade,  profession  or  business  in  Hong  Kong  are  allowable  for  set  off  against
assessable  profits.  This  is  put  beyond  doubt  by  the  provisions  of  section
19C(6)(d).

Section 18F provides that depreciation allowances under Part VI are
4.
deductible  in  arriving  at  the  amount  of  assessable  profits  of  a  person  “to  the
extent to which the relevant assets are used in the production of the assessable
profits”.
It further provides that where the amount of depreciation allowances
made under Part VI exceeds the person’s assessable profits, as increased by any
balancing  charge,  the  amount  of  such  excess  is  deemed  to  be  a  loss  of  that
person for that year of assessment.

Sections 19CA and 19CB, which apply from the year of assessment
5.
1998/99  onwards,  provide  for  the  set  off  of  unabsorbed  losses  from  normal
trading receipts and concessionary trading receipts.

Section  20AD  stipulates  that  losses  arising  from  the  exempt
6.
transactions carried on by an offshore fund cannot be used to set off against its
to  Departmental
future  assessable  profits.
Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 43 for the operation of the relevant rules.

Reference  can  be  made

TREATMENT OF LOSSES – SECTION 19C

Individuals

7.
Section  19C(1)  provides  that  if  an  individual  sustains  a  loss  in
carrying on a trade, profession or business, such loss can be carried forward for
set  off  against  his  assessable  profits  from  that  same  trade,  etc.,  in  subsequent
years of assessment.  This provision only applies where the individual has not
elected  for  personal  assessment  for  the  year  of  assessment  in  which  the  loss
was incurred.

Partnerships with Individuals as partners

Section  19C(2)  deals  with  the  treatment  of  losses  incurred  by  a
8.
partnership  in  which  one  or  more  of  the  partners  are  individuals.  Any  loss
incurred by such a partnership is apportioned among the partners in accordance
with their profit or loss sharing arrangement during the basis period concerned
(see section 22A).  The amount allocated to a partner who is an individual is
available  for  carry  forward  and  set  off  against  his  share  of  the  partnership
profits from that same business for subsequent years of assessment.  As with
section 19C(1), this provision is also subject to the partner not having elected
personal assessment for that year of assessment.

9.
That  is  to  say,  the  losses  of  a  partnership  are  individual  to  the
partners,  they  are  not  losses  of  the  partnership  and  cannot  be  set  off  against
future partnership profits:

Example 1

A, B and C are carrying on a business in partnership.  A is entitled
to an annual salary of $90,000 and the balance of the profits or loss is
divided equally.

2

The partnership prepares its accounts to 31 December each year and
its results are:

The  loss  of  the  partnership  business  for  the  year  of  assessment
2007/08  (basis  period  –  year  ended  31  December  2007)  is  to  be
allocated among the partners. The loss attributable to each partner is
carried forward and set off against his share of partnership profits for
the year of assessment 2008/09.

If A does not elect for personal assessment for the year of assessment
2008/09, profits tax is payable on the $100,000 profits apportioned to
him  and  a  notice  of  assessment  reflecting  this  will  be  issued  to  the
partnership  in  accordance  with  section  22(1).    If  A  elects  for

3

personal  assessment,  his  total  income  will  include  his  share  of  the
partnership profits of $100,000.

10.
Where  an  individual  has  sustained a loss or has incurred a share of
loss in a partnership and has elected for personal assessment, the amount of the
loss shall be dealt with under personal assessment.

Corporations or bodies of persons

11.
Sections 19C(4) and (5) apply to a corporation or “a person who is
not  an  individual,  a  partnership  or  a  corporation”.    Though  the  definition  of
“person”  in  section  2  includes  a  “trustee”  or  a  “body  of  persons”,  section
19C(6)(e) specifically deals with the treatment of losses sustained by a trustee
(see  paragraph  16  below).  Hence,  sections  19C(4)  and  (5)  are  mainly  for
corporations or bodies of persons.

Section 19C(4) provides that the loss arising from a trade, etc., shall
12.
be set off firstly against the corporation’s or person’s assessable profits for the
same  year  of  assessment.  These  assessable  profits  include  the  corporation’s
or  person’s  share  of  the  assessable  profits  of  any  partnership  of  which  it  is  a
partner.
If the loss is not wholly set off, the balance is carried forward for set
off  against  the  corporation’s  or  person’s  assessable  profits  (including  where
appropriate,  its  share  of  the  assessable  profits  of  any  partnership)  for
subsequent years until fully absorbed.

Section  19C(5)  deals  with  the  situation  in  which  a  corporation  or
13.
person  is  trading  in  a  partnership  and  the  partnership  sustains  a  loss.  The
corporation  or  person  can  set  off  its  share  of  the  partnership  loss  against  its
assessable profits for the same year of assessment.    To the extent that the loss
is not set off, it is carried forward to subsequent years and set off, first against
the  corporation’s  or  person’s  share  of  profits  from  the  partnership  and  then
against  its  own  assessable  profits  for  that  year.  Unlike  section  19C(4),  this
section does not provide for the set off of a corporation’s or person’s share of
loss in a partnership against its share of profits in another partnership.

14.
A  loss  sustained  by  a  corporation  can  be  used  to  set  off  the
corporation’s  share  of  assessable  profits  from  a  partnership  even  though  that
partnership did not exist at the time the corporation incurred the loss.

(1)	  The unabsorbed partnership loss brought forward of $20,000 has to be set off
against A Limited’s share of partnership profits of $100,000 first under section
19C(5).  Therefore,  no  loss  is  available  to  A  Limited  for  set  off  against  the
assessable profits from its own business.

Trustees

Section  19C(6)(e)  deals  with  the  treatment  of  losses  incurred  by  a
16.
trustee who carries on a trade, profession or business in his capacity as a trustee.
Such  losses  are  only  available  for  carry  forward  and  set  off  against  the
assessable  profits  of  the  trust  for  subsequent  years  arising  from  the  particular
trade,  etc.,  in  which  the  losses  were  incurred.    This  provision  makes  it  clear
that  the  losses  of  a  trust  are  not  available  for  set  off  against  the  profits  of
another trust administered by the same trustee; neither are they available for set
off against any profits the trustee may derive in his personal capacity.

6

Personal Assessment

If an individual has elected for personal assessment, section 42(2)(b)
17.
provides  that  his  business  loss  or  share  of  loss  incurred  in  the  year  shall  be
deducted from his total income.  The amount of loss exceeding total income is
to  be  carried  forward  and  set  off  against  the  total  income  for  future  years  of
assessment  until  such  amount  is  wholly  set  off  (see  sections  42(5)(a)(i)
and (b)(i)).

Example 3

During the year of assessment 2008/09, Mr. A, an individual who is
single,  has  both
loss.  Under  personal
assessment, his loss will be set off as follows:

income  and  business

Total income
Business loss
Unabsorbed

loss  carried  forward  under  personal

assessment to the next year of election

$
100,000
(120,000)

20,000

18.
In  the  case  of  a  joint  election  under  section  41(1A),  the  unutilized
current year business loss of an individual is used to set off against the spouse’s
total  income.  Any  excess  business  loss  will  be  carried  forward  to  the  next
year of personal assessment election to set off firstly against the total income of
the individual and then, if still not totally absorbed, against the total income of
the spouse for that year (see sections 42(5)(a)(ii) and (b)(ii)).    Reference can
be made to paragraph 58 and Appendix B of Departmental  Interpretation  and
Practice  Notes  No.  18  for  further  details  of  the  transfer  of  losses  between
spouses in personal assessment.

Limitations on loss relief

19.
Section 19C(6) makes it clear that a loss cannot be set off more than
once and that the total amount set off against assessable profits is not to exceed
the amount of the loss.

7

UNABSORBED  LOSSES  FROM  NORMAL  AND  CONCESSIONARY
TRADING RECEIPTS

Cross set off

Sections 19CA and 19CB provide for the cross set off of unabsorbed
20.
losses from normal trading receipts and concessionary trading receipts.  They
apply  from  the  year  of  assessment  1998/99  onwards.  As  defined  in  section
19CA(5), “concessionary trading receipts” means the trading receipts and other
sums  in  respect  of  which  assessable  profits  are  chargeable  to  tax  at  rate
specified  in  section  14A  (i.e.  qualifying  debt  instruments)  or  14B  (i.e.
qualifying  reinsurance  business  of  an  insurance  corporation),  and  “normal
trading receipts” means the trading receipts and other sums in respect of which
assessable profits are chargeable to tax at the rate specified in Schedule 1 or 8.
For  this  purpose,  profits  or  loss  derived  from  normal  trading  receipts  are
referred  to  as  “normal  profits  or  loss”,  and  profits  or  loss  derived  from
concessionary trading receipts are referred to as “concessionary profits or loss”.

Adjustment factor

21.
As  the  two  streams  of  profits  are  taxed  at  different  rates,  it  is
necessary to apply an adjustment factor to the profits or loss to be set off.    The
adjustment  factor  is  the  ratio,  which  the  normal  and  concessionary  tax  rates
bear to each other.    Thus for the year of assessment 2008/09, the adjustment
factor is 2,
16.5%
8.25%

Same business and same year of assessment – Section 19CA

22.
Section  19CA  deals  with  the  cross  set  off  of  normal  profits  or  loss
and  concessionary  profits  or  loss  within  the  same  year  of  assessment  for  the
same  business.  Section  19CA(2)  applies  when  a  taxpayer  has  unabsorbed
concessionary  loss  and  normal  profits  whilst  section  19CA(3)  applies  when  a
taxpayer  has  unabsorbed  normal  loss  and  concessionary  profits.    The
operation of this section under different scenarios is illustrated in Examples 4

Different business and different year of assessment – Section 19CB

Section  19CB  deals  with  the  set  off  of  profits  or  loss  between
23.
partnerships  and  corporations  and  also  loss  brought  forward  from  previous
years  of  assessment.
  Section  19CB(2)  applies  when  a  taxpayer  has
concessionary loss to be set off against its normal profits whilst section 19CB(3)
applies  when  a  taxpayer  has  a  normal  loss  to  be  set  off  against  its
concessionary  profits.    The  essence  of  this  provision  with  regard  to  the

(1) 	  Section  19CB(3)(b)  applies  as  the  amount  of  normal  loss  brought  forward
exceeds  the  amount  of  concessionary  profits  as  divided  by  the  adjustment
factor (i.e. $10,000 > $18,000 ÷ 2).

(2) 	  The  normal  loss  after  set  off  against  concessionary  profits  shall  be  carried

forward.

(3) 	  The  net  assessable  profits  from   concessionary  trading  receipts  shall  be

deemed to be nil.

Personal assessment is elected – Sections 19C(3A) and 42(1A)

24.
Where personal assessment is elected and the loss or share of loss in
any  year  of  assessment  consists  solely  of  the  balance  of  concessionary  loss
calculated under section 19CA(2)(b), the amount of the loss or the share of loss
to  be  transferred  to  personal  assessment  shall  be  deemed  to  be  the  amount
arrived at by dividing such concessionary loss by the adjustment factor.    For
instance, if personal assessment is elected in Example 5 above, the amount of
concessionary  loss  to  be  deducted  from  the  total  income  of  the  personal
assessment elector under section 42(2)(b) will be $2,000 (i.e. $4,000 ÷ 2).

RIGHTS  OF  OBJECTION  AND  APPEAL  WHERE  LOSSES  ARE
INCURRED

25.
An  objection  to  the  Commissioner  (with  the  subsequent  right  of
appeal  to  the  Board  of  Review  or  the  Court)  only  arises  when  a  person  is
aggrieved  by  an  assessment.    A  computation  of  loss  does  not  state  “the
amount of tax charged, and such due date for payment thereof” as stipulated in
section 62(1), per Yam J in CIR v Yau Lai Man, Agnes trading as L. M. Yau &
Company  6 HKTC 485.    This view was echoed by Deputy Judge To in CIR v
Common Empire Limited  7 HKTC 52 where the learned judge at page 99 said:

“An ascertainment of loss which does not result in the application of
the  appropriate  rate  of  tax  to  that  loss  is  not  an  assessment  within
the meaning of the Ordinance.”

In the Court of Appeal, Rogers VP confirmed this construction as correct.

Accordingly, no right of objection arises unless and until such time

26.
as any loss claimed affects an assessment to tax.    This right arises:

(a) 	 Where the assessor has not agreed a loss claimed to have been
sustained in a year of assessment, and a notice of assessment
has  been  issued  resulting  in  a  liability  to  profits  tax  or
personal tax for that year;

(b)  	 Where  the  assessor  has  issued  a  notice  of  assessment  with  a
liability to profits tax or personal tax for a year of assessment,
which, in the opinion of the taxpayer, fails to set off of a loss
sustained in the preceding year(s).

27.
In  the  case  of  an  unincorporated  business  (whether  a  sole
proprietorship or a partnership), either the sole-proprietor or one or more of the
partners  may  have  elected  for  personal  assessment.    If  the  assessor  disagrees
with a loss claimed under profits tax but does not raise a profits tax assessment,
no  right  of  objection  under  profits  tax  arises  at  the  time.    However,  the
sole-proprietor,  or  any  one  of  the  partners  who  has  elected  for  personal
assessment,  will  be  able  to  object  against  the  personal  assessment  made  on
them if they are aggrieved by the assessment which does not allow the business
loss to be set off, or allows a smaller amount of business loss than that claimed.

14

Where  a  corporation  has  an  interest  in  a  partnership,  either  the
28.
corporation itself or the partnership in which the corporation is a partner may
sustain a loss in a year which can be set off in accordance with sections 19C(4)
and (5).    If the assessor disagrees with the loss claimed and the corporation or
partnership, which is not allowed the benefit of the loss is aggrieved, a right of
objection arises in the following situations:

(a)

The  assessor  computes  the  loss  in  an  amount  less  than  that
claimed:

(i)  	 Where  the  profits  tax  assessment  is  raised  after  the
issue  of  the  computation  of  loss,  within  one  month
after the date of issue of that assessment;

(ii) 	 Where the profits tax assessment was raised before the
issue  of  the  computation  of  loss,  within  one  month
after  the  date  of  issue  of  the  revised  profits  tax
assessment.

(b)

The  assessor  does  not  agree  that  there  is  a  loss  and  issues  a
“Nil” computation of loss:

(i)  	 Where  the  computation  of  loss  issues  prior  to  the
profits tax assessment, within one month after the date
of issue of that assessment;

(ii)  	 Where  the  computation  of  loss  issues  after  the  profits
tax  assessment,  within  one  month  after  the  date  of
issue of that computation.

The  onus  of  lodging  the  notice  of  objection  against  such  an  assessment  rests
with the person on whom the profits tax assessment was raised.
