ASSESSABILITY OF LEASE PREMIUMS

Premiums  on  leases  are  frequently  referred  to  as  non-returnable
deposits,  key  or  tea  money,  construction  fees,  tenancy  rights  or  other  terms.
Sometimes,  taxpayers  or  their  representatives  are  inclined  to  assume  that
receipts of lease premiums or of moneys of a similar nature are capital receipts,
and  consequently  fail  to  show  them  separately  in  their  accounts  or
computations. Such an assumption should not be made, because these receipts,
by virtue of the nature of the trade or business carried on by the recipient, can
often  be,  and  more  frequently  are,  revenue  receipts.  Moreover,  the  fact  that
premium  under  a  lease  or  tenancy  agreement  is  being  regarded  as  capital
expenditure by the payer does not necessarily turn it into a capital receipt in the
hands of the recipient.

By  the  definition  of  “business”  in  section  2  of  the  Inland  Revenue
2.
Ordinance  (the  Ordinance),  corporations  letting  property  are  carrying  on  a
business,  and  so  are  other  persons  sub-letting  property  held  by  them  under  a
lease  other  than  from  the  Government.    Persons  dealing  in  property  are
carrying  on  a  trade.
It  is  therefore  important  that  all  persons  carrying  on  a
property  letting  or  dealing  business  should  give  full  information  concerning
such  receipts  in  their  accounts  supporting  the  tax  returns  filed  with  the
Department.

3.
Taxpayers  or  their  representatives,  if  they  claim  the  captioned
receipts to be capital receipts, have to ascertain and report the precise facts and
the exact legal relationship between the parties occasioned by any agreement to
receive or pay such items.

4.
In a property letting or dealing business, a lease premium is part of a
payment  for  the  use  of  the  property  and  therefore  is  an  income  of  a  revenue
nature.  This  view  is  supported  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  decision  in  the  East
African  Tax  Case  No.  37  -  A.L.  et  al  v.  The  Commissioner  of  Income  Tax
[E.A.T.C. Vol. 2 at page 148] which held that the premiums in that case were
received for the use of a capital asset and not for its realization and that they
were therefore income receipts and taxable.

5.
of Vol. 24, expressed a similar view –

The editors of Halsbury’s Laws of Hong Kong, at paragraph 370.174

“Where  a  person  dealing  in  land  may  be  considered  carrying  on  a
business  (and  therefore  subject  to  profits  tax),  the  receipt  of  rent,
lease  premiums,  construction  fees  and  other  miscellaneous  sums
arising  from  dealings  with  land  should  also  be  included  as  trading
receipts irrespective of the possible capital nature from the viewpoint
of the payee.”

Generally  accepted  accounting  practice 1   requires  that  premium
6.
receipts  be  spread  over  the  term  of  the  lease  for  the  purpose  of  recognizing
them  as  income.    If  the  accounts  are  prepared  on  such  basis,  the  premium
receipts will be assessed to profits tax accordingly.

INTERACTION WITH PROPERTY TAX

7.
Under  section  5B(4)  of  the  Ordinance,  a  lease  premium  is  deemed
for property tax purposes to be payable in equal monthly instalments during the
period  of  the  right  of  use  of  the  property  subject  to  a  maximum  period  of  3
years.  Accordingly,  property  tax  may  be  charged  on  such  a  basis.
Nevertheless, any property tax so paid is available for set-off against the profits
tax  payable  by  the  owner  of  the  property  under  section  25  of  the  Ordinance.
Any excess property tax paid will be refunded.  Furthermore, where the owner
is a corporation, the exemption from property tax provided under section 5(2)(a)
may also be available.

EXAMPLES

8.
and 7 above.

The  following  examples  illustrate  the  operation  of  paragraphs  6

Example 1

Company  H  carries  on  a  property  letting  business.    While  retaining
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to its ownership, it leases one
of  its  properties  for  a  term  of  2  years  at  a  premium  of  $1,200,000.  Assume
that it closes its accounts on 31 March each year.

1  Hong Kong Accounting Standard 17 – Leases, issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public
Accountants.

2

According  to  Hong  Kong  Accounting  Standard  17  (paragraphs  4  and  8),  the
lease  will  be  an  operating  lease  and  hence  the  lease  premium  “shall  be
recognised  in  income  on  a  straight  line  basis  over  the  lease  term”  (paragraph
50),  i.e.  over  the  2-year  period.  Therefore,  half  of  the  premium  will  be
assessed to profits tax in Year 1 and half in Year 2.

Property  tax  assessments  may  be  issued to  Company H.    Pursuant to section
5B(4), half of the premium will be charged to property tax in Year 1 and half in
Year  2.  Company  H  is  entitled  to  set  off  the  property  taxes  paid  against  its
profits  taxes  payable  on  the  premium  for  these  2  years  and  have  the  balance
refunded, if any (section 25).

Alternatively, Company H can apply for property tax exemption under section
5(2)(a) of the Ordinance, leaving the premium to be assessed to profits tax.

Example 2

Same scenario as in Example 1 except that the lease is for a term of 6 years.

According  to  Hong  Kong  Accounting  Standard  17  (paragraph  50),  the  lease
premium will be recognised in income on a straight line basis over the 6-year
period.  Therefore,  1/6  of  the  premium  (or  $200,000)  will  be  assessed  to
profits tax in each of the years from Year 1 to Year 6.

Property  tax  assessments  may  be  issued to  Company H.    Pursuant to section
5B(4),  the  premium  will  be  deemed  to  be  payable  and  hence  assessed  over  a
maximum period of 3 years.  Hence, 1/3 of the premium (or $400,000) will be
charged to property tax in each of the Years 1, 2 and 3.    Company H is entitled
to  set  off  the  property  taxes  paid  against  its  profits  taxes  payable  for  these  3
years  respectively  and  have  the  balance  refunded,  if  any  (section  25).  No
question of set-off/refund will arise starting from Year 4.
