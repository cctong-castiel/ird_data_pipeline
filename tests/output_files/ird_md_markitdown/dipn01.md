PART A: COMPUTING ASSESSABLE PROFITS

BASIS FOR COMPUTING ASSESSABLE PROFITS

Profits arisen or derived

Profits  tax  is  charged  under  section  14  of  the  Inland  Revenue
Ordinance  (the  Ordinance)  on  a  person  carrying  on  a  trade,  profession  or
business in Hong Kong in respect of the person’s assessable profits arising in or
derived from Hong Kong from such trade, profession or business.    Section 2
defines “assessable profits” to mean the profits in respect of which a person is
chargeable to tax for the basis period for any year of assessment.

Full amount of profits

Section  18B(1)  provides  that  the  assessable  profits  for  any  year  of
2.
assessment from any trade, profession or business carried on in Hong Kong shall
be computed on the full amount of the profits arising in or derived from Hong
Kong during the year of assessment.    The full amount of the profits arisen or
derived during the year of assessment is determined in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles subject to the requirement of conformity with the
tax laws (i.e. the Ordinance and the relevant judicial interpretations).    In CIR v
Secan Ltd & Another (2000) 3 HKCFAR 411, Lord Millett NPJ said at page 419
that  losses,  of  course,  are  merely  the  mirror  image  of  profits,  and  must  be
ascertained for tax purposes in the like manner.    Further, section 19D provides
that the amount of loss incurred by a person shall be computed in like manner
and for such basis period as assessable profits would have been computed.

Accounting period as basis period

3.
Section 18B(2) allows a person to choose an accounting period that
ends on a day within a year of assessment as the basis period for that year.    If
the financial statements are drawn up to 31 March annually, the basis period for
the year of assessment 2019/20 will be the accounting year ended 31 March 2020.
If the financial statements are drawn up to 30 June annually, the basis period for
the year of assessment 2019/20 will be the accounting year ended 30 June 2019.
If  the  financial  statements  are  drawn  up  to  31  December  annually,  the  basis

period for the year of assessment 2019/20 will be the accounting year ended 31
December 2019.

Deductible expenses

Profits  of  a  person  cannot  be  ascertained  without  considering
4.
deduction of outgoings and expenses.    If an expense is a proper deduction in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the expense should be
allowed  unless  the  expense  is  prohibited  for  deduction  under  the  Ordinance.
The  concept  of  “profits”  needs  the  making  of  such  deductions  as  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  would  require:  see  Usher’s  Wiltshire  Brewery
Ltd v Bruce [1914] 6 TC 399, Atherton v British Insulated and Helsby Cables
Ltd [1925] 10 TC 155, and Morley v Lawford [1928] 14 TC 229.

5.
Section  16  governs  the  deduction  of  outgoings  and  expenses  while
section 17 disallows certain deductions.    In CIR v Secan Ltd & Another (2000)
3 HKCFAR 411, Lord Millett NPJ said that sections 16 and 17 are enacted for
the protection of the revenue, not the taxpayer, and section 16 is to be read in a
negative sense.    Section 16 permits outgoings and expenses to be deducted only
to the extent to which they are incurred in a year of assessment.    If accounting
profits, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
have taken into account expenses that are not deductible under the Ordinance,
those expenses are to be excluded for tax purposes in order to conform with the
Ordinance.

RELEVANCE OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

Accrual accounting

For  profits  tax  purposes,  the  application  of  generally  accepted
6.
accounting principles to the transactions of the trade or business is the starting
point  for  computing  assessable  profits.    In  general,  financial  statements
prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  will
provide the practical basis for computing assessable profits.

Since accrual accounting is the fundamental concept which underpins
7.
the  preparation  of  financial  statements,  revenue  and  expenses  are  recognised

2

even if receipts and payments occur in a different period.    The point at which
revenue is recognised is usually the same point at which any related expenses are
recognised.

8.
In  buying  and  selling  of  goods,  the  cost  of  the  purchases  is  usually
carried as inventories in the statement of financial position until such time as the
inventories are sold and the related revenue is recognised.    Inventories are then
recognised as cost of sales and thus an expense.

9.
Revenue  is  derived  or  earned  when  goods  are  sold  or  services  are
provided (i.e. promised goods or services are transferred) and is measured at the
amount  of  consideration  a  person  expects  to  be  entitled  in  exchange  for
transferring promised goods or services.    Accordingly, when sales are made in
an accounting period, the sale price should normally be brought into account for
profits tax purposes in that period even if the proceeds are not received until after
the end of the period subject to a possible provision for bad debts.

10.
The Commissioner normally does not accept cash basis since profits
from  trading  or  business  are  recognised  on  an  accrual  basis.    Thus,  profits
recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles are normally taken as profits “arisen” or “derived” for the purposes of
section 14 provided that the accrual is not “anticipatory” but made to reflect the
existence of a contract of sale.

Interaction between accountancy and tax laws

11.
While  profits  computed  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles form the starting point for the computation of assessable
profits, adjustments to those profits may need to be made to conform with tax
laws (i.e. the Ordinance and the relevant judicial interpretations).    Adjustments
may also be needed to give effect to more general tax principles (e.g. profits of
a capital nature) to tax the full amount of the profits of the trade, profession or
business.

12.
The courts in the United Kingdom have been increasingly reluctant to
override generally accepted accounting principles: see the judgments in Threlfall
v Jones [1993] 66 TC 77, Johnston v Britannia Airways Ltd [1994] 67 TC 99
and,  specifically  on  the  timing  of  receipts,  Symons  v  Lord  Llewelyn-Davies’

3

Personal Representative and Others [1982] 56 TC 630.    In particular, they have
been especially unready to override accounting treatment, which in commercial
terms is the only acceptable treatment: see the observations of the Master of the
Rolls in Threlfall v Jones at page 123.

The Court of Final Appeal’s judgment in CIR v Secan Ltd & Another
13.
(2000) 3 HKCFAR 411 is the highest authority in Hong Kong on the relevance
of commercial accounting principles in ascertaining profits for the purposes of
section 14.    Lord Millett NPJ held that profits and losses must be ascertained in
accordance with the ordinary principles of commercial accounting as modified
to conform with the Ordinance.    Where the financial statements of a person are
correctly drawn in accordance with such principles and in conformity with the
Ordinance, no further modifications are required or permitted.

In the United Kingdom, this principle was reaffirmed by the House of
14.
Lords  in  Revenue  and  Customs  Commissioners  v  William  Grant  &  Sons
Distillers Ltd [2007] 1 WLR 1448 at page 1458 per Lord Hope of Craighead who
also adopted Sir Thomas Bingham MR’s observation in Gallagher v Jones [1994]
Ch 107 that the principles of commercial accountancy are not static but so long
as they remain current and generally accepted, they provide the surest guide to
the question that the legislation requires to be answered.

Application of accounting principles

15.
assessable profits, their application is subject to several considerations:

Whilst  accounting  principles  are  relevant  to  the  ascertainment  of

(a)

the court will have recourse to the evidence of accountants in
determining  what  the  correct  principles  of  commercial
accounting are and has to make a final decision as to whether
such  practice  corresponds  to  the  correct  principles  of
commercial  accountancy,  as  there  may  be  a  divergence  of
views  between  accountants  or  there  may  be  alternative
principles1;

(b)

the court will always have the last word though great weight

1  See Odeon Associated Theatres Ltd v Jones 48 TC 257 at 273.

4

would  be  attached  to  the  view  of  the  accounting  profession2
and  the  court  would  not  regard  itself  as  being  bound  by  the
evidence of accountants as it would be wrong to do so3;

(c)

the principles of commercial accountancy must yield not only
to statutory provisions, but also to any overriding principle of
tax law4.

Two cardinal principles

16.
In Nice Cheer Investment Ltd v CIR (2013) 16 HKCFAR 813, Lord
Millett NPJ at the Court of Final Appeal clarified the expression “in conformity
with the Ordinance” and elaborated what constitutes taxable profits within the
meaning  of  the  Ordinance.    Lord  Millett  NPJ  said  there  are  two  cardinal
principles of tax law: “profits” connotes actual or realised and not potential or
anticipated profits; and neither profits nor losses may be anticipated5.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards

For  the  purposes  of  computing  the  full  amount  of  profits  arisen  or
17.
derived  in  the  basis  period  for  a  year  of  assessment,  the  relevant  generally
accepted accounting principles can be found in Hong Kong Financial Reporting
Standards  (HKFRS),  including  both  Standards  (i.e.  HKFRS  and  Hong  Kong
Accounting  Standards  (HKAS))  and  Interpretations  (i.e.  Hong  Kong  (IFRIC)
(SIC)
Interpretations,  Hong  Kong
Interpretations),  published  by  the  Hong  Kong  Institute  of  Certified  Public
Accountants (HKICPA).

Interpretations  and  Hong  Kong

2  Ostime v Duple Motor Bodies Ltd [1961] 39 TC 537, per Lord Reid at 570.
3  Heather v P-E Consulting Group Ltd [1973] Ch 189, per Lord Denning at 217.
4  Willingale v International Commercial Bank Ltd [1977] Ch 78 at 97.
5  In the Nice Cheer case, the unrealised gains related to fair value changes of securities which were held
for  trading.    Such  gains  are  currently  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  HKFRS  9  Financial
Instruments and do not relate to any contract or transaction with a customer as defined under HKFRS
15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (see Part B of this Practice Note).    As a rule of practice,
revenue recognised under HKFRS 15 upon transfer of goods or services is generally treated as having
been realised and would be assessed as profits having been derived.

5

For small and medium-sized entities and private entities, the relevant
18.
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  can  be  found  in  Small  and  Medium-
Sized Entity Financial Reporting Framework and Financial Reporting Standard
(SME-FRF  &  SME-FRS)  and  Hong  Kong  Financial  Reporting  Standard  for
Private Entities (HKFRS for Private Entities).

19.
HKFRS determine generally accepted accounting principles in Hong
Kong  and  set  out  recognition,  measurement,  presentation  and  disclosure
requirements dealing with transactions and events that are important in general
purpose financial statements.    HKFRS are based on the Conceptual Framework
for  Financial  Reporting,  which  addresses  the  concepts  underlying  the
information presented in general purpose financial statements.

New or revised standards

20.
From  time  to  time,  new  or  revised  standards  will  be  developed  to
address new and changing transactions and events, or improve the standards by
removing  options,  developing  better  treatments  and  addressing  issues  more
specifically.    A  new  or  revised  standard  will  determine  generally  accepted
accounting principles in Hong Kong from the date the new or revised standard
becomes effective.

HKFRS applicable to Hong Kong incorporated companies

21.
Companies incorporated in Hong Kong are required under Part 9 of
the  Companies  Ordinance  (Cap.  622)  to  prepare  annual  financial  statements
which  are  in  compliance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.
Section  380(4)(b)  of  the  Companies  Ordinance  requires  that  the  financial
statements  of  a  financial  year  must  comply  with  the  accounting  standards
applicable  to  the  financial  statements.    A  company  which  prepares  financial
statements  in  compliance  with  HKFRS  is  required  to  make  an  explicit  and
unreserved statement of such compliance in the notes to the financial statements.
Where a company, in an extremely rare circumstance, concludes that compliance
with a requirement in an HKFRS would be so misleading that it would conflict
with the objective of financial statements set out in the Conceptual Framework
for  Financial  Reporting,  the  company  may  depart  from  that  requirement  by
making necessary disclosures.

6

Standards applicable to non-Hong Kong incorporated companies

For companies incorporated outside Hong Kong, including branches,
22.
which  carry  on  business  in  Hong  Kong,  their  financial  statements  may  be
prepared in accordance with financial reporting standards which vary from those
in Hong Kong (e.g. HKFRS).    The Commissioner would generally accept an
accounting treatment which is in accordance with the relevant financial reporting
standard  of  the  “home”  jurisdiction  or  International  Financial  Reporting
Standards  issued  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board,  and  is
consistent  with  the  true  facts  or  otherwise  apt  to  determine  the  true  profits  or
losses of the business.    Though the financial reporting standards of the “home”
jurisdiction  may  be  accepted  for  determining  the  accounting  profits  or  losses,
such profits or losses would be subject to the requirement of conformity with the
tax laws.

Financial statements required to give a true and fair view

23.
The requirement for the assessable profits of a trade or business to be
computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles does not,
in  itself,  impose  any  audit  requirement.    Companies  formed  and  registered
under the Companies Ordinance, however, must have their financial statements
audited  unless  they  are  dormant.    A  company  must  keep  such  accounting
records  as  will  enable  its  directors  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the
Companies Ordinance.

The  auditor’s  report,  where  required,  must  state  whether  in  the
24.
auditor’s  opinion  the  financial  statements  have  been  properly  prepared  in
compliance with the Companies Ordinance and give a true and fair view of the
financial performance and financial position of the company if the company does
not fall within the reporting exemption for the financial year.    If the financial
statements  do  not  represent  a  true  and  fair  view,  the  auditor  must  qualify  the
report  accordingly.    In  practice,  the  application  of  the  principal  qualitative
characteristics under the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting and of
appropriate accounting standards (i.e. HKFRS and HKFRS for Private Entities),
with  additional  disclosure  when  necessary,  normally  results  in  financial
statements that give what is generally understood as a true and fair view of, or as
presenting fairly such information.

7

Private companies or companies limited by guarantee which qualify
25.
for reporting exemption under section 359 of the Companies Ordinance and take
advantage of the reporting exemption are exempt from the requirement for their
financial statements to give a true and fair view.    Instead of preparing financial
statements under the fair presentation framework, companies taking advantage
of the reporting exemption are required to prepare their financial statements in
accordance with SME-FRF & SME-FRS as these are the applicable accounting
standards  for  such  companies  for  the  purposes  of  complying  with  section
380(4)(b) of the Companies Ordinance.

Profits tax return

26.
When submitting a profits tax return, a company must attach certified
copies  of  its  audited  financial  statements  if  required  by  the  Board  of  Inland
Revenue.    Without the audited financial statements, the profits tax return will
not  be  accepted  as  being  complete  and  the  company  will  not  be  accepted  as
having complied with the filing obligation under the Ordinance.    The company
may  be  subject  to  penal  action  if  the  audited  financial  statements  cannot  be
submitted before the filing deadline.    An estimated assessment may be raised
on the company if the company is considered to be chargeable to profits tax.

PART B: REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

Objective of HKFRS 15

HKFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers6  was issued to
27.
replace  a  number  of  Standards  and  Interpretations 7.    The  objective  of  this
standard is to establish the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful
information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer.
It provides comprehensive guidance to be applied in order to recognise revenue
from contracts with customers.    It considers goods and services provided in a
contract to be performance obligations that must be satisfied before revenue can
be recognised.    It was issued with an effective date of 1 January 2017 which
was later revised to 1 January 2018.

28.
While appropriate adjustments are still required to be made for profits
tax purposes, the introduction of HKFRS 15 has brought in certainty and clarity
regarding the recognition of profits for both accounting and profits tax purposes.
Under HKFRS 15, revenue is recognised when performance obligations of the
contract  are  satisfied  (i.e.  when  control  of  the  goods  or  services  has  been
transferred to the customer).    In contrast, profits tax is charged when the profit
is derived and the expense is incurred.    In practice, the difference, if any, should
not be significant since the five-step approach under HKFRS 15 means that the
accounting treatment follows a substance-based approach which is based on the
transfer of control of the goods or services.    Appendix 1 gives an overview of
HKFRS 15.

6  HKFRS 15 does not apply to revenue arising from the following:

(a)
(b)
(c)

lease contracts within the scope of HKFRS 16 Leases;
insurance contracts within the scope of HKFRS 4 Insurance Contracts;
financial instruments and other contractual rights or obligations within the scope of HKFRS 9
Financial  Instruments,  HKFRS  10  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  HKFRS  11  Joint
Arrangements, HKAS 27 Separate Financial Statements and HKAS 28 Investment in Associates
and Joint Ventures; and

(d)  non-monetary  exchanges  between  entities  in  the  same  line  of  business  to  facilitate  sales  to

customers or potential customers.

7   HKAS  11  Construction  Contracts,  HKAS  18  Revenue,  HK(IFRIC)-Int  13  Customer  Loyalty
Programmes, HK(IFRIC)-Int 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, HK(IFRIC)-Int 18
Transfer  of  Assets  from  Customers  and  HK(SIC)-Int  31  Revenue—Barter  Transactions  Involving
Advertising Services.

9

Five-step revenue recognition model under HKFRS 15

The core principle of HKFRS 15 is that an entity recognises revenue
29.
to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that  reflects  the  consideration  to  which  the  entity  expects  to  be  entitled  in
exchange  for  those  goods  or  services.    An  entity  recognises  revenue  in
accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps:

(a)

Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer;

(b)

Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract;

(c)

Step 3: Determine the transaction price;

(d)

(e)

Step  4:  Allocate  the  transaction  price  to  the  performance
obligations in the contract; and

Step  5:  Recognise  revenue  when  (or  as)  the  entity  satisfies  a
performance obligation.

A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable
rights and obligations.    A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with
a customer to transfer to the customer either  a good or service or a  bundle of
goods or services that is distinct, or a series of distinct goods or services that are
substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.
When  an  entity  transfers  promised  goods  or  services  to  a  customer,  the
transaction price is the amount of consideration in a contract to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer.

30.
Regarding  construction  contracts,  and  pre-completion  sale  and
purchase  agreements  for  units  in  multi-storey  residential  buildings,  the
application of the revenue recognition principles under HKFRS 15 is explained
in Appendices 2 and 3.    Small and medium-sized entities and private entities,
which fulfill the criteria for reporting under SME-FRF & SME-FRS and HKFRS
for Private Entities, should recognise revenue from such contracts or agreements
in accordance with:

(a)

section 8 (Construction Contracts) or section 11 (Revenue) of
SME-FRF & SME-FRS; or

10

(b)

section 23 (Revenue) of HKFRS for Private Entities.

Performance obligation satisfied over time or at a point in time

31.
Under HKFRS 15, revenue should be recognised when performance
obligation is satisfied (i.e. control of the promised good or service of a contract
is obtained by the customer).    The customer has control of the promised good
or  service  when  the  customer  has  the  ability  to  direct  the  use  of,  and  obtain
substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the good or service by the use,
consumption, sale or exchange, pledging and holding of the good or service.    In
practice, if a person has recognised a revenue under Step 5, the Commissioner
would  regard  the  revenue  as  having  been  realised  (i.e.  the  revenue  is  not
anticipated) and such revenue should be included as the assessable profits of the
person.

32.
At contract inception, it has to be determined whether the performance
obligation  is  satisfied  over  time  or  at  a  point  in  time  in  accordance  with
paragraphs  35  to  38  of  HKFRS  15.    If  the  performance  obligation  is  not
satisfied  over  time,  it  is  satisfied  at  a  point  in  time.    For  the  purposes  of
determining the point in time at which a customer obtains control of the good or
service, the indicators of the transfer of control taken into account should include,
but not limited to, the following:

(a)

the person has a present right to payment for the good or service;

(b)

the customer has legal title to the good or service;

(c)

(d)

the person has transferred physical possession of the good or
service;

the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership
of the good or service; and

(e)

the customer has accepted the good or service.

The indicators are usually present if the customer has the control of the good or
service.    However,  the  indicators  are  not  individually  determinative  and  they
are not a list of conditions that have to be met.    The nature of the good or service

11

in  question  and  the  terms  of  the  contract  would  generally  determine  which
indicators of the transfer of the control would be of relevance.

HKFRS 15 for computing assessable profits

When applying HKFRS 15, the terms of the contract entered into with

33.
the  customer  and  all  relevant  facts  and  circumstances  have  to  be  considered.
Given  HKFRS  15  provides  the  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  for
recognition of revenue, the Commissioner would accept that accounting profits
determined  in  accordance  with  HKFRS  15  would  form  the  starting  point  for
computing  assessable  profits.    The  examples  in  this  Practice  Note  are  not
intended to comprehensively address all possible tax issues that may arise.    It
should not be assumed that the examples will provide a definite answer in every
case.    Each  example  addresses  the  tax  issues  in  relation  to  the  specific  facts
given.

Example 1

Company-HK developed a new computer equipment which would not
function  or  be  sold  without  an  operating  software.    On  1  January
2019, Company-HK entered into a contract with a customer for selling
the computer equipment for $4,000,000.    The contract with two-year
maintenance  services,  which  covered  parts,  labour  and  software
repairs, would commence upon delivery of the computer equipment.
On  1  February  2019,  the  computer  equipment  was  delivered  to  the
customer.    Company-HK  determined  that  the  stand-alone  selling
prices  at  contract  inception  were:  $3,500,000  for  the  computer
equipment and the operating software (as a bundle); and $500,000 for
the maintenance services.    Company-HK closed its accounts on 31
December annually.

The  five-step  revenue  recognition  model  under  HKFRS  15  would
need to be applied as follows:

Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer

(a)

Company-HK  would  be  required  to  account  for  the  contract
since the five criteria in paragraph 9 of HKFRS 15 are met (i.e.

contract  approved  and  performance  obligations  committed;
rights  regarding  the  equipment  and  services  identified;
payment  terms  for  the  equipment  and  services  identified;
commercial  substance  found;  and  consideration  entitled
collectable).

Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract

(b)

In the sale contract, there were two performance obligations:
transfer of the computer equipment and operating software; and
provision  of  two-year  maintenance  services.    Since  benefits
could  not  be  obtained  from  the  computer  equipment  without
the operating software, the computer equipment and operating
software  were  not  distinct  goods  and  the  promises  regarding
their  transfer  could  not  be  treated  as  separate  performance
obligations.

Step 3: Determine the transaction price

(c)

Transaction price of $4,000,000 fixed in the sale contract was
the  consideration  that  Company-HK  would  expect  to  be
entitled to in exchange for transferring the computer equipment
and  operating  software,  and  the  maintenance  services  to  the
customer.

Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract

(d)

$4,000,000  should  be  allocated  to  each  of  the  performance
obligations  in  the  contract  based  on  the  relative  stand-alone
selling price.    $3,500,000 and $500,000 should be allocated to
the  computer  equipment  and  operating  software,  and  the
maintenance services respectively.

Step  5:  Recognise  revenue  when  or  as  the  performance  obligations
are satisfied

(e)

Revenue  from  the  sale  of  the  computer  equipment  and

13

operating software should be recognised at a point in time since
none  of  the  criteria  in  paragraph  35  of  HKFRS  15  was  met.
Revenue  of  $3,500,000  should  be  recognised  in  Company-
HK’s  accounts  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2019  upon
delivery.
  Revenue  from  the  provision  of  maintenance
services  should  be  recognised  over  time  since  the  customer
would  consume  and  receive  benefit  from  the  maintenance
services  over  a  two-year  period  (i.e.  1  February  2019  to  31
January 2021).    Revenue of $500,000 would be recognised in
Company-HK’s  accounts  for  the  years  ended  31  December
2019, 2020 and 2021 using an appropriate basis for measuring
progress towards completion of the maintenance services.

For  profits  tax  purposes,  the  revenue  as  recognised  in  the
accounting  periods  for  the  years  ended  31  December  2019,
2020  and  2021  would  be  regarded  as  having  arisen  or  been
derived under section 18B in the years of assessment 2019/20,
2020/21 and 2021/22 respectively.    Expenses, which satisfied
the deduction rules under sections 16 and 17 and were incurred
in  the  production  of  the  revenue  for  the  years  ended  31
December 2019, 2020 and 2021, would be matched against the
revenue to arrive at the assessable profits of Company-HK for
the years of assessment 2019/20, 2020/21 and 2021/22.

Variable consideration

34.
Where a contract includes variable consideration (e.g. price discounts,
rebates, incentives and performance bonuses), a person has to recognise variable
consideration  as  revenue  only  to  the  extent  that  it  is  highly  probable  that  a
significant  reversal  in  the  amount  of  cumulative  revenue  recognised  will  not
occur when the uncertainty related to the variable consideration is subsequently
resolved.    For profits tax purposes, the Commissioner takes the view that the
variable  consideration  recognised  as  revenue  in  such  a  situation  would  be
regarded  as  having  been  realised  and  the  resulting  profits  after  deduction  of
expenses would be assessed accordingly.

14

Example 2

Bank-HK entered into  a contract to help a customer  with an equity
placement.    Bank-HK  determined  at  contract  inception  that  the
performance  obligation  would  be  satisfied  at  a  point  in  time  upon
completion of the equity placement.    In addition to a fixed fee of $10
million, Bank-HK would receive a bonus of $1 million if the placement
was  successful.    Bank-HK  determined  that  the  most  likely  amount
provided the best estimation of the amount of consideration to which
it  would  be  entitled  though  there  would  be  a  75%  chance  that  the
placement  would  be  successful  and  a  25%  chance  that  it  would  be
unsuccessful.

If the most likely amount was adopted, the variable consideration that
Bank-HK expected to be entitled to would be $1 million.    Since the
payment  of  the  bonus  was  highly  susceptible  to  market  volatility,
which was outside the control of Bank-HK and the customer, it would
be concluded that the variable consideration should be constrained to
zero  until  the  equity  placement  was  completed.    For  profits  tax
purposes, the variable consideration of $1 million would be regarded
as having been realised when the equity placement was completed (i.e.
tax treatment and accounting treatment of the variable consideration
are the same).

Significant financing component

35.
Where the timing of payment agreed in the contract provides a person
or the person’s customer with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of
the  good  or  service,  an  adjustment  of  the  compromised  consideration  for  the
effects of the time value of money is required and the effects of financing (i.e.
interest revenue or interest expense) are presented separately from revenue from
contracts with customers.

Though notional interest revenue or interest expense are recognised in
36.
the financial statements in accordance with HKFRS 15, there is no actual interest
receipt  or  interest  payment.    A  person  receiving  advance  payments  from  a
customer has no obligation or accrued liability to pay interest to the customer
whereas a person receiving deferred payments from a customer does not have

15

any  right,  legal  or  contractual,  to  receive  interest  from  the  customer.    The
Commissioner  therefore takes the  view  that  such interest revenue and interest
expense are notional constructs made solely for complying with the accounting
requirements of HKFRS 15 and should not be brought to tax.

37.

For profits tax purposes:

(a)

(b)

any  sum  recognised  as  notional  interest  revenue  as  required
under HKFRS 15 for deferred payments made by a customer
should be recognised as part of the revenue derived from sale
of the good or service in the year of assessment in which the
good or service is transferred to the customer;

any  sum  recognised  as  notional  interest  expense  as  required
under HKFRS 15 for advance payments made by a customer
should be ignored and the cash payment received upfront (i.e.
without any notional interest expense) should be recognised as
revenue derived from sale of the good or service in the year of
assessment  in  which  the  good  or  service  is  transferred  to  the
customer.

In  the  tax  computations,  tax  adjustments  relating  to  significant  financing
components have to be made and clearly disclosed.

Example 3

On 1 January 2018, Company-HK sold Product A to a customer with
delivery  on  that  same  day.    It  was  agreed  in  the  contract  that  the
price of $500,000 would be deferred for payment until 31 December
2019.    The  incremental  borrowing  rate  of  Company-HK  was  5%.
Company-HK closed its accounts on 31 December each year.    Given
that  the  contract  contained  a  significant  financing  component,
Company-HK  accounted  for  the  revenue  and  significant  financing
component in accordance with HKFRS 15 as follows:

16

Account

Debit
$

Credit
$

Year ended 31 December 2018
To recognise revenue upon delivery of Product A:

Receivable

453,514

Revenue ($500,000  ÷  1.052)

453,514

To recognise interest revenue:

Receivable

22,676

Interest revenue ($453,514  ×  5%)

22,676

Year ended 31 December 2019
To recognise interest revenue:

Interest revenue ($476,190  ×  5%)

23,810

To recognise receipt of payment:

Bank

Receivable

500,000

500,000

Though $46,486 (i.e. $22,676 + $23,810), which formed part of the
sale price, was recognised as notional interest revenue in accordance
with the requirement under HKFRS 15, Company-HK had no right to
receive  any  interest  from  the  customer.    $500,000  (i.e.  $453,514  +
$22,676  +  $23,810)  should  be  recognised  as  revenue  in  the  year  of
assessment 2018/19 since control of Product A was obtained by  the
customer  upon  delivery  on  1  January  2018.    $22,676  and  $23,810
should not be assessed as interest revenue for the years of assessment
2018/19 and 2019/20.

In the tax computation for the year of assessment 2018/19, Company-
HK should declare revenue of $500,000 as having been derived from
sale  of  Product  A  and  disregard  the  notional  interest  revenue  of
$22,676.    In the tax computation for the year of assessment 2019/20,
Company-HK should disregard the interest revenue of $23,810.

17

Example 4

On 1 January 2018, Company-HK sold  Product B to a customer at
$500,000 and an upfront payment was made by the customer.    It was
agreed  in  the  contract  that  Product  B  would  be  delivered  to  the
customer on 31 December 2019.    The incremental borrowing rate of
Company-HK  was  5%.    Company-HK  closed  its  accounts  on  31
December each year.    Given that the contract contained a significant
financing  component,  Company-HK  accounted  for  the  revenue  and
significant  financing  component  in  accordance  with  HKFRS  15  as
follows:

To recognise revenue upon delivery of Product B:

Though $51,250 (i.e. $25,000 + $26,250) was recognised as notional
interest expense in accordance with the requirement under HKFRS 15,
Company-HK  had  no  legal  obligation  to  pay  any  interest  to  the
customer  and  such  notional  interest  expense  should  be  ignored  for
profits  tax  purposes.    Since  Product  B  was  transferred  to  the
customer  upon  delivery  on  31  December  2019,  $500,000  (i.e.

18

$551,250–$25,000–$26,250)  should  be  recognised  as  revenue  in
the year of assessment 2019/20.

In the tax computation for the year of assessment 2018/19, Company-
HK should add back the notional interest expense of $25,000.    In the
tax  computation  for  the  year  of  assessment  2019/20,  Company-HK
should add back the notional interest expense of $26,250 and declare
revenue of $500,000 as having been derived from sale of Product B.

Transitional adjustments

HKFRS 15 prescribes the transitional accounting adjustments when a
38.
person first applies the standard.    HKFRS 15 is allowed to be adopted by using
one of the following two methods:

(a)

(b)

retrospectively  to  each  prior  reporting  period  presented  in
accordance  with  HKAS  8  Accounting  Policies,  Changes  in
Accounting  Estimates  and  Errors  (i.e.  full  retrospective
method); or

retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying
HKFRS  15  recognised  at  the  date  of  initial  application  (i.e.
modified retrospective method).

Regardless  of  the  method  adopted,  the  Commissioner  takes  the  view  that  any
upward transitional adjustment that is revenue in nature should be subject to tax
and  any  downward  transitional  adjustment  that  is  revenue  in  nature  would  be
deducted from the profits or allowed as a deduction, as the case may be, in the
year of assessment relating to the basis period in which HKFRS 15 was adopted
for the first time.

Example 5

Company-HK,  a  software  company,  entered  into  a  contract  with  a
customer to provide a software term licence and telephone support for
two years at a fixed price of $4,000.    The software was delivered and
operational on 1 July 2016.    Company-HK recognised revenue in its
accounts  for  the  years  ended  31  December  2016  and  2017  on  a

19

straight-line basis:

Year ended 31 December

Revenue

2016
$
1,000

2017
$
2,000

Total
$
3,000

Revenue assessed was: $1,000 for the year of assessment 2016/17; and
$2,000 for the year of assessment 2017/18.

Company-HK  adopted  HKFRS  15  on  1  January  2018.    It  allocated
$3,000  and  $1,000  to  the  two  performance  obligations,  the  software
licence and telephone support respectively, based on the relative stand-
alone  selling  prices.    Company-HK  determined  that  the  software
licence  was  a  point-in-time  performance  obligation  whereas  the
telephone  support  was  a  performance  obligation  satisfied  over  time.
Under HKFRS 15, revenue from software licence should be recognised
on the delivery date of 1 July 2016 and revenue from telephone support
should be recognised by reference to the progress which was measured
by time lapse (2016: $250; 2017: $500; 2018: $250).

Scenario 1: Company-HK applied the transition provisions of HKFRS
15 using the full retrospective method.    The financial statements for
the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2017 were restated as below:

Year ended 31 December

Revenue

2016
$
3,250

2017
$
500

2018
$

Total
$

Under the full retrospective method, revenue restated was: $3,250 for
the  year  ended  31  December  2016;  and  $500  for  the  year  ended  31
December  2017.    The  adjustment  of  $750  (i.e.  $3,250  +  $500 –
$3,000) formed part of the contract revenue and would be assessed in
the  year of assessment 2018/19 relating to the basis period in which
HKFRS  15  was  first  adopted  by  Company-HK.    Revenue  of  $250
would also be assessed in the year of assessment 2018/19.    In the tax
computation for the year of assessment 2018/19, Company-HK should
declare the adjustment of $750 for assessment.

20

Scenario 2: Company-HK applied the transition provisions of HKFRS
15 using the modified retrospective method.    Adjustment was made to
increase its opening balance of retained earnings as below:

Year ended 31 December

2018
$
Revenue
250
Adjustment to opening balance of retained earnings  750

Total
$
250
750

Under the modified retrospective method, an adjustment of $750 would
be made to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of initial
application of HKFRS 15 (i.e. 1  January  2018).    The  adjustment of
$750 formed part of the contract revenue and would be assessed in the
year  of  assessment  2018/19  relating  to  the  basis  period  in  which
HKFRS  15  was  first  adopted  by  Company-HK.    Revenue  of  $250
would also be assessed in the year of assessment 2018/19.    In the tax
computation for the year of assessment 2018/19, Company-HK should
declare the adjustment of $750 for assessment.

PART C: MEASUREMENT OF INVENTORIES OR STOCK

INVENTORIES OR STOCK

Meaning of inventories or stock

39.
Inventories  can  be  anything  acquired  with  a  view  to  reselling  at  a
profit.    The  term  “trading  stock”  is  used  as  an  alternative  to  the  term
“inventories”  in  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally
accepted accounting principles.    For the purposes of this Practice Note, the two
terms are equivalent and interchangeable.

The primary issue in accounting for inventories is the amount of cost
40.
to be recognised as an asset and carried forward until the related revenues are
recognised.

Objective of HKAS 2

HKAS  2  Inventories  prescribes  the  accounting  treatment  for
41.
inventories  and  provides  guidance  on  the  determination  of  cost  and  its
subsequent recognition as an expense, including any write-down to net realisable
value.    It also provides guidance on the cost formulas that are used to assign
costs to inventories.    Appendix 5 gives an overview of HKAS 2.

COST OF STOCK

Opening and closing stock

A person has to account for the value of inventories at the end of each
42.
year  (i.e.  closing  stock).    The  value  of  closing  stock  at  the  end  of  a  year
automatically becomes the value of opening stock at the beginning of the next
year.    Since opening stock and closing stock are components of the calculation
of the cost of goods sold, it is necessary to have a correct and accurate valuation
of both opening and closing stock for a given period to ensure that the profits of
the person would not be overstated or understated.

22

Stock  valuation  can  never  be  absolutely  precise  since  there  are  a

43.
number of practical considerations which may affect the accuracy of the estimate.
Generally  accepted  accounting  principles  provide  the  starting  point  for  stock
valuation for tax purposes.    In the Ordinance, there are two specific provisions
relating to stock valuation:

(a)

(b)

section 15C provides for how trading stock should be valued
when a person ceases to carry on a trade or business in Hong
Kong; and

section 15BA provides for how trading stock should be valued
when  the  stock  is  appropriated  for  non-trade  purposes  or
disposed of otherwise than in the course of trade.

Stock expenses

The case of Whimster & Co v CIR [1925] 12 TC 813 established that
44.
the  correct  way  of  computing  trading  profits  for  tax  purposes  was  to  bring  in
opening  stock  and  closing  stock  into  the  computation  at  the  lower  of  cost  or
market value.    Nowadays, the basic rule is that stock is to be valued at the lower
of cost and net realisable value.

In Threlfall v Jones [1993] 66 TC 77, Lord Nolan discussed the long-
45.
standing practice of bringing into account unsold stock-in-trade at the beginning
and at the end of the period at the lower of cost or market value and the reasoning
behind and the effect of that practice.    He considered Lord Reid’s judgment in
Ostime v Duple Motor Bodies Ltd [1961] 39 TC 537 and concluded that, as a
matter of legal analysis, it involved the deduction of the whole of the expenses
incurred during the period but the crediting against them of a closing figure for
unsold stock and for work in progress as a notional receipt.

Valuation bases

The acceptable basis for stock is the lower of cost and net realisable
46.
value: see Whimster & Co v CIR [1925] 12 TC 813.    HKAS 2 also requires that
stock is to be measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.    An item
by item basis should be adopted for the valuation of stock at the lower of cost
and net realisable value: see CIR v Cock Russell & Co Ltd [1949] 29 TC 387.

23

The  need  for  the  basis  of  valuation  to  reflect  the  actual  facts  was
47.
emphasised in Minister of National Revenue  v Anaconda American  Brass Ltd
[1956] 2 WLR 31.    A valuation that pays insufficient attention to the facts will
not  be  acceptable  even  if  it  is  made  on  a  recognised  basis.    In  some
circumstances there may be more than one acceptable method of computing the
value of stock but the valuation policy should be consistent unless the reasons
for change outweigh the need for consistency.

Court decisions

48.

The Courts have ruled on certain methods:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

In  the  case  of  Bombay  Commissioner  of  Income  Tax  v
Ahmedabad  New  Cotton Mills  Co  Ltd  [1929]  8 ATC  575,  it
was  held  that  where  opening  and  closing  stocks  have  been
undervalued, the true profits can only be established by raising
both valuations.

CIR v Cock Russell  &  Co Ltd [1949] 29 TC  387, established
the  right  to  apply  cost  or  lower  market  value  to  individual
items of stock.

In Minister of National Revenue v Anaconda American Brass
Ltd [1956] 2 WLR 31, the last-in, first-out (LIFO)  method  of
determining  cost was rejected by the Privy Council.

In  Patrick  v  Broadstone Mills Ltd [1935] 35  TC  44,  the  base
stock  method  was  rejected,  even  though  it  was  accepted  as
sound  commercial practice in the cotton spinning trade.

In  Ostime  v  Duple  Motor  Bodies  Ltd  [1961]  39  TC  537,
consistency  in  the  basis  of  valuation  of  stock  and  work-in-
progress  was  stressed.    The  Courts,  however,  in  refusing  to
decide  between  the  rival  claims  of  direct  cost  and  on  cost
methods of valuation as a broad principle, found that the direct
cost  method, which had been consistently applied in the past,
was  one  of  the  methods  recognised  as  sound  accountancy
practice  and saw no reason, in the circumstances of that case,

24

to compel a change to the on cost basis.

(f)

(g)

In  BSC Footwear Ltd v  Ridgeway [1971] 47  TC  495,  it  was
held that for tax purposes replacement value is not acceptable.

In Pearce v Woodall-Duckham Ltd [1978] 51 TC 271, it was
held  that  the  estimated  accrued  profits  resulting  from  the
change in  valuation  method  of  work  in  progress  in  that  case
should  be  treated  as  a  taxable  receipt  for  the  year  in  which
the  amount was first revealed and brought into account.

Alternative valuation basis

Depending on the facts and circumstances, there may be two or more
49.
acceptable bases to valuing stock.    For profits tax purposes, the Commissioner
generally does not have the right to substitute one valid basis for another valid
basis, or to adopt a different basis in computing profits.    In Pearce v Woodall-
Duckham Ltd [1978] 51 TC 271, Templeman J said:

“the company was entitled to produce accounts based on its on-cost
method prior to 1969.    The company was entitled, but not bound, to
produce accounts for 1969 and subsequent years by the accrued profit
method.    The change was made for sound commercial reasons.”

Equally,  where  a  valid  basis  for  tax  purposes  has  been  adopted  in  a  person’s
financial statements, the person does not have the right to adopt a different basis
in computing the profits figure to be entered on the person’s tax return.

Change in basis of valuation

A  basis  of  stock  valuation  is  valid  if  it  is  in  accordance  with  the
50.
Ordinance or the generally accepted accounting principles applicable for a given
period.    However,  if  a  basis  of  stock  valuation  does  not  follow  the  generally
accepted accounting principles or the facts suggest that it does not reflect cost or
net realisable value, the basis may be invalid.

In  Bombay  Commissioner  of  Income  Tax  v  Ahmedabad  New
51.
Cotton Mills  Co  Ltd  [1929]  8  ATC  575,  the  company’s  account  for  the  year

25

ended 31 December 1925 described stock in trade as being below cost.    It was
subsequently agreed that the figure of closing stock in those accounts was about
37% of the proper valuation of lower of cost and market value.    The company
argued that if the value of closing stock was increased then it had to also increase
the  value  of  its  opening  stock  for  that  year  in  order  to  properly  compute  the
profits for that year.    The Privy Council agreed that in order to determine the
annual profit it was not correct to raise the valuation of the closing stock without
taking into consideration the similar undervaluation of the opening stock.    This
was a case in which the basis of valuation of stock was not an accepted method
and was invalid so the company was made to change for tax purposes to a valid
method.

52.
In Pearce v Woodall-Duckham Ltd [1978] 51 TC 271, the company
changed  its  method  of  valuing  work  in  progress  from  an  on-cost  basis  to  an
accrued profit basis in the 1969 accounts.    It valued both the opening and the
closing work in progress on the new basis and brought in the difference between
the 1968 closing value and the 1969 opening value as surplus arising on change
in valuation of contract work in progress at 31 December 1968.    The figure was
not taken to the trading profit and loss account but shown in the company’s profit
and  loss  appropriation  account  under  profit  after  taxation.    It  was  common
ground that both the old basis and the new basis were valid valuation methods
for work in progress and that the change had been made for sound commercial
reasons.    It was held that the amount of the adjustment was taxable in 1969 as
profits of that year.

For computing the full amount of profits, if there is a change from one
53.
valid basis on which the profits of a trade or business are calculated to another
valid  basis  (e.g.  on  a  change  of  accounting  policy),  an  adjustment  must  be
calculated to ensure that trading or business receipts will be taxed only once and
deductions will be given once and once only.

54.
Where the change is from an invalid basis to a valid basis, the profits
for  the  period  of  account  have  to  be  computed  on  the  new  valid  basis.    Any
adjustments which need to be made to previous periods’ computations in order
to  compute  those  profits  on  a  valid  basis  must  be  done  by  changing  the
computations for those periods.    Where the change is from one valid basis to
another valid basis for tax purposes, the taxable profits for the accounting period
include  any  tax  adjustment  needed  for  the  prior  period  adjustment.    The

26

adjustment  could  either  be  in  respect  of  profits  recognised  in  the  accounting
period or of a loss recognised in the accounting period.

Estimation of cost of stock

The  process  of  ascertaining  cost  of  stock  is  primarily  a  matter  of
55.
identification.    For physically identifiable and distinguishable items which are
sold  in  the  same  condition  as  they  are  bought,  the  cost  of  stock  should  be
specifically  identified  and  the  process  of  ascertaining  the  cost  of  such  stock
should  not  be  difficult.    Where  physical  identification  is  not  possible  (e.g.
interchangeable items), the cost of stock may not be ascertained precisely.    It is
thus  necessary  to  base  the  valuation  on  assumptions  to  arrive  at  the  closest
approximation to historical cost that is practically attainable.

Shares and securities that are stock

56.
Shares  and  securities  are  financial  instruments.    Thus,  they  are
outside  the  scope  of  HKAS  2.    The  accounting  treatment  of  shares  and
securities  is  covered  by  HKFRS  9  Financial  Instruments.    For  more  details
concerning the valuation and tax treatment of financial instruments, please refer
to  Part  A  of  Departmental  Interpretation  and  Practice  Notes  (DIPN)  No.  42
Profits  Tax  –  Taxation  of  Financial  Instruments  and  Taxation  of  Foreign
Exchange Differences.

Keeping stock records

57.
Section  51C  requires  a  person  carrying  on  a  trade,  profession  or
business in Hong Kong to keep sufficient records, in English or Chinese, of the
person’s income and expenditure to enable the person’s assessable profits to be
readily  ascertained.
  The  required  records  include  statements  (including
quantities  and  values)  of  trading  stock  held  by  the  person  at  the  end  of  each
accounting  period.    All  records  of  stocktakings  from  which  any  statement  of
trading  stock  has  been  prepared  should  be  retained.    Such  records  should
include:

(a)

a list describing each article of stock on hand (including raw
materials and work in progress), together with the value of each;

(b)

the person who did the stocktaking;

27

(c)

the way how the stocktaking was done;

(d)

the date of the stocktaking; and

(e)

the basis of the valuation.

It is an offence not to keep sufficient business records, with conviction carrying
a maximum penalty of $100,000.

ADJUSTMENT TO COST OF STOCK

Basis of valuation used

Since  more  than  one  interpretation  can  be  placed  on  the  term  “net
58.
realisable value” or “cost”, the Assessor should be made aware as to exactly what
basis of valuation has been used by a person.    Where the basis adopted for the
valuation of stock is one that is clearly not acceptable for profits tax purposes,
the adjustment that is considered necessary by the person should be made in the
profits  returned  for  assessment.    The  basis  on  which  the  adjustment  is  made
should be brought to the notice of the Assessor.

Once a satisfactory basis of valuation has been agreed, information is
59.
required  to  be  given  in  a  person’s  annual  profits  tax  return  only  if  there  is
subsequent change to the agreed basis.    It must be emphasised that the agreed
basis  of  stock  valuation  should  be  consistently  adopted.    Any  change  in  the
basis of valuation should be justified with documentary evidence.

Undervaluation of stock

From time to time, a clear undervaluation of stock for tax purposes is
60.
revealed in the financial statements submitted or discovered in the course of a
field  audit  or  investigation.    An  undervaluation  of  stock  that  gives  rise  to  an
understatement of profits for a year of assessment may be a result of:

(a)

a change from one valid basis of valuation to another;

(b)

the use of an invalid basis of valuation for both opening and
closing stock;

28

(c)

a change from an invalid basis of valuation to a valid basis;

(d)

a change from a valid basis of valuation to an invalid basis; or

(e)

an omission of stock or an incorrect estimation of quantity or
value.

If  an  incorrect  valuation  of  stock  (e.g.  an  omission  of  stock  or  incorrect
estimation of quantity or value) by a person gives rise to an understatement of
profits of the person,  depending  on the facts of the case, penal action  may be
considered.

Quantification of profit understatements

Change from one valid valuation basis to another

The opening stock figure in the year of change should remain the same
61.
as the closing stock figure for the preceding year.    The Commissioner will not
allow a tax free uplift where the change would result in a higher opening figure,
or seek to tax the trade or business where the change would result  in a lower
opening figure, in response to any contention that the opening and closing figures
are normally valued on the same basis.

Use of invalid valuation basis for both opening and closing stock

Both the opening stock and closing stock must be valued on a valid
62.
basis which is appropriate for the stock in question.    Depending on the facts of
the case, the Commissioner will review liabilities for earlier years.

Change from invalid valuation basis to valid basis

63.
The opening stock must be revalued on the same basis as the closing
stock.    The  liabilities  for  earlier  years  will  be  reviewed  if  it  is  considered
appropriate.    In  a  case  where  there  is  no  question  of  fraudulent  or  negligent
conduct, the total tax sought to be recovered for past years would not exceed the
“tax saving” resulting  from the uplift of the opening valuation for the  year of
change.

29

Change from valid valuation basis to invalid basis

64.
opening stock.    The valid basis must be followed for future years.

The  closing  stock  is  to  be  revalued  on  the  same  valid  basis  as  the

Omission of stock or incorrect estimation of quantity or value

65.
For cases where a valid basis is used, but there has been omission of
stock or incorrect estimation of quantity or value, the Assessor will ascertain the
amount of understatement by a method which is appropriate in the circumstances.
Various matters may be taken into account, e.g. the production process and the
average stock-holding period.

CESSATION OF BUSINESS

Valuation of stock on cessation of business

66.
Section 15C provides for the valuation of trading stock on cessation
of business.    In Southtime Limited v CIR [2002] 2 HKLRD 275, the court ruled
that if a taxpayer was carrying on two different businesses, or alternatively one
trade and one different business, and one of them subsequently ceased, section
15C will apply in respect of the one that ceased.    Where section 15C applies,
the  trading  stock  is  to  be  valued  at  the  date  of  cessation  for  the  purposes  of
computing the profits of the person who has ceased the trade or business.

Amount to be brought into account

67.
Where trading stock is sold or transferred for valuable consideration
to a person who carries on or intends to carry  on a trade or business in Hong
Kong so that the cost will be deductible when the profits of the purchaser’s trade
or business are computed, section 15C(a) provides that the actual consideration
(i.e. the sale price or the transfer price) should be brought into the final account
of the vendor.    Where trading stock falls outside the scope of section 15C(a)
(e.g. stock is not sold or is transferred not for valuable consideration), the amount
which it would have realised if sold in the open market at the date of cessation
should be brought into the final account.

30

APPROPRIATION OF STOCK

Rule in Sharkey v Wernher

68.
It  is  a  well-accepted  principle  that  tax  computation  needs  to  be
adjusted to reflect the market value of an asset with respect to which a change of
intention occurs (i.e. the market value principle): see Sharkey v Wernher [1956]
AC 58 and Simmons v IRC [1980] 1 WLR 1196.    The market value principle
also  applies  where  a  trading  stock  is  appropriated  for  non-trade  purpose  or
acquired/disposed  of  other  than  in  the  course  of  trade,  and  has  all  along  been
applied  in  Hong  Kong  in  determining  profits  or  loss  from  appropriation  or
disposal  of  trading  stock  for  profits  tax  purposes.    The  principle  has  been
applied by the Board of Review and the courts in a number of cases: see Church
Body of the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui & Anor v CIR (2016) 19 HKCFAR 54.

69.
Section  15BA,  which  was  enacted  under  the  Inland  Revenue
(Amendment)  (No.  6)  Ordinance  2018  to  codify  the  market  value  principle,
requires adjustments to taxable profits or allowable loss to reflect the following
at market value:

(a)

any appropriation from or into trading stock; or

(b)

any  acquisition  or  disposal  of  trading  stock  other  than  in  the
course of trade or business.

The  provisions  of  section  15BA  apply  in  relation  to  a  year  of  assessment
commencing on or after 1 April 2018.    For details relating to the market value
principle  and  the  relationship  between  sections  15BA,  15C  and  50AAF,
reference can be made to Appendix 4 (Trading Stock) of DIPN No. 59 Transfer
Pricing between Associated Persons.

Amount to be brought into account as receipt

Stock appropriated for non-trade purpose

70.
Where  trading  stock  of  a  trade  or  business  is  appropriated  for  non-
trade purpose, section 15BA(2) provides that the amount that should be brought
into account as a receipt for computing  profits is the amount that  would have

31

realised if the stock were sold in the open market (i.e. the market value) at the
time of the appropriation.    The actual amount received from the appropriation
of  trading  stock,  if  any,  is  to  be  left  out  of  account.    Trading  stock  is
appropriated for non-trade purpose when it is appropriated for a purpose other
than the relevant trade or business (e.g. the stock is taken by a person carrying
on a trade or business for private use or put into use in another trade or business
of  the  person).    Section  15BA(2)  also  applies  when  the  trading  stock  is
appropriated as capital asset meaning that a change of intention towards the asset
occurs.    The  market  value  that  should  be  brought  into  account  is  treated  as
arising on the date of the appropriation.

Stock disposed of otherwise than in the course of trade or business

Where trading  stock of a trade or business is disposed of otherwise
71.
than in the course of trade or business and section 15BA(2) does not apply, the
amount that would have realised if the stock were sold in the open market at the
time of the disposal should be brought into account as a receipt for computing
profits  as  per  section  15BA(4).    The  actual  consideration  obtained  for  the
disposal, if any, is to be left out of account.    Where trading stock is disposed of
by way of gift or through a sale of a trade or business, the trading stock should
be treated as being “disposed of otherwise than in the course of trade or business”.
The market value that should be brought into account is treated as arising on the
date of the disposal.

Amount to be brought into account as cost

72.
While section 15BA(2) and (4) concerns the value of trading stock to
be brought into the account as a receipt, section 15BA(3) and (5) concerns the
value of trading stock that should be included in the account as cost.    Section
15BA(3) applies when something that belongs to a person carrying on a trade or
business, but that is not trading stock of the trade or business, becomes trading
stock  of  the  trade  or  business.    This  covers  the  situation  where  the  person
changed intention of holding an asset as a capital asset to holding it as trading
stock of the trade or business.    Section 15BA(5) applies when the trading stock
of a trade or business has been acquired otherwise than in the course of trade or
business and section 15BA(3) does not apply.

32

When section 15BA(3) or (5) applies, the cost of stock to be included
73.
in  the  account  for  computing  profits  should  be  the  market  value.    The  value
given for an asset becoming trading stock or acquiring it as trading stock is to be
left out of account.    The cost of stock is treated as being incurred on the date
the asset became or was acquired as trading stock of the trade or business.

Appendix 1

Overview of HKFRS 15

Revenue recognition model

1.
The  core  principle  of  HKFRS  15  Revenue  from  Contracts  with
Customers is that an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised
goods or services to customers  in an amount that reflects the  consideration to
which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
An entity recognises revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying
the following steps:

(a)

Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer;

(b)

Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract;

(c)

Step 3: Determine the transaction price;

(d)

(e)

Step  4:  Allocate  the  transaction  price  to  the  performance
obligations in the contract; and

Step  5:  Recognise  revenue  when  (or  as)  the  entity  satisfies  a
performance obligation.

A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable
rights and obligations.    A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with
a customer to transfer to the customer either  a good or service or a  bundle of
goods or services that is distinct, or a series of distinct goods or services that are
substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.
When  an  entity  transfers  promised  goods  or  services  to  a  customer,  the
transaction price is the amount of consideration in a contract to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer.

Recognition of revenue

Recognise revenue when performance obligations are satisfied

2.
An entity shall recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a
performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service (i.e. an asset)
to a customer.    An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control
of that asset.    Control of an asset refers to the ability to direct the use of, and
obtain  substantially  all  of  the  remaining  benefits  from,  the  asset.    Control
includes  the  ability  to  prevent  other  entities  from  directing  the  use  of,  and
obtaining the benefits from, an asset.    The benefits of an asset are the potential
cash  flows  (inflows  or  savings  in  outflows)  that  can  be  obtained  directly  or
indirectly (e.g. using the asset to produce goods or services; using the asset to
enhance the value of other assets, using the asset to settle liabilities or reduce
expenses, selling or exchanging the asset, pledging the asset to secure a loan and
holding the asset).

3.
For each performance obligation identified, an entity shall determine
at contract inception whether it satisfies the performance obligation over time or
satisfies  the  performance  obligation  at  a  point  in  time.    If  an  entity  does  not
satisfy  a  performance  obligation  over  time,  the  performance  obligation  is
satisfied at a point in time.

Performance obligations satisfied over time

An  entity  transfers  control  of  a  good  or  service  over  time  and,
4.
therefore, satisfies a performance obligation and recognises revenue over time,
if one of the following criteria is met:

(a)

(b)

the  customer  simultaneously  receives  and  consumes  the
benefits  provided  by  the  entity’s  performance  as  the  entity
performs;

the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (e.g. work
in progress) that the customer controls as the asset is created or
enhanced; or

(c)

the  entity’s  performance  does  not  create  an  asset  with  an

ii

alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable
right to payment for performance completed to date.

5.
An  entity  shall  recognise  revenue  for  a  performance  obligation
satisfied over time only if the entity can reasonably measure its progress towards
complete  satisfaction  of  the  performance  obligation.    A  single  method  of
measuring progress should be applied for each performance obligation satisfied
over time.    Appropriate methods of measuring progress include output methods
(e.g. units produced, work certified or contract milestones achieved) and input
methods  (e.g.  costs  incurred,  labour  hours  expended  or  time  lapsed).    In
determining  the  appropriate  method  for  measuring  progress,  an  entity  shall
consider the nature of the good or service that the entity promised to transfer to
the customer.

Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time

If a performance obligation is not satisfied over time, the performance
6.
obligation is satisfied at a point in time.    To determine the point in time at which
a  customer  obtains  control  of  a  promised  asset  such  that  the  performance
obligation is satisfied, the entity shall consider the requirements for control and
indicators  of  the  transfer  of  control,  which  include,  but  are  not  limited  to  the
following:

(a)

the entity has a present right to payment for the asset;

(b)

the customer has legal title to the asset;

(c)

the entity has transferred physical possession of the asset;

(d)

the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership
of the asset;

(e)

the customer has accepted the asset.

iii

Transaction price allocated to performance obligation

Determining the transaction price

7.
When  (or  as)  a  performance  obligation  is  satisfied,  an  entity  shall
recognise  as  revenue  the  amount  of  the  transaction  price  (which  excludes
estimates of variable consideration that are constrained) that is allocated to that
performance  obligation.    To  determine  the  transaction  price,  an  entity  shall
consider  the  terms  of  the  contract  and  its  customary  business  practices.    The
transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be
entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer,
excluding  amounts  collected  on  behalf  of  third  parties.    The  consideration
promised  in  a  contract  with  a  customer  may  include  fixed  amounts,  variable
amounts, or both.

Variable consideration

rebates,

refunds,  credits,  price  concessions,

An amount of consideration promised in a contract can vary because
8.
of  discounts,
incentives,
performance  bonuses,  penalties  or  other  similar  items,  or  if  an  entity’s
entitlement  to  the  consideration  is  contingent  on  the  occurrence  or  non-
occurrence  of  a  future  event.    The  variability  relating  to  the  consideration
promised  by  a  customer  may  be  stated  in  a  contract  or  otherwise  (e.g.  the
customer  has  a  valid  expectation  arising  from  an  entity’s  customary  business
practices that the entity will accept an amount of consideration that is less than
the price stated in the contract).    An amount of variable consideration may be
estimated using either  the expected value  method (i.e. the sum of probability-
weighted  amounts  in  a  range  of  possible  consideration  amounts)  or  the  most
likely amount method (i.e. the single most likely amount in a range of possible
consideration amounts), depending on which method an entity expects to better
predict  the  amount  of  consideration  that  the  entity  will  be  entitled  to.    The
estimated amount of variable consideration will be included in the transaction
price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the
amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty
associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.

iv

Significant financing component

An entity shall adjust the promised amount of consideration for the
9.
effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the
parties  of  the  contract  provides  the  customer  or  the  entity  with  a  significant
benefit  of financing  the  transfer  of  goods  or  services  to  the  customer  (i.e.  the
contract contains a significant financing component).    A significant financing
component may exist regardless of whether the promise of financing is explicitly
stated in the contract or implied by the payment terms agreed to by the parties of
the contract.

The objective for adjusting the promised amount of consideration for
10.
a  significant  financing  component  is  to  recognise  revenue  at  an  amount  that
reflects  the  price  that  a  customer  would  have  paid  for  the  promised  goods  or
services if the customer has paid cash for those goods or services when they are
transferred  to  the  customer  (i.e.  the  cash  selling  price).    To  assess  whether  a
contract contains a significant financing component, an entity shall consider all
relevant facts and circumstances, including: the difference between the amount
of promised consideration and the cash selling price of the promised goods and
services,  and  the  expected  length  of  time  between  the  transfer  of  goods  and
services and payment, and the prevailing interest rates in the relevant market.

An  entity  shall  use  the  discount  rate  that  would  be  reflected  in  a
11.
separate  financing  transaction  between  the  entity  and  the  entity’s  customer  at
contract inception.    An entity is required to present the effects of financing (i.e.
interest revenue or interest expense) separately from revenue from contracts with
customers  in  the  statement  of  comprehensive  income.    Interest  revenue  or
interest expense is recognised only to the extent that a contract asset or receivable
or a contract liability is recognised for a contract with a customer.

Allocating the transaction price

12.
An  entity  has  to  allocate  the  transaction  price  to  each  performance
obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the
entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or
services to the customer.    An entity shall allocate the transaction price to each
performance obligation in proportion to the relative stand-alone selling price of
the  promised  good  or  service.    The  stand-alone  selling  price  is  the  price  at

v

which an entity would sell the good or service separately to a customer.    Where
the stand-alone selling price of the good or service is not directly observable, the
entity has to estimate the stand-alone selling price using suitable methods which
may  include  but  are  not  limited  to  adjusted  market  assessment  approach,
expected cost plus a margin approach and residual approach.

Contract costs

Costs of obtaining a contract

13.
HKFRS 15 deals with the costs of obtaining a contract and the costs
of fulfilling a contract.    An entity  shall recognise as an asset the  incremental
costs  of  obtaining  a  contract  with  a  customer  (i.e.  costs  that  would  not  have
incurred if the contract had not been obtained) if the entity expects to recover
those  costs.    The  incremental  costs  are  amortised  on  a  basis  that  reflects  the
transfer  of  goods  or  services  to  the  customer.    The  incremental  costs  of
obtaining  a  contract  can  be  recognised  as  an  expenses  when  incurred  if  the
amortisation period is one year or less.

Costs to obtain a contract that would have been incurred regardless of
14.
whether  the  contract  was  obtained  shall  be  recognised  as  an  expense  when
incurred, unless those costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer regardless
of whether the contract is obtained.

Costs of fulfilling a contract

15.
Any costs incurred to fulfill a contract that do not fall within the scope
of another standard (e.g. HKAS 2 Inventories, HKAS 16  Property, Plant and
Equipment or HKAS 38 Intangible Assets) are to be accounted for in accordance
with HKFRS 15.    Under HKFRS 15, the following costs are to be recognised
when incurred:

(a)

general and administrative costs;

(b)

costs of wasted materials, labour or other resources to fulfil the
contract that were not reflected in the price of the contract;

(c)

costs  relating  to  performance  obligations  that  have  been

vi

satisfied (i.e. costs relating to past performance); and

(d)

costs that an entity cannot distinguish as relating to satisfied or
unsatisfied performance obligations.

16.
shall be recognised as asset if those costs meet all of the following:

Costs  incurred  for  fulfilling  a  contract  that  are  not  identified  above

(a)

(b)

the costs relate directly to a contract or an anticipated contract
that is specifically identifiable;

the costs generate or enhance resources of the entity that will
be used to satisfy performance obligations in the future; and

(c)

the costs are expected to be recovered.

Costs that relate directly to a contract or an anticipated contract include direct
labour, direct materials, allocation of costs that relate directly to the contract or
contract activities (e.g. insurance and depreciation of tools and equipment used
in  fulfilling  the  contract),  costs  that  are  explicitly  chargeable  to  the  customer
under the contract and other costs that are incurred only because an entity entered
into the contract (e.g. payments to subcontractors).

Appendix 2

Construction Contracts

Meaning of construction contracts

1.
Construction contracts include engineering and construction contracts
which  appoint  contractors  for  engineering  and  construction  work  (e.g.
construction of roads).    Construction contracts  are long-term contracts which
normally  take  more  than  one  year  to  complete.    In  this  Appendix,  long-term
construction  contracts  refer  to  contracts  under  which  engineering  and
construction  work  extends  beyond  one  year  of  assessment.    A  construction
contract which runs for less than twelve months, but straddles two or more years
of assessment is therefore regarded as a long-term construction contract.

2.

Profits from long-term construction contracts include:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

profits from construction of buildings, bridges, dams, pipelines,
tunnels and other civil engineering projects;

profits from related activities (e.g. demolition, dredging, heavy
earth moving projects);

profits  from  the  construction  of  major  plant  items  including
ships and transport vessels;

profits from similar contracts in associated fields, depending on
the facts and circumstances (i.e. the contract and substance of
the agreement), like air conditioning contracts, major electrical
wiring  or  rewiring  contracts,  major  refurbishment  of  hotels,
stores; and

(e)

profits from major construction management contracts.

3.
A long-term construction contract does not include a contract for the
sale and supply of what may ordinarily be regarded as the sale of trading stock

(e.g.  it  does  not  include  a  contract  for  the  supply  and  installation  of  office
furniture in a new building even though the furniture may need to be assembled
upon delivery).    In general, profits from sale of trading stock are derived for
profits  tax  purposes  when  the  trading  stock  is  sold  and  a  debt  is  created
notwithstanding that the debt is not payable until a future year: see J Rowe  &
Son Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation (1971) 124 CLR 421.

4.
Before  HKFRS  15  Revenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers  had
become effective, the accounting treatment of revenue and costs associated with
construction  contracts  was  prescribed  by  HKAS  11  Construction  Contracts.
Under HKAS 11,

(a)  when the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated
reliably, contract revenue and contract costs associated with the
construction  contract  should  be  recognised  as  revenue  and
expenses respectively by reference to the stage of completion
of the contract activity at the end of the reporting period; and

(b)

any expected excess of total contract costs over total contract
revenue  for  contract  should  be  recognised  as  an  expense
immediately.

HKAS 11 did not allow the adoption of the realisation or completion of contract
method which recognise profits only when a contract was completed.

Recognition of revenue from construction contracts

Under HKFRS 15, revenue is recognised when (or as) performance
5.
obligations are satisfied through the transfer of control of a good or service under
a  construction  contract  to  a  customer.    For  examples,  revenue  is  recognised
over  time  if  the  customer  receives  and  consumes  the  benefits  from  the
engineering  and  construction  services  as  they  are  provided,  and  revenue  is
recognised at a point in time if the plant constructed has to be delivered to the
customer before a right to enforce payment arises.    If a performance obligation
is not satisfied over time, it is satisfied at a point in time.

Though  HKFRS  15  retains  over  time  revenue  recognition  which  is
6.
similar  to  the  stage  of  completion  method  under  HKAS  11,  specified  criteria

ii

must be met before revenue can be recognised over time.    Under HKFRS 15, a
performance obligation is satisfied over time when at least one of the following
three criteria is met:

(a)

(b)

(c)

the  customer  simultaneously  receives  and  consumes  the
benefits  provided  by  the  entity’s  performance  as  the  entity
performs;

the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the
customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or

the  entity’s  performance  does  not  create  an  asset  with  an
alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable
right to payment for performance completed to date.

Criterion (a) may not be relevant: the customer does not simultaneously receive
and  consume  the  benefits  provided  by  the  contractor’s  performance  as  the
contractor performs.    Criterion (b) may be relevant: construction work is done
on the customer’s premises.    Criterion (c)  may  also be relevant:  construction
contracts  commonly  create  an  asset  in  accordance  with  customers’  specific
requirements.    Such asset is less likely to have an alternative use because it may
be  highly  customised  for  a  particular  customer  or  significant  costs  have  to  be
incurred to reconfigure the asset for sale to another customer.    The asset created
does  not  have  an  alternative  use  to  the  entity  if  the  entity  is  either  restricted
contractually from readily directing the asset for another use during the creation
or  enhancement  of  that  asset  or  limited  practically  from  readily  directing  the
asset in its completed state for another use.    When evaluating whether the entity
has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, the entity
shall consider the terms of the contract and any laws that apply to the contract.
The entity has a right to payment for performance completed to date if the entity
would  be  entitled  to  an  amount  that  at  least  compensates  the  entity  for
performance completed to date (e.g. recovery of costs incurred plus a reasonable
profit  margin)  in  the  event  that  the  customer  or  another  party  terminates  the
contract for reasons other than the entity’s failure to perform as promised.

7.
If a performance obligation is satisfied over time, revenue should be
recognised  over  time  by  measuring  the  progress  towards  completion  using  a
method that best depicts the transfer of the goods or services to the customer (e.g.

iii

output  methods  or  input  methods).    Depending  on  the  method  adopted,
significant  estimates  and  judgments  may  be  required  having  regard  to  past
experience.

Example 1

On 1 August 2019, Construction Company-HK entered into a contract
to  construct  a  hotel  for  a  customer  and  the  customer  paid  a  non-
refundable  deposit.    The  customer  was  required  to  make  progress
payments  to  Construction  Company-HK  during  the  period  of
construction.    Construction Company-HK was not allowed to direct
any parts of the hotel to another customer and the customer could not
terminate  the  contract  unless  Construction  Company-HK  failed  to
perform in accordance with the contract terms.

Construction  Company-HK  was  required  to  determine  on  1  August
2019  whether  its  promise  to  construct  and  transfer  the  hotel  to  the
customer was a performance obligation satisfied over time or at a point
in  time.
  Since  the  contract  had  substantial  terms  precluding
Construction Company-HK to redirect any parts of the hotel to another
customer, Construction Company-HK would not have an alternative
use  of  the  hotel.    If  Construction  Company-HK  had  the  right  to
payment  for  performance  completed  to  date  in  accordance  with  the
terms  of  the  contract,  Construction  Company-HK  should  recognise
the  contract  revenue,  including  the  deposit,  over  time  because  it
satisfied the performance obligation over time.    Profits derived from
the  construction  contract  for  each  reporting  period  should  be
determined  in  accordance  with  HKFRS  15,  taking  into  account  the
expenses incurred.    If tax adjustments to the profits were not required
under the Ordinance, Construction Company-HK would be assessed
in  respect  of  the  reported  profits  from  the  construction  contract  for
each year of assessment.

The application of revenue recognition criteria under HKFRS 15 may
8.
similarly  result  in  the  recognition  of  revenue  over  time  for  long-term
construction contracts (i.e. similar to the stage of completion method in HKAS
11)  subject  to  the  meeting  of  specific  criteria.    To  decide  whether  revenue
should be recognised over time, it will be necessary to evaluate contracts against

iv

HKFRS 15’s criteria.    Profits arising from a construction contract recognised
in the financial statements in accordance with HKFRS 15 would generally be
adopted for profits tax purposes.

9.
If the financial statements are prepared in accordance with HKFRS 15
and revenue is recognised over time, the Commissioner would not accept any
profits be excluded from assessment by way of a computational adjustment on
the ground that the profits are not taxable until the entire contract is completed.
If a person is required to prepare financial statements in accordance with HKFRS
15  and  to  recognise  profits  over  time  but  the  person  has  failed  to  do  so,  the
Commissioner will make an adjustment to the returned profits to assess profits
which should have been recognised over time: see Smith v Revenue and Customs
Commissioners [2011] STC 1724.

Variable consideration

It  is  common  for  a  construction  contract  to  contain  an  element  of
10.
consideration that is variable or contingent upon certain thresholds or event being
achieved or occurred (e.g. awards or incentive payments, penalties and claims).
Revenue related to variable consideration has to be included in the transaction
price  and  recognised  if  it  is  highly  probable  that  a  significant  reversal  in  the
amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty
associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.

Example 2

Ship Building Company-HK entered into a construction contract with
a customer to build a ship which was required to be delivered on 31
December  2021.    The  building  work  commenced  on  1  May  2019.
The agreed contract price was $48 million.    Ship Building Company-
HK would be paid an award fee of $2 million if the ship was completed
on time.    During the year ended 31 December 2019, Ship Building
Company-HK incurred costs of $9 million, including cost of material
of $1 million which could not be used for failing to meet the required
standard.    Total  cost  of  the  building  work,  excluding  the  wasted
material  of  $1  million,  was  $20  million.    The  value  of  the  work
certified as at 31 December 2019 was $18 million.

v

Ship Building Company-HK determined at contract inception that the
performance obligation was satisfied over time.    Since the building
work  was  progressing  ahead  of  the  agreed  schedule,  Ship  Building
Company-HK assessed that there was a 80% chance that the building
work of the ship would be completed on time.

Scenario 1: Ship Building Company-HK adopted an input method to
recognise revenue.

Scenario 2: Ship Building Company-HK adopted an output method to
recognise revenue.

The  award  fee  of  $2 million  was  a  variable  consideration.    If  Ship
Building  Company-HK  adopted  the  most  likely  amount  method  to
estimate the transaction price (i.e. two possible outcomes $48 or $50
million), the transaction price would be $50 million since the building
work would most likely be completed on time.    The transaction price
of $50 million included the variable consideration of $2 million.

Scenario 1
If  the  input  method  based  on  costs  incurred  to  date  was  used,  the
building work would be 40% complete (i.e. costs incurred to date ($9
million–$1 million)  ÷  total expected costs $20 million).    Revenue
recognised  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2019  would  be  $20
million  (i.e.  $50  million  ×   40%).    Such  revenue,  including  the
allocated  variable  consideration,  which  was  determined  by  Ship
Building Company-HK with reasonable certainty, should be assessed
in the year of assessment 2019/20.    Though the wasted materials of
$1  million  were  not  accounted  for  under  the  input  method  for
measuring  the  work  progress,  the  costs  should  be  charged  in  the
accounts as a wastage expense.

Scenario 2
If the output method based on work certified was adopted, the building
work  would  be  36%  complete  (i.e.  work  certified  $18  million  ÷
transaction  price  $50  million).    Revenue  recognised  for  the  year
ended  31  December  2019  would  be  $18  million  (i.e.  $50  million  ×
36%).    Such revenue, including the allocated variable consideration,

vi

should be assessed in the year of assessment 2019/20.

Significant financing component

11.
The  existence  of  a  significant  financing  component  is  of  particular
relevance for long-term construction contracts in which payments by a customer
and performance by a person may occur at significantly different times.    It is
therefore necessary to assess the timing of customer payments in relation to the
transfer of goods and services by the person.    If the timing of payments agreed
to by the parties to a construction contract, explicitly or implicitly, provides a
significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer
or the person, it may indicate that the contract contains a significant financing
component such that the promised amount of consideration should be adjusted
for the time value of money.

12.
The effect of financing (i.e. interest revenue or interest expense) is to
be  separately  presented  from  the  revenue  from  a  construction  contract.    The
required tax adjustments in paragraphs 36 and 37 of this DIPN, resulting from
notional  interest  revenue  and  interest  expense,  are  equally  applicable  to  a
construction contract which contains a significant financing component.

Example 3

On  1  January  2018,  Ship  Building  Company-HK  entered  into  a
contract with a customer for building a ship.    The ship was scheduled
for  completion  within  two  years  and  control  of  the  ship  would  be
passed to the customer upon completion (i.e. performance obligation
would be satisfied at a point in time).    The customer agreed to pay
$20  million  at  the  contract  inception.    The  incremental  borrowing
rate of Ship Building Company-HK was 5%.

Ship Building Company-HK closed its accounts on 31 December each
year.    Given  that  the  contract  contained  a  significant  financing
component,  Ship  Building  Company-HK  accounted  for  the  revenue
and significant financing component in accordance with HKFRS 15
as follows:

vii

Account

Debit
$

Credit
$

Year ended 31 December 2018
To recognise receipt of funds:
    Bank

Contract liability

20,000,000

20,000,000

To recognise interest expense:
    Interest expense ($20m  ×  5%)
        Contract liability

1,000,000

1,000,000

Year ended 31 December 2019
To recognise interest expense:

Interest expense ($21m  ×  5%)

1,050,000

Contract liability

1,050,000

To recognise revenue upon transfer of the ship:
    Contract liability
        Revenue

22,050,000

22,050,000

Though interest expense was recognised in the accounts for the year
ended 31 December 2018 and 2019 as required under HKFRS 15, Ship
Building Company-HK did not incur any interest (i.e. it had no legal
obligation  to  pay  interest  to  the  customer).    The  notional  interest
expense of $1,000,000 and $1,050,000 should be ignored for profits
  Revenue  of  $20,000,000  (i.e.  $22,050,000 –
tax  purposes.
$1,000,000–$1,050,000) should be  recognised upon  transfer of the
ship  to  the  customer  in  the  year  of  assessment  2019/20.    Details
regarding the tax  adjustments  should be clearly  disclosed in  the tax
computation prepared by Ship Building Company-HK for the years of
assessment 2018/19 and 2019/20 respectively.

Example 4

Construction Company-HK entered into a three-year contract for the
construction of a hospital which included progress payments based on
various  contractual  milestones.    The  performance  obligation  to
construct  the  hospital  was  satisfied  over  time  and  the  payment

viii

milestones  were  estimated  to  coincide  with  Construction  Company-
HK’s  expected  performance.
  The  contract  specified  that  the
customer would retain 5% of each milestone payment throughout the
contract  and  only  pay  the  amounts  retained  to  Construction
Company-HK upon completion.

Construction  Company-HK  had  to  consider  all  relevant  facts  and
circumstances,  including  the  substantive  business  purposes  of  the
progress payments, to determine whether the contract had a significant
financing component.    If the withholding of a specified percentage
of  each  milestone  payment  was  a  typical  payment  term  of  the
construction  industry  intending  to  protect  the  customer  from
Construction  Company-HK’s  failure  to  adequately  complete  its
obligations  under  the  contract,  the  amounts  to  be  retained  by  the
customer would be for a primary purpose other than the provision of
finance to Construction Company-HK.    Construction Company-HK
thus  concluded  that  the  construction  contract  did  not  include  a
significant financing component and would not be required to adjust
the  transaction  price  for  the  effects  of  the  time  value  of  money  in
accordance with HKFRS 15.    Since no notional interest expense was
charged  in  the  accounts,  tax  adjustments  were  not  required  for  re-
computing the correct amount of profits for tax purposes.

Loss making contracts

Unlike  HKAS  11  which  specifically  required  an  expected  loss  of  a
13.
construction contract (i.e. total contract costs exceeding total contract revenue)
to  be  recognised  as  an  expense  immediately,  the  amount  of  contract  costs  or
provisions which are determined in accordance with the ordinary principles of
accounting would be deductible, subject to the conditions for deduction set out
in the Ordinance being satisfied.

Contract costs

14.
Various  costs  incurred  prior  to  commencement  of  a  construction
contract  may  arise  (e.g.  mobilisation  costs,  site  set  up  costs  and  costs  of
feasibility studies) and they are costs incurred to fulfill a contract.    Where such
costs  of  fulfilling  a  contract  are  expected  to  be  recovered,  they  should  be

ix

capitalised  and  amortised  over  the  course  of  the  contract  consistent  with  the
transfer  of  goods  or  services  to  a  customer.    Thus,  deduction  of  such  costs
would follow the amortisation treatment in HKFRS 15.

Building site or construction or installation project constituting a
permanent establishment

15.
Construction or installation projects or activities performed at a site in
Hong Kong by a non-Hong Kong resident person may give rise to a permanent
establishment  if  it  is  a  fixed  place  of  business  through  which  the  person’s
business is wholly or partly carried on and the activities carried on by the person
are not preparatory or auxiliary.    If a non-Hong Kong resident person is a DTA
territory1  resident  person,  the  question  whether  the  non-Hong  Kong  resident
person  has  a  permanent  establishment  in  Hong  Kong  is  to  be  determined  in
accordance with the permanent establishment article of the relevant DTA.    If
the non-Hong Kong resident person is a non-DTA territory resident person, the
question is to be determined in accordance with Part 3 of Schedule 17G of the
Ordinance.

For  a  building  site  or  construction  or  installation  project,  it  will  be
16.
regarded  as  a  permanent  establishment  of  an  enterprise  which  is  a  non-DTA
territory resident person under section 4(3) of Part 3 of Schedule 17G if:

(a)

the enterprise has carried on activities at the site or project for
a period of more than 12 months; or

(b)

all of the following apply:

(i)

(ii)

the  enterprise  has  carried  on  activities  at  the  site  or
project for a period that exceeds, or two or more periods
that in the aggregate exceed, 30 days;

connected activities have been carried on at the site or
project by one or more closely related enterprises of the
enterprise  for  one  or  more  different  periods  that  each
exceeds 30 days;

1  A DTA territory means a territory with which Hong Kong has made a double taxation agreement or

arrangement (DTA).

x

(iii)

all the periods referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) in
the aggregate exceed 12 months.

The term “building site or construction or installation project” should cover the
work listed in paragraph 2 of this Appendix and installation work related to a
construction project.    The 12-month threshold should apply to each individual
site or project.

A  building  site  exists  from  the  date  on  which  the  building  or
17.
construction  work  begins,  including  any  preparatory  work,  in  the  jurisdiction
where the building or  construction work is  to be established.    The site would
continue to exist until the work is completed and the building or facilities are
delivered  to  the  customer,  or  the  work  is  permanently  abandoned.    However,
any period of temporary interruption or discontinuation of work (e.g. due to bad
weather) should not be excluded from counting the period of time under section
4(3) of Part 3 of Schedule 17G.

18.
If a building site or construction or installation project of a non-Hong
Kong resident person constitutes a permanent establishment in Hong Kong, the
non-Hong Kong resident person is regarded as carrying on a trade, profession or
business in Hong Kong for the purpose of charging profits tax in accordance with
the  provisions  of  section  50AAK(1).
  The  profits  attributable  to  the
construction permanent establishment will be charged to profits tax.    For more
details on the meaning of permanent establishment and the two-step approach
for profits attribution to a permanent establishment, please refer to DIPN No. 60
Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments in Hong Kong

Chargeability  to  profits  tax  under  section  14  does  not  depend  on
19.
having a permanent establishment in Hong Kong.    Profits arising in or derived
from Hong Kong in respect of a business carried on in Hong Kong by a non-
DTA  territory  resident  person,  without  a  permanent  establishment,  are
chargeable  to  profits  tax.    The  Commissioner  generally  takes  the  view  that  a
non-DTA territory resident person which undertakes construction or installation
projects  or  performs  activities  at  a  site  in  Hong  Kong  would  be  regarded  as
carrying on a business in Hong Kong and profits arising in or derived from Hong
Kong from such business would be chargeable to profits tax.

Appendix 3

Real Estate Development

Property developed for resale and investment property

1.
In  this  Appendix,  the  term  “real  estate  development”  refers  to
development of property for resale and does not cover development of property
for letting (i.e. earning rentals) or capital appreciation (e.g. long-term business
use).    Property that is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both is
defined  as  “investment  property”  under  HKAS  40  Investment  Property.
Accordingly, the definition of “investment property” under HKAS 40 does not
cover “real estate development” referred to in this Appendix.    Appendix 4 gives
an overview of investment property under HKAS 40.

Pre-completion sale of units in multi-storey residential building

2.
In Hong Kong, developers construct or cause to be constructed multi-
storey  residential  buildings  with  multiple  units  and  enter  into  pre-completion
sales in respect of such units with customers in the retail market.    Before the
application of HKFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, real estate
pre-completion sales in Hong Kong were generally recognised at a single point
in time as a sale of goods in accordance with HKAS 11 Construction Contracts,
HKAS 18 Revenue and in conjunction with the guidance under HK(IFRIC)-Int 15
Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, particularly paragraphs 16 to 19.

The sale and purchase agreements used by developers are standardised
3.
to a large extent (e.g. the standard sale and purchase agreement available on the
website  of  the  Law  Society  of  Hong  Kong)  while  the  legal  and  regulatory
environment and other specific facts and circumstances in Hong Kong are quite
different  from  those  in  other  jurisdictions.    In  Hong  Kong,  the  construction
activity  relating  to  multi-storey  residential  buildings  has  to  be  at  an  advanced
stage  before  the  developer  is  allowed  to  enter  into  any  pre-completion  sales
agreements with retail customers.

When  a  customer  decides  to  buy  a  particular  unit  from  a  developer
4.
before the construction is complete, the customer will usually first enter into a

preliminary agreement for sale and purchase (PASP) with the developer.    The
PASP constitutes a legally enforceable contract which specifies:

(a)

the property to be delivered;

(b)

the consideration;

(c)

the date of completion of the sale and purchase; and

(d)

a payment schedule if payment is to be effected by instalments.

According to the Residential Properties (First-hand Sales) Ordinance
5.
(Cap. 621), at the time of signing the PASP, the customer is required to pay a
preliminary deposit of 5% of the purchase price.    For the purchase to proceed
further, the customer is required to enter into a formal agreement for sale and
purchase (ASP) with the developer that supersedes the PASP within five working
days  after  signing  the  PASP.    The  ASP  will  contain  more  detailed  terms
governing the sale and purchase than the PASP.  If the customer fails to enter
into  the  ASP,  the  PASP  is  terminated, the  developer  forfeits  the  preliminary
deposit and the developer does not have any further claim against the customer
for the failure to enter into the ASP.

The five-step revenue recognition model under HKFRS 15 is analysed
6.
below  in  the  context  of  a  sale  of  such  a  pre-completed  unit  in  a  multi-storey
residential building:

Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer

(a)

The  PASP  is  a  legally  binding  contract  while  the  ASP
supersedes  the  PASP.    In  the  context  of  HKFRS  15,  the
contract  inception  date  is  the  date  when  the  PASP  is  entered
into.

Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract

(b)

The single performance obligation of the developer for selling
a unit in a multi-storey residential building in Hong Kong is:
the obligation to complete the construction and assign the right

ii

to  occupy  a  specified  unit  together  with  the  associated
undivided  interests  in  the  land  on  which  the  building  is
  Though  there  may  be  other  performance
constructed.
obligations  identified  from  a  full  assessment  of  all  the  terms
and  conditions  of  the  contract,  it  is  assumed  such  other
performance obligations are not material.

Step 3: Determine the transaction price

(c)

The transaction price is the consideration for the unit, which is
fixed and stated in both the PASP and ASP.

Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract

(d)

The  transaction  price  identified  is  required  to  be  allocated  to
each  performance  obligation  identified.    On  the  assumption
that  other  performance  obligations  are
the
transaction  price  is  to  be  allocated  to  the  single  performance
obligation identified in the contract.

immaterial,

Step  5:  Determine  when  the  transaction  price  allocated  to  each
separate  performance  obligation  should  be  recognised  as  revenue,
being at a particular point in time or over time

(e)

Per  paragraph  35  of  HKFRS  15,  revenue  for  any  contract  is
recognised  over  time  when  any  one  or  more  of  the  criteria
below is met:

(i)

(ii)

the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the
benefits provided by the developer’s performance as the
developer performs;

the  developer’s  performance  creates  or  enhances  an
asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or
enhanced; or

(iii)

the  developer’s  performance  does  not  create  an  asset

iii

with  an  alternative  use  to  the  developer  and  the
developer  has  an  enforceable  right  to  payment  for
performance completed to date.

If  none  of  these  criteria  are  met,  then  the  revenue  must  be
recognised at a point in time.    Criterion (i) is not relevant to
pre-completion  sales:  the  customer  does  not  simultaneously
receive and consume the benefits provided by the developer’s
performance as the developer performs.    Criterion (ii) is not
relevant: the customer does not obtain physical possession of
or access to the purchased unit in the multi-storey residential
building until completion.    Criterion (iii) is also not relevant:
though the developer in a pre-completion sale under a standard
ASP  is  contractually  restricted  from  re-selling  the  purchased
unit to another customer, the developer in Hong Kong does not
have  an  enforceable  right  to  payment  for  performance
completed  to  date  given  the  customary  practice  regarding
payment and the uncertainty of the equitable relief of specific
performance.

In summary, the Commissioner accepts that consideration from pre-completion
sales  to  customers  in  the  retail  market  of  units  in  a  multi-storey  residential
building,  under  standard ASPs  in  Hong  Kong  with  typical  contractual  terms,
should not be recognised as revenue until the point in time at which the developer
fully satisfies the performance obligation (i.e. when the customer obtains control
over the purchased unit).

Variable consideration

7.
For real estate development, variable consideration may come in the
form  of  claims,  awards,  rebates  or  other  similar  items.    The  promised
consideration can also vary if a developer’s entitlement to the consideration is
contingent on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event.    A developer
is  required  to  estimate  variable  consideration  using  either  the  expected  value
method (i.e. the sum of probability-weighted amounts) or the most likely amount
method  (i.e.  the  single  most  likely  outcome),  whichever  better  predicts  the
amount of consideration to which the developer will be entitled.    The developer
has  to  include  variable  consideration  in  the  transaction  price  if  the  developer

iv

concludes that it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal will not
occur  when  the  uncertainties  related  to  the  variability  are  resolved.    The
Commissioner’s view on the tax treatment of variable consideration in paragraph
34 of this DIPN should be followed.

Significant financing component

8.
In Hong Kong, it is common for developers to offer different payment
schemes to customers.    When the timing of payments by a customer is different
from  the  timing  of  revenue  recognition  (i.e.  deferred  payments  or  advanced
payments), a developer has to consider all relevant facts and circumstances and
apply  judgement  in  determining  whether  the  PASP  contains  a  significant
financing  component.    The  financing  component  is  estimated  at  the  time  the
PASP is entered into and the payment plan is confirmed by the customer.    When
the financing effect of the PASP is significant, the developer has to account for
interest  revenue  or  interest  expenses  separately  from  revenue  from  the  PASP.
The required tax adjustments in paragraphs 36 and 37 of this DIPN, resulting
from notional interest revenue and interest expense, are equally applicable to a
PASP which contains a significant financing component.

Appendix 4

Investment Property

Overview of HKAS 40

1.
HKAS 40 Investment Property prescribes the accounting treatment for
investment  property.    Under  HKAS  40,  “investment  property”  is  defined  to
mean  property  (land  or  building  or  a  part  of  a  building  or  both)  held  (by  the
owner  or  by  the  lessee  as  a  right-of-use  asset)  to  earn  rentals  or  for  capital
appreciation, or both, rather than for:

(a)

use  in  the  production  or  supply  of  goods  or  services  or  for
administrative purposes (i.e. owner-occupied property); or

(b)

sale in the ordinary course of business.

Therefore, an investment property generates cash flows largely independently of
the other assets held by an entity.    This distinguishes investment property from
owner-occupied property where the production or supply of goods or services or
the  use  of  property  for  administrative  purposes  generates  cash  flows  that  are
attributable not only to property, but also to other assets used in the production
or supply process.

“Owner-occupied  property”  is  defined  under  HKAS  40  to  mean
2.
property held (by the owner or by the lessee as a right-of-use asset) for use in the
production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.

3.
The definition of investment property in effect refers to both owned
investment  property  and  leased  investment  property  while  the  definition  of
owner-occupied property in effect refers to both owned owner-occupied property
and leased owner-occupied property.

4.
held by an owner (i.e. owned investment property).

In this Appendix, the term “investment property” refers to one that is

5.

HKAS 40 provides some examples of investment property, including:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

land  held  for  long-term  capital  appreciation  rather  than  for
short-term sale in the ordinary course of business;

land held for a currently undetermined future use if it has not
been determined that the land will be used as owner-occupied
property  or  for  short-term  sale  in  the  ordinary  course  of
business;

a building owned by the entity (or a right-of-use asset relating
to a building held by the entity) and leased out under one or
more operating leases;

a building that is vacant but is held to be leased out under one
or more operating leases;

property that is being constructed or developed for future use
as investment property.

Therefore, property that is intended for sale in the ordinary course of business or
in  the  process  of  construction  or  development  for  such  sale  (i.e.  real  estate
development referred to in Appendix 3) is not investment property as defined in
HKAS 40.    For profits tax purposes, a property acquired with the intention for
resale at a profit is a trading asset (i.e. the property is acquired with a trading
motive).

6.
Under  HKAS  40,  an  owned  investment  property  shall  be  measured
initially  at  cost,  together  with  transaction  costs.    After  initial  recognition,  an
entity  shall  choose  the  cost  model  or  the  fair  value  model 1   to  measure  all
investment property of the entity.    If the cost model is used, fair value must be
disclosed.    The fair value at the end of reporting period must be determined for
measurement (if the fair value model is used) or for disclosure (if the cost model
is used).    A gain or loss arising from a change in the fair value of investment
property shall be recognised in profit or loss for the period in which it arises.

1  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly

transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

Other applicable HKFRS

Purpose of holding

7.
HKAS 2 Inventories and HKAS 16 Property, Plant  and Equipment
may also be relevant to a property that is held by an owner apart from HKAS 40.
The  applicability  of  the  standard  (i.e.  HKAS  2,  HKAS  16  or  HKAS  40)  to  a
property would depend on the purposes for which the property is held.

HKAS 2

Property that is held for sale in the ordinary course of business (e.g.
8.
property  acquired  exclusively  with  a  view  to  subsequent  disposal  in  the  near
future or for development and resale) should be accounted for under HKAS 2
and  measured  at  the  lower  of  cost  and  net  realisable  value.    The  carrying
amount of the property should be recognised as an expense in the period when
the property is sold.

HKAS 16

9.
Property that is held for use in the production or supply of goods or
services  or  for  administrative  purposes  (i.e.  owner-occupied  property)  and
expected to be used during more than one period should be accounted as property,
plant  and  equipment  (PPE)  under  HKAS  16  and  measured  initially  at  cost.
After initial recognition, an entity shall choose the cost model or the revaluation
model to measure the entire class of PPE to which that property belongs.    Under
the revaluation model, the carrying amount2  of a property shall be adjusted to
the  revalued  amount 3 .    Any  revaluation  increase  of  a  property  should  be
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the
heading of revaluation surplus, and such increase should be recognised in profit
or  loss  to  the  extent  it  reverses  a  revaluation  decrease  of  the  same  property
previously  recognised  in  profit  or  loss.    Any  revaluation  decrease  should  be
recognised  in  profit  or  loss.    However,  the  decrease  should  be  recognised  in
other comprehensive income to the extent to any credit balance existing in the
revaluation surplus of that property.

2    Carrying amount is the amount at  which a property is recognised after deducting any accumulated

depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

3     Revalued  amount  is  the  fair  value  at  the  date  of  the  revaluation  less  any  subsequent  accumulated

depreciation and subsequent impairment losses.

Relevance of accounting classification for profits tax purposes

Though a property should be recognised and measured in the financial
10.
statements in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles (i.e.
under  HKAS  2,  HKAS  16  or  HKAS  40  as  the  case  may  be),  the  accounting
classification of a property is not decisive in determining whether the property is
a trading stock or capital asset for profits tax purposes.    It is a question of law,
and  all  the  relevant  facts  and  circumstances,  including  the  accounting
classification, have to be taken into consideration.

Example 1

Company-HK held  some properties and land for development at  31
December 2019, including: a factory which was built on its land in
District  X  for  producing  goods;  some  land  in  District  Y  which  it
intended to develop as a residential estate for future sale; and certain
properties under construction in District Z which would be for rental
purposes after completion.

Since  the  factory  in  District  X  was  used  as  a  production  unit  of
Company-HK, the factory should not be an investment property under
HKAS  40  but  an  owner-occupied  property  under  HKAS  16  (i.e.
initially measured at cost and subsequently  measured using the cost
model or the revaluation model).    Given that the land in District Y
would  be  developed  for  sale  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  of
Company-HK, the land should not be an investment property  under
HKAS 40 but should be classified as inventory under HKAS 2 (i.e.
measured  at  the  lower  of  cost  and  net  realisable  value).    Since  the
properties  in  District  Z  were  under  construction  for  future  use  as
investment properties, they should be recognised under HKAS 40 (i.e.
initially measured at cost and subsequently  measured using the cost
model or the fair value model).

Though  Company-HK  would  be  expected  to  apply  the  appropriate
accounting standards to classify the properties and land in its accounts,
such accounting classification would not be decisive in determining
whether the properties are trading stocks or capital assets for profits
tax purposes.

iv

Transactions  that  are  “equivocal”  may  also  be  dual  motive
transactions.    A dual motive transaction is a transaction entered into
with  two  objects  (e.g.  an  acquisition  of  land  both  to  provide
accommodation  for  an  existing  trade  and  for  eventual  development
and  resale  at  profit).    It  would  be  a  question  of  fact  in  such
circumstances whether one of those motives is a trading motive and,
if  so,  to  what  extent  it  colours  the  whole  transaction  as  being,  in
essence, a trading transaction.    Nourse LJ’s comments in Kirkham v
Williams [1991] 64 TC 253 are relevant.

Change in fair value recognised in profit or loss under HKAS 40

11.
If  an  owned  property  is  classified  as  an  investment  property  under
HKAS 40 and the fair value model is applied to measure the investment property,
a change in the fair value (i.e. gain or loss) is to be recognised in profit or loss in
the period in which the gain or loss arises.    If the property is a capital asset, any
gain  or  loss  arising  from  the  change  in  the  fair  value  is  of  capital  nature  and
should be excluded from the computation of assessable profits.    Such gain is
also unrealised and not taxable in accordance with the judgement in Nice Cheer
Investment Ltd v CIR (2013) 16 HKCFAR 813.    If, however, the property is a
trading asset (i.e. acquired or held as trading stock), the cumulative gain or loss
will  be  assessed  or  allowed  in  the  year  in  which  the  property  is  disposed  of.
Commercial or industrial building allowance will not be allowed in respect of
the property.

Transfer to or from investment property

Accounting for transfer

12.
HKAS  40  requires  that  transfers  to,  or  from,  investment  property
should only be made when there is an evidenced change in use of the property.
To  conclude  that  there  is  a  change  in  use,  there  should  be  an  assessment  of
whether  the  property  meets  or  ceases  to  meet  the  definition  of  investment
property.    In accordance with HKAS 40, a change in management’s intention,
in isolation, does not provide evidence of a change in use.    A non-exhaustive
list of examples of evidence of a change in use was provided in the standard as
below:

v

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

an  investment  property  is  transferred  to  an  owner-occupied
property  when  owner-occupation  commences  or
the
investment  property  is  developed  with  a  view  to  owner-
occupation;

an investment property is transferred to inventory at the time of
commencement of development with a view to sale;

an  owner-occupied  property  is  transferred  to  an  investment
property when owner-occupation ends; and

a  property  held  as  inventory  is  transferred  to  an  investment
property when an operating lease to another party commences.

13.
Where the cost model is used for measuring an investment property
and  there  are  transfers  between  investment  property  and  owner-occupied
property/inventories, HKAS 40 specifies that the transfers do not change the
carrying amount of the property transferred and do not change the cost of that
property for measurement purpose.

14.
Where  the  fair  value  model  is  used  for  measuring  an  investment
property  and  there  are  transfers  between  investment  property  and  owner-
occupied  property/inventories,  HKAS  40  specifies  the  measurement  of  the
property at the date of change in use (i.e. date of transfer):

(a)

(b)

If an investment property carried at fair value is transferred to
an  owner-occupied  property  or  inventory,  the  property’s
deemed  cost  for  subsequent  accounting  in  accordance  with
HKAS 16 or HKAS 2 should be the fair value at the date of
change in use.

If an owner-occupied property is transferred to an investment
property carried at fair value, the property should be accounted
for under HKAS 16 up to the date of transfer and the difference
between the carrying amount of the property and the fair value
at  the  date  of  transfer  should  be  recognised  as  revaluation
surplus or deficit in accordance with HKAS 16.

vi

(c)

If  a  property  that  is  held  as  inventory  is  transferred  to  an
investment  property  carried  at  fair  value,  the  difference
between the fair value of the property and its carrying amount
at the date of transfer should be recognised in profit or loss.

Change of intention

15.
It should be emphasised that the accounting treatment of a property
(i.e.  as  an  investment  property,  an  owner-occupied  property  or  inventory)
arising from a transfer as required under HKAS 40 is not decisive for profits
tax purposes.    In determining whether the property in question is a trading stock
or capital asset for profits tax purposes, the intention that existed at the time of
acquisition of the property is important but the intention may be changed (i.e.
an investment may be put into trading stock and vice versa).    Whether there
has been a change of intention is a question of fact which would depend on the
facts and circumstances of each case.    If a change of intention is to be relied
upon  as  the  basis  for  a  finding  of  an  intention  to  trade,  precision  in  the  fact
finding process is required: see Simmons v IRC [1980] 1 WLR 1196.    In other
words, there must be evidence which establishes the change of intention.

Example 2

Company-HK owned Property A which was used as its office for the
past five years.    Property A was all along classified as PPE in the
accounts  of  Company-HK.    During  the  year  ended  31  December
2019, Company-HK moved to another property and leased Property
A  to  a  third  party  for  three  years.    Company-HK  reclassified
Property A to investment property when it moved out of Property A
and owner-occupation ceased.

For accounting purposes, Property A should  be properly recognised
and measured in accordance with HKAS 16 or HKAS 40, as the case
may be.    If Property A was acquired and held by Company-HK as a
capital asset for profits tax purposes, any change in fair value arising
from  the  accounting  reclassification  (i.e.  from  PPE  to  investment
property) would not have any tax consequences.

vii

Example 3

Company-HK  was  engaged  in  property  development  for  sale  and
property  investment  for  rental  purposes.    Property  B,  classified  as
investment property and measured using the fair value model, would
be sold by Company-HK.    Company-HK would redevelop Property
B  before  sale  and  the  redevelopment  works  would  significantly
improve  and  enhance  Property  B.
  Company-HK  transferred
Property  B  from  investment  property  to  inventory  at  the  date  of
commencement of the redevelopment works.

For accounting purposes, Company-HK should classify Property B in
accordance  with  HKAS  2  or  HKAS  40,  as  the  case  may  be,  and
continue  the  classification  unless  there  was  evidence  of  an  actual
change in use in accordance with HKAS 40.    For profits tax purposes,
there should be clear evidence that Property B was a capital asset as
claimed since Company-HK had two lines of business (i.e. property
development  for  sale  and  property  investment  for  rental  purposes).
If  Property  B  was  a  capital  asset  of  Company-HK  (i.e.  not  trading
stock), it would remain a capital asset unless Company-HK changed
its intention to that of trading (i.e. became trading stock).    If Property
B became trading stock of Company-HK, the amount that Property B
would have realised in the open market at the time it became trading
stock  would  be  treated  as  the  cost  of  stock  under  section  15BA(3).
Evidence for establishing the change from a  capital asset  to trading
stock would be required.

Example 4

Company-HK,  a  property  developer  with  a  history  of  developing
properties for sale immediately after completion, constructed multi-
storey residential buildings in District X for sale, and classified such
properties  under  construction  as  inventories  in  its  accounts  for  the
year  ended  31  December  2019.    Given  property  prices  were  at  a
multi-year low, Company-HK decided not to pursue the plan to sell
the property units after completion.    The intended change in use was
evidenced by a formal board decision and a change in Company-HK’s
business plan.

viii

For  accounting  purposes,  Company-HK  should  continue  to  classify
the  properties  as  inventories  unless  there  was  evidence  of  an  actual
change in use in accordance with HKAS 40.    For profits tax purposes,
if the properties held as inventories were appropriated for non-trade
purposes by Company-HK, the amount that the properties would have
realised in the open market at the time of the appropriation would be
brought  into  account  as  a  trading  receipt  under  section  15BA(2).
There would be such an appropriation if the initial intention to trade
was clearly and unequivocally displaced by a subsequent intention not
to  trade:  see  Taylor  v  Good  [1974]  49  TC  277.    If  findings  of  this
kind  were  to  be  made,  precision  would  be  required  for  the  date  of
appropriation.

Appendix 5

Overview of HKAS 2

Scope

1.

HKAS 2 Inventories applies to all inventories, except:

(a)

financial instruments; and

(b)

biological assets related to agricultural activity and agricultural
produce at the point of harvest.

2.

HKAS 2 does not apply to the measurement of inventories held by:

(a)

producers  of  agricultural  and  forest  products,  agricultural
produce after harvest, and minerals and mineral products, to the
extent  that  they  are  measured  at  net  realisable  value  in
accordance with well-established practices in those industries
(such  inventories  are  measured  at  net  realisable  value  and
changes  in  that  value  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  in  the
period of the change);

(b)

commodity broker-traders who measure their inventories at fair
value less costs to sell (such inventories are  measured at fair
value less costs to sell and changes in fair value less costs to
sell are recognised in profit or loss in the period of the change).

Definitions

3.
meanings:

Under  HKAS  2,  the  following  terms  are  used  with  the  following

“inventories” are assets:

(a)

held for sale in the ordinary course of business;

(b)

in the process of production for such sale; or

(c)

in  the  form  of  materials  or  supplies  to  be  consumed  in  the
production process or in the rendering of services.

“net  realisable  value”  is  the  estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary
course  of  business  less  the  estimated  costs  of  completion  and  the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

“fair value” is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market
participants at the measurement date.

4.

The definition of inventories in effect refers to:

(a)

finished goods, being held for sale;

(b)  work-in-progress, being in the process of production;

(c)

raw  materials,  being  those  supplies  to  be  consumed  in  the
production process.

Measurement of inventories

Lower of cost and net realisable value

5.
value.

Inventories shall be measured at the lower of cost and net realisable

Example 1

Company-HK had three major products.    As at 31 December 2019,
the cost of purchase, selling price and estimated cost to sell for each
product were as follows:

Product A
Product B
Product C

Selling price
$
6,000,000
1,200,000
1,000,000

Costs to sell
$
200,000
50,000
40,000

Cost
$
4,000,000
1,200,000
800,000

ii

The closing inventory of Company-HK as at 31 December 2019 had
to be measured on a product line basis, and at the lower of cost and
net realisable value.    The net realisable value for each product would
be the selling price net of any estimated  costs of sale.    Products A
and C would be measured at cost while Product B would be measured
at net realisable value of $1,150,000 (i.e. $1,200,000 - $50,000).

Cost of inventories

6.

The cost of inventories shall comprise all:

(a)

costs of purchase1;

(b)

costs of conversion2; and

(c)

other costs incurred3

in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.

Example 2

Company-HK was a manufacturer of television components A and B.
The  budgeted  outputs  for  Components  A  and  B  for  December  2019
were  20,000  units  and  12,000  units  respectively.    Company-HK
incurred  direct  cost  of  $3,840,000
for  Component  B  and
unidentifiable  indirect  production  overheads  of  $800,000  for  both
components.    Total units of 20,000 and 12,000 of Components A and
B  were  produced  in  December  2019.    Due  to  technical  defects  for
Component  B,  1,500  units  were  scrapped  at  zero  value  and  only
10,500 units were taken into inventory.    The respective selling prices
of  Components  A  and  B  were  $5,500  and  $4,500  respectively.

1   Costs  of  purchase  may  include  all  of:  purchase  price;  import  duties  and  other  irrecoverable  taxes;
transport, handling and any other cost directly attributable to the acquisition of finished goods, services
and  materials.    Trade  discounts,  rebates  and  other  similar  amounts  are  deducted  from  costs  of
purchase.

2   Costs  of  conversion  includes:  costs  directly  related  to  the  units  of  production;  and  a  systematic
allocation of fixed and variable production overheads that are incurred in converting materials into
finished goods.

3   Other  costs  are  costs  incurred  in  bringing  the  inventories  to  their  present  location  and  condition.
Abnormal wastage, storage costs, administrative overheads and selling costs would not be included in
cost of inventories but should be recognised as an expense in the period they are incurred.

iii

Company-HK closed its accounts on 31 December each year.

The cost of Component B included direct cost of $3,840,000 and an
allocated  portion  of  indirect  production  overheads  of  $800,000.
Based  on  the  ratio  of  the  units  produced  of  the  two  components,
indirect production overheads of $300,000 (i.e. $800,000 × 12,000  ÷
32,000) would be allocated to Component B.    The cost  per unit  of
Component  B  was  $345  (i.e.  ($3,840,000  +  $300,000)  ÷  12,000).
Company-HK  would  be  required  to  recognise  $3,622,500  ($345  ×
10,500)  as  cost  of  inventory  and  $517,500  ($345  ×  1,500)  as  an
expense for the year of assessment 2019/20.

Cost formulas

7.
The cost of inventories of items that are not ordinarily interchangeable
and  goods  or  services  produced  and  segregated  for  specific  projects  shall  be
assigned by using specific identification of their individual costs.

8.
The  cost  of  inventories,  other  than  those  dealt  with  in  paragraph  7,
shall be assigned by using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or weighted average cost
formula.    Under the weighted average cost formula, a recalculation of cost can
be made after each purchase, or alternatively only at the period end.    An entity
shall use the same cost formula for all inventories having a similar nature and
use to the entity.    For inventories with a different nature or use, different cost
formulas may be justified.

Recognition as an expense

9.
When inventories are sold, the carrying amount of those inventories
shall be recognised as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is
recognised.    The  amount  of  any  write-down  of  inventories  to  net  realisable
value and all losses of inventories shall be recognised as an expense in the period
the write-down or loss occurs.    The amount of any reversal of any write-down
of  inventories,  arising  from  an  increase  in  net  realisable  value,  shall  be
recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an expense
in the period in which the reversal occurs.

iv

Techniques for the measurement of cost

Techniques  for  the  measurement  of  the  cost  of  inventories  may  be
10.
used  for  convenience  if  the  results  approximate  cost.    HKAS  2  allows  the
following for the measurement of cost of inventories:

(a)

(b)

standard  costs,  which  take  into  account  normal  levels  of
materials  and  supplies,  labour,  efficiency  and  capacity
utilisation.    They  are  regularly  reviewed  and,  if  necessary,
revised in the light of current conditions.

the retail method, which is often used in the retail industry for
measuring  inventories  of  large  numbers  of  rapidly  changing
items with similar margins for which it is impracticable to use
other  costing  methods.
  The  cost  of  the  inventory  is
determined by reducing the sales value of the inventory by the
appropriate  percentage  gross  margin.    The  percentage  used
takes into consideration inventory that has been marked down
to below its original selling price.    An average percentage for
each retail department is often used.
