INTRODUCTION

Hong  Kong  has  entered  into  a  number  of  Double  Taxation
Agreements (DTAs) with other tax jurisdictions.  One of the main purposes of
such  agreements  is  the  avoidance  of  double  taxation.    This  Departmental
Interpretation and Practice Note sets out the Department’s views and practices
on  granting  relief  from  double  taxation  due  to  a  transfer  pricing  or  profit
reallocation adjustment under a DTA.

Types of international double taxation

Generally, two types of international double taxation are recognised

2.
in the context of DTAs:

(a)

economic double taxation; and

(b)

juridical double taxation.

3.
Economic  double  taxation  arises  where  two  enterprises  resident  in
different states are assessed to tax on the same profit or income, without relief
provided  by  either  state  for  tax  imposed  by  the  other.    This  double  taxation
may arise as a consequence of non-arm’s length transactions.  The profits of
one  enterprise  are  adjusted  upwards  increasing  the  tax  charged  on  that
enterprise  in  one  state  (i.e.  a  primary  transfer  pricing  adjustment),  without  a
corresponding  downward  adjustment  to  the  tax  payable  of  the  associated
enterprise in the other state.

Juridical double taxation occurs where an enterprise is charged to tax
4.
on the same profit or income in two different states  (e.g.  a  single  legal  entity
having  a  head  office  in  its  state  of  residence  has  set  up  a  permanent
establishment  in  another  state),  without  either  state  providing  relief  for  tax
imposed  by  the  other.  This  double  taxation  may  arise  where  the  profits  that
are taken to have arisen from the enterprise’s operations in a state are adjusted
upwards  to  increase  the  tax  payable  in  that  state  (i.e.  a  primary  profit
reallocation adjustment) without a corresponding downward adjustment to the
enterprise’s profits from its operations in the other state.

In  each  of  the  DTAs  of  the  Hong  Kong  SAR,  the  Associated
5.
Enterprises  Article,  which  is  modeled  on  Article  9  of  the  OECD  Model  Tax
Convention  on  Income  and  on  Capital  (the  OECD  Model),  provides  for
primary  transfer  pricing  adjustments  by  a  DTA  state.    The  Associated
Enterprises  Article  also  provides  a  mechanism  for  relief  from  the  resultant
economic double taxation to be given by the other DTA state.

6.
The  Business  Profits  Article  and  the  Methods  for  Elimination  of
Double  Taxation  Article,  which  are  modeled  on  Article  7  and  Article  23
respectively of the OECD Model, in each of the DTAs of the Hong Kong SAR
provide  for  both  primary  profit  reallocation  adjustments  and  relief  from  the
resultant juridical double taxation.

7.
Each  of  the  DTAs  of  the  Hong  Kong  SAR  contains  a  Mutual
Agreement  Procedure  Article,  which  is  modeled  on  Article  25  of  the  OECD
Model, that provides, inter alia, for the resolution of cases where a taxpayer is
In  that  article,  double  taxation  is
faced  with  international  double  taxation.
usually regarded as “taxation not in accordance” with the DTA.    The Mutual
Agreement  Procedure  Article  enables  the  competent  authorities,  which  in  the
case  of  the  Hong  Kong  SAR  is  the  Commissioner  of  Inland  Revenue  (the
Commissioner),  to  consult  with  each  other  with  a  view  to  resolving  double
taxation  though  it  does  not  compel  agreement.    Paragraph  37  of  the
Commentary  on  Article  25  of  the  OECD  Model,  which  is  relevant  to
interpreting the Mutual Agreement Procedure Article, states:

“Paragraph 2 (of Article 25) no doubt entails a duty to negotiate; but
as  far  as  reaching  mutual  agreement  through  the  procedure  is
concerned, the competent authorities are under a duty merely to use
their best endeavours and not to achieve a result ...”

Where no double tax agreement exists

8.
Where either the Commissioner or the tax administration of another
state makes a transfer pricing or profit reallocation adjustment and no relevant
DTA exists, no bilateral procedures are in place.  Accordingly, the question of
any relief from the resultant double taxation does not arise.

2

Transfer pricing adjustment by a non-DTA state

Where  economic  double  taxation  arises  from  a  transfer  pricing
9.
adjustment made by the tax administration of a non-DTA state to increase the
taxable  income  of  an  associated  enterprise,  there  are  no  provisions  under  the
Inland Revenue Ordinance (the IRO) permitting:

(a)

the  profit  which  has  been  derived  by  the  Hong  Kong
enterprise1   to be treated as not derived; or

(b)

a deduction to be allowed to the Hong Kong enterprise where
no expenditure has been incurred.

10.
In  these  circumstances,  the  foreign  tax  paid  is  a  liability  of  the
associated  enterprise  in  the  other  state.  The  adjustment  does  not  affect  the
profits of the Hong Kong enterprise, and therefore no adjustment can be made
to the profits of the Hong Kong enterprise.

11.
Where  juridical  double  taxation  arises  for  a  Hong  Kong  enterprise
that is subject to a profit reallocation adjustment made by a non-DTA state, the
profit  which  has  been  subject  to  double  taxation  will  not  be  excluded  from
taxation in Hong Kong because the profit has been properly assessed to profits
tax as Hong Kong sourced profits.  Neither can relief by way of a tax credit be
provided under section 50 of the IRO in the absence of a DTA.

The permanent  establishment of a non-resident enterprise is subject
12.
to profits tax in Hong Kong on profits sourced in Hong Kong and expenses are
not deductible if they are attributable to profits that are sourced outside Hong
Kong.  Any relief from double taxation can only be provided by the non-DTA
state.

13.
Where the Assessor finds a Hong Kong enterprise or the permanent
establishment  of  a  non-resident  enterprise  has  been  assessed  at  less  than  the
proper amount because transfer prices are not structured at arm’s length, he can
raise  an  additional  assessment  under  section  60  of  the  IRO.  The  basis  on

1

In  a  DTA  entered  into  by  the  Hong  Kong  SAR,  a  “Hong  Kong  enterprise”  typically  means  an
enterprise  carried  on  by  a  resident  of  Hong  Kong.    The  term  “Hong  Kong  resident”  is  also
categorically defined in the relevant DTA, depending on whether it is an individual, a corporation or
other legally constituted person.

3

which  transfer  pricing  adjustments  are  to  be  made  is  explained  in  another
Departmental Interpretation and Practice Note.

ECONOMIC DOUBLE TAXATION

Transfer pricing adjustment by a DTA state

Where  the  Commissioner  agrees  with  a  DTA  state  that  the  transfer
14.
pricing  adjustment  by  it  is  correct  both  in  principle  and  amount,  the  relevant
assessment of the Hong Kong enterprise will be revised in accordance with the
relief provision in the Associated Enterprises Article of the DTA and section 79
of  the  IRO  to  refund  the  excess  tax  paid  or  to  reduce  the  tax  that  would
otherwise be payable on the assessable profits of the Hong Kong enterprise.

15.
Regarding  a  transfer  pricing  adjustment  to  an  associated  enterprise
made  by  the  tax  administration  of  a  DTA state,  the  claim  for  an  “appropriate
adjustment  to  the  amount  of  tax  charged”  must  be  made  by  the  Hong  Kong
enterprise under section 79 of the IRO within 6 years of the end of the relevant
year of assessment.

16.
The Commissioner is only obligated to provide relief from economic
double  taxation  if  the  primary  transfer  pricing  adjustment  is  made  in
accordance with the relevant DTA (i.e. by the application of the arm’s length
principle).  Paragraph 6 of the Commentary on Article 9 of the OECD Model
makes  it  clear  that  this  is  the  result  intended.  Paragraph  4.35  of  the  OECD
Transfer  Pricing  Guidelines
for  Multinational  Enterprises  and  Tax
Administrations states:

“Corresponding  adjustments  are  not  mandatory,  mirroring  the  rule
that  tax  administrations  are  not  required  to  reach  agreement  under
the mutual agreement procedure.  Under paragraph 2 of Article 9, a
tax  administration  should  make  a  corresponding  adjustment  only
insofar as it considers the primary adjustment to be justified both in
principle and in amount.”

4

Example 1

Company  F  is  resident  in  Country  F,  a  DTA  state,  and  provided
goods for no consideration to its wholly owned subsidiary, Company
HK,  a  company  resident  in  Hong  Kong.    Country  F  subjected
Company F to tax audit and increased the profits of Company F by
$100,000  on  the  basis  that  if  Company  F  and  Company  HK  had
transacted with each other on an arm’s length basis, Company HK
would have paid Company F $100,000 for the goods.

The resultant economic double taxation may be relieved by:

(a)

(b)

the  Commissioner  agreeing  that  $100,000  reflects  an  arm’s
length  price  and  reduces  the  tax  payable  by  Company  HK
accordingly (i.e. reduce $16,500 of tax if the profits tax rate is
16.5 per cent); or

the  tax  administration  of  Country  F  being  convinced  that  its
adjustment is incorrect and accordingly reduces the additional
tax  payable  by  Company  F  (e.g.  through  domestic  review,
objection or appeal processes in Country F); or

(c)

the reaching of agreement between both competent authorities
under  the  Mutual  Agreement  Procedure  Article  of  the
relevant DTA.

17.
Relief  for  economic  double  taxation  arising  from  a  transfer  pricing
adjustment  can  only  be  provided  under  the  combined  effect  of  the  DTA  and
section  79  of  the  IRO.  Section  50  of  the  IRO  deals  with  profits  derived  by
Hong Kong enterprises and addresses juridical double taxation by providing tax
credits for tax imposed by the other DTA state (see paragraphs 36 to 51 below).

The  following  examples  illustrate  how  appropriate  adjustments  are

18.
made:

5

Example 2

Company  HK  resident  in  Hong  Kong  purchased  goods  from
Company  F  resident  in  a  DTA  state  and  paid  $200,000  for  goods
that  had  an  arm’s  length  price  of  $300,000.    After  the  tax
administration  in  Country  F  had  made  an  upward  transfer  pricing
adjustment,  Company  F  paid  an  extra  $50,000  income  tax  in
Country F where the tax rate was 50 per cent.

Company HK’s assessable profits would have been $100,000 less if
it  had  paid  the  arm’s  length  price.    The  appropriate  adjustment
would be a $16,500 reduction in the profits tax payable of Company
HK if the profits tax rate is 16.5 per cent.

Example 3

Company HK resident in Hong Kong supplied goods to Company F
resident  in  Country  F,  a  DTA  state,  for  $400,000.
  The  tax
administration of Country F determined that the arm’s length price
should  be  $200,000.    The  taxable  profits  of  Company  F  were
increased  by  $200,000  because  Company  F  would  not  have  been
entitled to deduct this amount if it had transacted on an arm’s length
basis  with  Company  HK.  Company  F  paid  an  extra  $100,000  tax
in Country F where the tax rate was 50 per cent.

The  assessable  profits  of  Company  HK  would  have  been  $200,000
less  if  it  had  supplied  the  goods  for  arm’s  length  price.    The
appropriate  adjustment  would  be  a  $33,000  reduction  in  the  profits
tax  payable  of  Company  HK  if  the  Hong  Kong  profits  tax  rate  is
16.5 per cent.

Example 4

Company F resident in the Mainland, a DTA jurisdiction, provided a
licence over a patent to Company HK resident in Hong Kong at an
annual royalty rate of $50,000.  The patent has not been owned at
any time by any person carrying on a trade, profession or business
in Hong Kong (i.e. section 21A(a) of the IRO does not apply).  The

6

tax  authorities  made  a  primary

transfer  pricing
Mainland
adjustment  to  increase  the  royalty  by  $100,000  because  the  arm’s
length amount would equal $150,000.    The Commissioner agrees to
such  an  upward  adjustment  as  being  correct  in  principle  and
amount.

The  Commissioner  would  make  an  appropriate  downward
adjustment of $100,000 under Article 9(2) to reduce Company HK’s
profits,  and  increase  the  royalty  received  by  Company  F  by
$100,000.  Under Article 12 of the DTA with the Mainland and the
IRO, any royalty arising from Hong Kong is subject to a withholding
tax rate of 7 or 4.95 per cent (i.e. 16.5 per cent of 30 per cent under
section 21A of the IRO, assuming the profits tax rate to be 16.5 per
cent),  whichever  is  the  lower.  The  lower  rate  of  4.95  per  cent  is
therefore  applicable  to  the  royalty  received  by  Company  F.
Company  F’s  liability  to  withholding  tax  under  section  20B  and
Article 12 would have been $7,425 (i.e. 4.95 per cent of $150,000) if
the  transaction  had  been  structured  on  an  arm’s  length  basis.
Company  F’s  additional  tax  liability  would  be  $4,950  (i.e.  $7,425
less  $2,475  paid  earlier  on  $50,000).  Company  HK  is  required  to
deduct  and  forward  that  additional  amount  to  the  Commissioner
under section 20B.

19.
If  a  DTA  does  not  contain  a  provision  specifically  directed  at  the
relief  of  economic  double  taxation,  the  Commissioner  does  not  consider  that
there is an obligation to provide relief from economic double taxation.

Appropriate adjustment of tax charged

20.
The DTAs of the Hong Kong SAR are to avoid double taxation and
prevent fiscal evasion.  The language of the DTAs permits a relief from actual
double taxation in respect of “tax charged” or “tax paid” in a DTA state.

The  Associated  Enterprises  Article  requires  that  tax  has  been
21.
charged  on  the  same  profits  by  the  two  DTA  states  before  an  appropriate
adjustment  can  be  considered.  The  expressions  “taxes  accordingly”  and
“charged to tax” used in the context of the article clearly envisage liabilities to
tax to be actually in existence or arising in both tax jurisdictions in respect of
the adjusted profit.

7

This  means  actual  double  taxation  does  not  arise  while  one  of  the
22.
associated enterprises is, or both are, in a loss position.  Double taxation will
arise at a later stage when the enterprise concerned returns to profit and relief
may be provided at that time.  The provision of relief will depend on the facts
of each case.

Example 5

Company F is resident in Country F, a DTA state, and it transferred
goods  for  no  consideration  to  Company  HK,  a  wholly  owned
subsidiary  company  resident  in  Hong  Kong.  Country  F  subjected
Company F to tax audit and increased its profits by $100,000 on the
basis that if Company F and Company HK had transacted with each
other  on  an  arm’s  length  basis,  Company  HK  would  have  paid
$100,000 for the goods.  Company F had a loss of $300,000 prior
to the transfer pricing adjustment.  Company F returned a profit of
$300,000  for  the  next  year,  offset  by  loss  of  $200,000  brought
forward and paid income tax on $100,000.

The  transfer  pricing  adjustment  resulted  in  a  reduction  of  the  loss
carried  forward  by  Company  F  from  $300,000  to  $200,000.    No
relief could be made to Company HK in the first year.  A relief of
$16,500  could  be  provided  to  Company  HK  in  the  second  year,
being tax on $100,000 if the tax rate is 16.5 per cent, by making an
appropriate  adjustment.    Equally,  if  the  Hong  Kong  enterprise  had
been  in  a  loss  position,  an  appropriate  adjustment  could  not  have
been  made  until  it  returns  to  a  profit  position  in  a  later  year.
In
such a case, the claim under section 79 for an appropriate adjustment
should be made within 6 years of the end of the year of assessment
in which it returns to a profit position.

Retrospective adjustment

Hong  Kong  enterprises  should  not  seek  to  relieve  economic  double
23.
taxation  by  claiming  deductions  under  section  16  for  subsequent  payments
purporting  to  represent  a  retrospective  adjustment  to  transactions  previously
undertaken with an associated enterprise in another state.

8

The  payments  did  not  represent  outgoings  and  expenses  incurred
24.
under section 16 in the production of profits chargeable to profits tax and are
therefore not tax deductible.  Nor can the retrospective adjustment be accepted
as error or omission in terms of section 70A.

Relief  from  or  resolution  of  economic  double  taxation  must  be
25.
sought by presentation of the case to the Commissioner under section 79 and/or
under the Mutual Agreement Procedure Article of the relevant DTA.

Deemed dividend

The Commissioner will not accept a sum as a non-taxable dividend
26.
even if the tax administration of a DTA state treats the profits shifted to a Hong
Kong enterprise to be a “deemed dividend”.  These circumstances arise where
that  tax  administration  considers  that  profits  have  been  transferred  to  an
associated enterprise resident in Hong Kong and deems for its tax purposes the
increased consideration to be a “dividend” paid by the foreign enterprise to the
Hong Kong enterprise.

The  exemption  under  section  26(a)  of  the  IRO  only  applies  to
27.
dividends for the purposes of the domestic law.    This means that an exemption
cannot  be  claimed  for  profits  received  by  a  Hong  Kong  enterprise  which  is  a
“deemed dividend” under the law of another state but not under the laws of the
Hong Kong SAR.

The  nature  of  the  sum  accrued  to  the  Hong  Kong  enterprise  would
28.
remain unchanged.  A trading receipt will continue to be assessed as a trading
receipt under the IRO though it is deemed by the tax administration of a DTA
state as dividend paid to the Hong Kong enterprise.

Transfer pricing adjustment by the Commissioner

If  the  Commissioner  makes  a  transfer  pricing  upward  adjustment
29.
under the Associated Enterprises Article and/or the provisions of the IRO, it is
up  to  the  associated  enterprise  of  the  DTA  state  to  seek  relief  from  the  tax
administration  of  that  state  in  respect  of  the  adjustment  made  on  the  Hong
Kong enterprise.  The Commissioner will be ready to demonstrate on request
to  the  competent  authority  of  the  DTA  state  that  the  adjustment  made  is  in
accordance with the DTA.

9

The  mechanism  to  be  used  in  a  DTA  state  to  relieve  economic

30.
double taxation is a matter for the tax administration of that state.

Losses

The  Commissioner’s  view  on  relief  from  economic  double  taxation
31.
where one of the associated enterprises is, or both are, in a loss position is set
out  in  paragraphs  20  to  22  above.  A  DTA  state  may  arrive  at  a  different
interpretation of a relevant DTA or may have provisions in their domestic laws
that  enable  a  different  approach  to  be  taken  (e.g.  restoring  income  and
deductions to what they would have been had the transactions been undertaken
on an arm’s length basis in the first place).

Exchange of information

32.
To enable a DTA state to give effect to its relevant DTA obligations
and  general  domestic  law  provisions,  the  Commissioner  will,  on  request,
exchange information about any transfer pricing adjustment with the competent
authority of a DTA state.  This exchange will be made under the Exchange of
Information Article of the relevant DTA.

Withholding taxes

33.
The  basis  upon  which  the  tax  administration  of  a  DTA  state  will
calculate  the  appropriate  amount  of  tax  relief  from  withholding  taxes  and  the
mechanisms  for  the  provision  of  relief  from  economic  double  taxation  in
equivalent circumstances are matters for determination by that administration.

34.
Where withholding taxes have been paid (e.g. where royalty is paid
to a Hong Kong enterprise giving rise to a liability and payment of withholding
tax  by  the  Hong  Kong  enterprise  in  the  source  state),  a  tax  credit  would  be
available  under  section  50  for  the  foreign  withholding  tax  paid  if  the  same
profit is subject to profits tax in the Hong Kong SAR.

35.
If the Commissioner makes an adjustment pursuant to the IRO and/
or the relevant DTA to increase the quantum of the royalty or income deemed
to have been received by the Hong Kong enterprise, the basis upon which the
tax administration of a DTA state will compute the appropriate amount of tax

10

relief  and  the  mechanisms  for  the  provision  of  relief  from  economic  double
taxation are matters for determination by that tax administration and subject to
the provisions of the relevant DTA.

JURIDICAL DOUBLE TAXATION

Profit reallocation by a DTA state

36.
Profits  of  a  Hong  Kong  enterprise  properly  assessed  under  section
14  as  profits  arising  in  or  derived  from  Hong  Kong  might  be  regarded  by
another  DTA  state  as  profits  sourced  within  its  jurisdiction  under  the  DTA.
Juridical double taxation suffered by a Hong Kong enterprise arising from the
application of the domestic tax law of the source DTA state can be relieved by
way of a tax credit under section 50 of the IRO for the foreign tax paid.  Any
claim for allowance by way of tax credit must be made not later than 2 years
after the end of the relevant year of assessment.

37.
The DTAs of the Hong Kong SAR permit the DTA state in which a
Hong  Kong  enterprise  carries  on  business  through  a  permanent  establishment
to tax the profits “attributable to the permanent establishment”.    These profits
are often deemed to be profits from sources in that state under foreign domestic
law.

38.
Where a DTA state exercises the right to tax the profits of the Hong
Kong  enterprise  in  accordance  with  the  Business  Profits  Article,  the
Commissioner will provide relief from the resultant double taxation if the same
profits  have  been  subject  to  profits  tax  in  the  Hong  Kong  SAR.    The
obligation  to  provide  relief  is  contained  in  the  Methods  for  Elimination  of
Double Taxation Article.

39.
The Business Profits Article also requires a DTA state to apply the
same  principle  in  attributing  profits  to  a  permanent  establishment  (i.e.  “there
shall  in  each  Contracting  State  be  attributed  to  that  permanent  establishment
the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate
enterprise ...”).    The mutual application of this principle ensures:

11

(a)

the  appropriate  exercise  of  the  source  state’s  taxing  rights;
and

(b)

the provision of appropriate relief by the residence state.

The Mutual Agreement Procedure Article in the DTAs of the Hong
40.
Kong  SAR  can  be  used  to  facilitate  agreement  where  DTA  states  differ  on
profit  allocations  under  the  Business  Profits  Article  (i.e.  where  a  Hong  Kong
enterprise  considers  that  it  has  been  taxed  not  in  accordance  with  a  relevant
DTA),  though  the  Mutual  Agreement  Procedure  Article  does  not  compel
agreement.

Adjustment by foreign tax administration

The tax administration of a DTA state may make a profit reallocation

41.
adjustment to:

(a)

a  Hong  Kong  enterprise  carrying  on  business  through  a
permanent establishment in the DTA state; or

(b)

an  enterprise  resident  in  the  DTA  state  carrying  on  business
through a permanent establishment in Hong Kong.

42.

The DTA state may in relation to a Hong Kong enterprise:

(a)  	 make  a  profit  reallocation  adjustment  upon  a  factual  finding
that a permanent establishment of the enterprise existed or did
not  exist  in  that  state,  where  the  enterprise  previously
maintained a different opinion; or

(b)

adjust the amount of profits considered to be attributable to a
permanent establishment of the enterprise in that state.

The Commissioner will provide relief from juridical double taxation only to the
extent that the Commissioner agrees both in principle and in amount with the
profit reallocation adjustment made by the DTA state.

12

Example 6

Company  HK  is  a  Hong  Kong  enterprise  subject  to  profits  tax  in
Hong  Kong.
It  carries  on  business  in  Country  F,  a  DTA  state,
through  a  permanent  establishment.    Company  HK  lodged  tax
returns in both Hong Kong and Country F, returning a profit for tax
purposes  of  $10  million  in  Hong  Kong,  of  which  $3  million  was
attributable  to  the  permanent  establishment  in  Country  F  and  $7
million was profit sourced in Hong Kong under Hong Kong tax laws.
The  tax  administration  of  Country  F  subsequently  audited  the  tax
return  of
that
non-arm’s  length  transactions  between  the  Hong  Kong  head  office
and the permanent establishment had resulted in an understatement
of  the  profits  attributable  to  the  permanent  establishment.  Country
F’s  tax  administration  concluded  that  the  profits  of  the  permanent
establishment should have been $4 million and deemed those profits
to  have  been  derived  in  Country  F.    Country  F  accordingly
reallocated an additional $1 million of Company HK’s profits to the
permanent establishment, making a total of $4 million attributable to
it and imposed additional tax on Company HK.

the  permanent  establishment,  and  determined

The resultant juridical double taxation may be relieved by:

(a)

(b)

the  Commissioner  agreeing  that  the  profit  attributable  to  the
permanent  establishment  in  Country  F  should  have  been  $4
million  and  allowing  a  tax  credit  for  the  additional  foreign
taxes paid; or

the  tax  administration  of  Country  F  being  convinced  that  its
adjustment is incorrect and accordingly reduces the additional
tax payable (e.g. through domestic review, objection or appeal
processes in Country F); or

(c)

the reaching of agreement between both competent authorities
(e.g.  under  the  Mutual  Agreement  Procedure  Article  of  the
relevant DTA).

13

The  provisions  that  give  effect  to  the  obligation  to  provide  relief
43.
from  juridical  double  taxation  under  the  Methods  for  Elimination  of  Double
Taxation Article in DTAs are contained in section 50 of the IRO.

Under section 50, an entitlement to a tax credit for foreign tax arises

44.
where:

(a)

the  assessable  profits  of  a  Hong  Kong  enterprise  includes
profits subject to income taxation in a DTA state; and

(b)

the Hong Kong enterprise has  foreign  tax  paid  or  payable  in
respect of the same profits, being tax for which it was liable.

45.
Where  a  DTA  state  has  imposed  tax  in  contravention  of  the  DTA,
the  Commissioner  is  not  under  any  obligation  to  provide  a  tax  credit  for  the
additional foreign tax paid under section 50.

46.
Juridical double taxation may occur where a non-resident enterprise
that carries on a business through a permanent establishment in Hong Kong is
subject to an adjustment by a foreign tax administration.

Example 7

Company  F  is  resident  in  Country  F,  a  DTA  state,  and  lodged  tax
returns in both Hong Kong and Country F and declared profits for
tax purposes of $10 million of which $2 million was attributable to
the permanent establishment in Hong Kong.    The tax administration
of  Country  F  subjected  Company  F  to  audit  and  determined  that
non-arm’s length dealings between the head office in Country F and
the  permanent  establishment  in  Hong  Kong  had  resulted  in  an
the  permanent

establishment.  The profits of the permanent establishment in Hong
Kong were accordingly reduced to $1 million.  Assuming Country F
has a tax credit system it would then disallow credits for Hong Kong
profits  tax  paid  on  $1  million,  or  if  it  had  an  exemption  system,
Country F would reduce the amount of Company F’s exempt income
to $1 million.

The resultant juridical double taxation may be relieved by:

(a)

(b)

the  Commissioner  agreeing  that  the  profits  of  the  permanent
establishment  should  have  been  $1  million  and  reducing  the
tax payable of the permanent establishment by $165,000 if the
profits tax rate is 16.5 per cent; or

the  tax  administration  of  Country  F  being  convinced  that  its
adjustment is incorrect and accordingly reduces the additional
tax  payable  by  Company  F  (e.g.  through  domestic  review,
objection or appeal processes in Country F); or

(c)

an  agreement  is  reached  between  both  competent  authorities
(e.g. under  the  Mutual  Agreement  Procedure  Article  of  the
relevant DTA).

An adjustment will be made to relieve juridical double taxation only
47.
if the Commissioner regards the reallocated profits as properly not attributable
to the permanent establishment in Hong Kong.  A refund will be made to the
non-resident  enterprise  by  revising  the  relevant  assessment  made  under  the
Business Profits Article and section 79.  A claim under section 79 of the IRO
must be made within 6 years of the end of the relevant year of assessment.

Adjustment by the Commissioner

The  Commissioner  may  make  a  profit  reallocation  adjustment

48.
pursuant to the IRO and/or the relevant DTA to either:

(a)

a Hong Kong enterprise with a permanent establishment in a
DTA state; or

(b)

a  non-resident  enterprise  with  a  permanent  establishment  in
Hong Kong.

authority of the DTA state that the adjustment is in accordance with the DTA

is  made  by

15

so that relief from any resultant double taxation will be provided by the DTA
state.

50.
Juridical double taxation may arise where the Commissioner reduces
the amount of profits of a Hong Kong enterprise attributable to its carrying on
of business through a permanent establishment in the DTA state.

Example 8

Company  HK  is  resident  in  Hong  Kong  and  carries  on  business
through  a  permanent  establishment  in  Country  F,  a  DTA  state.
Company HK lodged tax returns in both Hong Kong and Country F,
declaring profits for Hong Kong profits tax purposes of $10 million,
of  which  $3  million  was  considered  attributable  to  the  permanent
establishment  in  Country  F.  Country  F  assessed  to  income  tax
Company HK on the $3 million.  The Commissioner audited the tax
return  of  Company  HK  and  determined  that  the  profits  attributable
to
the  permanent  establishment  were  overstated  because  of
non-arm’s  length  transactions  between  the  Hong  Kong  head  office
and  the  permanent  establishment.    The  Commissioner  concluded
that the profits attributable to the permanent establishment should be
$2  million  instead  of  $3  million.  The  Commissioner  accordingly
made  a  profit  reallocation  adjustment  reducing  Company  HK’s
offshore profits derived from Country F from $3 million to $2 million.
This resulted in an additional assessment with an assessable profit of
$1 million.

The resultant juridical double taxation may be relieved by:

(a)

the  tax  administration  of  Country  F  agreeing  with  the
taxes
Commissioner’s
accordingly; or

reallocation

reducing

and

its

(b)

domestic objection or appeal processes in Hong Kong finding
the Commissioner’s adjustment to be incorrect; or

16

(c)

the  reaching  of  an  agreement  between  both  competent
authorities  (e.g.  under  the  Mutual  Agreement  Procedure
Article of the relevant DTA).

51.
Juridical  double  taxation  may  arise  where  the  Commissioner
increases the amount of profits considered as being attributable to the business
carried  on  by  a  non-resident  enterprise  through  a  permanent  establishment  in
Hong Kong.

Example 9

Company F is a company resident in Country F which is a DTA state.
It  carries  on  business  through  a  permanent  establishment  in  Hong
Kong.  Company  F  declared  profits  of  $12  million,  of  which  $2
million  were  considered  as  being  attributable  to  the  permanent
establishment  in  Hong  Kong.  Company  F  returned  an  assessable
profit of $2 million for Hong Kong profits tax purposes.  The laws
of  Country  F  might  either  provide  for  an  exemption  of  the  profits
attributable to the permanent establishment in Hong Kong or tax the
worldwide  profits  of  Company  F  with  a  credit  given  for  the  Hong
Kong  profits  tax  paid.  The  Commissioner  audited  the  tax  return  of
Company  F  and  determined  that  the  profits  attributable  to  the
permanent establishment in Hong Kong were understated because of
non-arm’s length transactions between the head office and the Hong
Kong  permanent  establishment.  The  Commissioner  concluded  that
the profits attributable to the permanent establishment in Hong Kong
should  be  $5  million  instead  of  $2  million.    The  Commissioner
accordingly  made  a  profit  reallocation  adjustment,  increasing
Company  F’s  Hong  Kong  assessable  profits  from  $2  million  to  $5
million.
This  resulted  in  an  additional  assessment  with  an
assessable profit of $3 million.

The resultant juridical double taxation may be relieved by:

(a)

reallocation

the  tax  administration  of  Country  F  agreeing  with  the
Commissioner’s
taxes
accordingly (e.g. by way of a credit for Hong Kong profits tax
paid or an exemption for profits attributable to the permanent
establishment in Hong Kong); or

reducing

and

its

17

(b)

domestic objection or appeal processes in Hong Kong finding
the Commissioner’s adjustment to be incorrect; or

(c)

the  reaching  of  an  agreement  between  both  competent
authorities  (e.g.  under  the  Mutual  Agreement  Procedure
Article of the relevant DTA).

TAXATION NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DTA

The Mutual Agreement Procedure

52.
The Mutual Agreement Procedure Article in the DTAs of the Hong
Kong SAR enables a taxpayer to initiate the procedure where it is considered
that  the  actions  of  the  competent  authority  of  one  or  both  of  the  states
concerned result or will result in taxation not in accordance with the provisions
of a DTA.

53.
Taxation  not  in  accordance  with  a  DTA  can  arise  in  various
situations, including transfer pricing and profit reallocation adjustments.  This
Departmental Interpretation and Practice Note only addresses the operation of
the  Mutual  Agreement  Procedure  Article  in  the  context  of  transfer  pricing  or
profit reallocation adjustments.

54.
There are two stages to the Mutual Agreement Procedure.    The first
stage involves the taxpayer and the competent authority of its residence state.
The second stage involves the endeavours of the competent authorities of both
states to resolve the case.

55.

The first stage has three elements:

(a)

the  presentation  of  a  case  by  the  taxpayer  to  the  competent
authority of its residence state;

(b)

consideration  by  the  competent  authority  whether  the  case
presented is justified; and

18

(c)

consideration by the competent authority whether it is able to
arrive at a satisfactory solution itself.

56.
If  the  case  cannot  be  resolved  at  the  first  stage,  the  competent
authority  has  an  obligation  to  endeavour  to  resolve  the  case  by  mutual
agreement with the competent authority of the other DTA state.

Stage 1 - Presentation of case

57.
The Mutual Agreement Procedure Article of the DTAs of the Hong
Kong  SAR  provides  for  the  taxpayer  to  present  its  case  to  the  competent
authority of the DTA state of which it is a resident.  The address of the Hong
Kong SAR competent authority for presenting a case is:

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue
Inland Revenue Department
Revenue Tower,
5 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, China

When  presenting  a  case  to  the  Commissioner,  the  taxpayer  should

58.
include the following information:

(a)

(b)

the basis upon which the opinion is formed that the actions of
the  Commissioner  and/or  the  DTA  state  result  or  will  result
for  that  taxpayer  in  taxation  not  in  accordance  with  the
relevant DTA;

full  details  of  the  relevant  transactions  and  the  parties  to  the
transactions  as  well  as  the  actions  relied  upon;  including  the
identification  of  the  DTA  state  involved,  how  the  actions
affect  the  tax  liability  of  the  taxpayer  and  the  associated
foreign  enterprise  where  relevant,  and  particulars  of  the
taxation that does not accord with the relevant DTA; and

(c)

how the taxpayer would like the problem resolved, including
provisions of the domestic tax law and the DTA applicable to
the resolution of the case.

19

Where  a  non-resident  taxpayer  presents  a  case  to  the  competent
59.
authority  of  its  resident  DTA  state  in  anticipation  of  the  Hong  Kong  SAR
providing  relief  from  double taxation, a copy of the case presented should be
provided  at  the  same  time  to  the  Commissioner.  The  provision  of  a  copy  at
this time may:

(a)

(b)

assist  in  the  resolution  of  the  case  in  the  quickest  possible
time  by  enabling
to  undertake  a
preliminary review of the case;

the  Commissioner

ensure that the Commissioner and the competent authority of
the  other  DTA  state  are  satisfied  that  the  case  has  been
presented within the time limits specified in the relevant DTA;
and

(c)

ensure that the requirements for presentation of a case to the
competent authority have been satisfied.

60.
The Mutual Agreement Procedure Article in the DTAs of the Hong
Kong  SAR  permits  a  taxpayer  to  present  a  case  to  the  relevant  competent
authority  within  three  years  from  the  first  notification  to  the  taxpayer  of  the
actions giving rise to taxation not in accordance with the DTA.

61.
For  the  purpose  of  applying  this  time  limit,  the  first  notification  of
actions  giving  rise  to  taxation  not  in  accordance  with  the  DTA  is  usually  the
relevant notice of assessment or loss computation issued by the Commissioner
or  the  equivalent  notification  from  a  DTA  state.    This  view  accords  with
paragraph 21 of the Commentary on the Mutual Agreement Procedure Article
of  the  OECD  Model,  which  considers  that  the  first  notification  should  be
interpreted in the way most favourable to the taxpayer.

62.
The  competent  authority  on  being  presented  with  a  case  by  a
taxpayer, must consider whether the case is justified (e.g. whether the taxpayer
has reasonable grounds upon which to seek competent authority consideration).
The action complained of must be directed specifically at the taxpayer.

20

The  Commissioner  could  be  expected  to  consider  a  case  as  being
63.
justified where the taxpayer has received notification in writing (e.g. a position
paper  or  a  notice  of  assessment  or  equivalent  notice)  from  either  the
Commissioner or the tax administration of a DTA state of a proposed transfer
pricing or profit reallocation adjustment. This notification would need to reflect
that  an  examination  or  audit  of  the  taxpayer’s  affairs  was  significantly
advanced in this regard (i.e. not just a mere possibility), and include details of
adjustments, the amount involved and the basis of calculation.

Actions  that  the  Commissioner  is  unlikely  to  consider  sufficient  to

64.
justify a case include:

(a)

the mere existence of an audit or an examination of the affairs
of the taxpayer or associated non-resident enterprise; or

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

requests  from  the  Commissioner  or  a  DTA  state  for  an
exchange of information about the dealings between the Hong
Kong enterprise and an associated non-resident enterprise; or

discussions  between  the  taxpayer  and  a  DTA  state  about  the
amount  and  source  of  profits  considered  attributable  to  the
permanent  establishment  under  the  Business  Profits  Article;
or

discussions between an associated non-resident enterprise and
a  DTA  state  concerning  non-arm’s  length  dealings  between
the taxpayer and the associated non-resident enterprise; or

an interpretation of the tax laws by the Commissioner or of a
DTA  state  ruling  or  of  policy  of  a  general  nature  that  the
taxpayer believes could be applied to it and, if so, may result
in taxation not in accordance with the DTA.

The issues raised by a ruling or policy of a DTA state will usually be
65.
of  general  application  and  will  not  be  related  to  any  particular  taxpayer.    A
taxpayer should not base on any such ruling or policy to initiate the procedure.
However,  such  ruling  or  policy  may  be  useful  to  resolving  any  difficulties  or
doubts  about  the  interpretation  or  application  of  the  DTA  with  the  other

21

competent authority under the appropriate provision of the Mutual Agreement
Procedure  Article.  Therefore  taxpayers  may  bring  to  the  attention  of  the
Commissioner such ruling or policy.

Stage 2 - Joint resolution

66.
The second stage commences with the competent authority that has
been  presented  with  the  case  approaching  the  other  competent  authority.
Paragraph 37 of the Commentary on Article 25 of the OECD Model recognises
that this stage imposes on the competent authorities a duty to negotiate and to
use their best endeavours to resolve a case.

67.
Where the primary transfer pricing or profit reallocation adjustment
is made by a DTA state, it can be expected that the Commissioner will seek to
resolve the case by reaching a mutual understanding as to:

(a)

the principles embodied in the DTA;

(b)

the facts of the particular case; and

(c)

how those principles should be applied to the facts of the case
in a way which does not result in unrelieved double taxation.

68.
Where  the  primary  adjustment  is  made  by  the  Commissioner,  the
Commissioner  will  demonstrate  to  the  other  competent  authority  that  the
transfer  pricing  or  profit  reallocation  adjustment  by  the  Commissioner  is  in
accordance  with  the  DTA  and  therefore,  it  is  appropriate  that  relief  from  any
resultant double tax should be provided by the other DTA state.

Year of adjustment

69.
Where the Commissioner provides relief from double taxation, it will,
as a matter of practice, adjust the tax payable for the year of assessment whose
basis period corresponds to the period for which the profits have been adjusted
or reallocated by the other DTA state.

22

Example 10

A  DTA  state  made  an  adjustment  to  increase  the  profits  of  the
associated  enterprise  resident  there  in  relation  to  a  particular
non-arm’s  length  transaction  with  the  Hong  Kong  enterprise  that
took  place  in  April  2005,  which  fell  within  its  accounting  period
ended 31 March 2006.

Appropriate  relief  will  be  provided  for  the  Hong  Kong  enterprise
against profits tax payable for the year of assessment 2005/06.

Example 11

A  DTA  state  increased  the  profits  of  the  associated  enterprise
resident  there  by  way  of  a  primary  adjustment  relating  to
transactions  with  the  Hong  Kong  enterprise  during  the  year  ended
31 December 2005.

Relief  will  be  provided  for  the  Hong  Kong  enterprise  against  tax
payable for the year of assessment 2005/06 if the basis period for the
Hong Kong enterprise was the year ended 31 December 2005.

Where either of the residents is, or both are, in a tax loss position in
70.
the year to which the primary adjustment relates, a correlative adjustment may
be  made  to  the  profits/income  tax  payable  in  a  subsequent  year.    The
Commissioner’s practice in relation to the year for which relief is provided will
depend  on  the  facts  of  each  case,  as  well  as  the  nature  and  timing  of  the
relevant adjustments.

71.
Where a DTA state provides relief from double taxation in response
to  a  primary  adjustment  made  by  the  Commissioner,  the  method  of  the
adjustment and the year to which it relates are matters to be determined by the
tax administration of that DTA state.

23

Competent authority communications

Communications  between  the  competent  authorities  will  usually  be
72.
through an exchange of position papers.    Information provided by the resident
taxpayer will be taken into account in the preparation of the Hong Kong SAR’s
position papers.

73.
Where  a  case  involves  significant  issues  upon  which  agreement
cannot  be  reached  through  the  exchange  of  position  papers,  the  competent
authorities may meet for negotiations.  The taxpayer does not have a right to
be  present  at  such  negotiations.  However,  where  both  competent  authorities
agree, the taxpayer may personally present its case to the competent authorities
jointly.  Where  the  competent  authority  of  a  DTA  state  does  not  agree  to  a
joint  presentation,  the  taxpayer  will  nevertheless  be  given  an  opportunity  to
present its case to the Commissioner.

The  Commissioner  will  endeavour  to  ensure  that  communications
74.
are undertaken on a timely basis to facilitate resolution of cases as quickly as
possible.
Taxpayers  will  be  kept  informed  of  the  progress  by  the
Commissioner.

Exchanges  of

75.
information  between  competent  authorities  are
undertaken under the Exchange of Information Article of the relevant DTA and
will be subject to the secrecy provisions of that Article.

Time for resolution of cases

Specific  provisions  in  a  DTA  dealing  with  time  limits  for
76.
implementation of competent authority agreement under the Mutual Agreement
Procedure  Article  take  precedence  over  the  normal  domestic  law  time  limits
that  would  otherwise  apply  to  the  provision  of  relief  from  double  taxation.
The DTAs of the Hong Kong SAR invariably include a provision in the Mutual
Agreement Procedure Article which states that any agreement reached shall be
implemented  notwithstanding  any  time  limits  in  the  domestic  laws  of  the
contracting  parties.  This  means  that  the  taxpayer  can  rest  assured  that,  by
presenting  a  case  to  the  competent  authority  under  the  Mutual  Agreement
Procedure  Article,  the  mere  expiration  of  domestic  time  limits  does  not
preclude the granting of relief.

24

Interaction between mutual agreement procedure and objection rights  under
the IRO

The Mutual Agreement Procedure Article in the DTAs of the Hong
77.
Kong  SAR  provides  taxpayers  with  an  avenue  for  review  in  addition  to  the
rights:

(a)

to  object  to  an  assessment  or  a  reassessment  under  section
64(1) of the IRO; and

(b)

to dispute the amount of a tax credit under section 50(9) of the
IRO.

78.
The Commissioner will consider concurrently a case presented to her
under the Mutual Agreement Procedure Article and an objection lodged by the
taxpayer under the provisions of the IRO.

79.
Competent  authority  consideration  will  cease  under  a  Mutual
Agreement  Procedure  Article  where  a  decision  to  wholly  allow  an  objection
has been made, since there will no longer be taxation that is not in accordance
with the DTA.

Where competent authority agreement is reached

An appropriate solution arrived at by both competent authorities may

80.
result in the Commissioner either:

(a)

restoring  the  taxpayer’s  original  tax  position  by  withdrawing
the primary adjustment; or

(b)

reducing  the  primary  adjustment  with  the  agreement  of  the
taxpayer.

Where the primary adjustment is reduced with the agreement of the
81.
taxpayer,  the  terms  of  the  agreement  will  be  recorded  in  writing  and  the
necessary adjustments will be made in accordance with section 64(3) if a valid
objection has been lodged in the first instance.    Where the Commissioner fails

25

to  agree  with  the  taxpayer  as  to  the  amount  of  the  primary  adjustment,  the
Commissioner will make a determination under section 64(4).

82.
Where  an  assessment  or  additional  assessment  challenged  by  the
taxpayer  involves  a  number  of  issues  (e.g.  a  transfer  pricing  adjustment  in
relation to an interest free loan and a profit reallocation adjustment between the
head office and its foreign branch), a settlement agreement entered into by the
taxpayer  with  the  Commissioner  may  be  limited  to  those  issues  resolved
mutually by the competent authorities. This means that the taxpayer may still
proceed  with  domestic  objection  and  appeal  rights  in  relation  to  the  issues
unresolved through the Mutual Agreement Procedure.

Where taxpayer does not agree with competent authority agreement

Where  competent  authorities  have  reached  agreement  but  the
83.
taxpayer does not agree with the implementation of the agreement, the taxpayer
can continue to seek relief using its domestic objection and appeal rights, if still
applicable.  The competent authorities generally will not communicate further
on the matter.

Where competent authority agreement has not been reached

Where  competent  authorities  have  not  agreed  on  an  appropriate
84.
solution  to  the  case  by  the  time  the  Commissioner  determines  an  objection
under  section  64(4),  the  taxpayer  has  a  right  to  appeal  to  Board  of  Review
under  section  66  if  dissatisfied  with  the  determination.    The  continuation  or
otherwise  of  endeavours  by  the  competent  authorities  under  the  Mutual
Agreement  Procedure  Article  during  the  objection  and  appeal  stages  will  be
considered on a case by case basis.

Taxpayers  should  take  into  account  the  possibility  that  endeavours
85.
by  the  competent  authorities  may  cease  at  the  objection  and  appeal  stages.
Sufficient  time  must  be  made  available  to  the  competent  authorities  to  reach
agreement to resolve the case, otherwise a taxpayer may have to rely only on
the  applicable  domestic  objection  and  appeal  rights  (or  any  rights  available
under the laws of the other DTA state).

26

The Commissioner would take action to give effect to a decision of
86.
the  Board  of  Review  or  an  order  of  the  courts  which  is  either  wholly  or
partially in the taxpayer’s favour.  Once a decision of the Board of Review or
an  order  of  the  courts  has  been  made,  the  Commissioner  will  abide  by  that
decision  or  order.  The  subsequent  endeavours  of  the  Commissioner  as  the
competent  authority  under  a  DTA  will  be  limited  to  demonstrating  to  the
competent  authority  of  the  other  DTA  state  that  the  transfer  pricing  or  profit
reallocation adjustment by the Commissioner is in accordance with the DTA in
terms of principle and amount, and that relief should be provided by that DTA
state.

Interaction  between  mutual  agreement  procedure  and  review  rights  in  the
other DTA state

The  Mutual  Agreement  Procedure  Article  provides  a  process  to
87.
resolve  problems  in  addition  to  any  objection,  review  and  appeal  rights  that
may be available to a resident taxpayer or its non-resident associated enterprise
under the respective laws of both DTA states.

The successful exercise of objection, review and appeal rights in the
88.
other DTA state may give rise to the result that there is no longer any taxation
which  is  contrary  to  the  DTA.  Under  these  circumstances,  it  would  be
inappropriate for the taxpayer to obtain any correlative relief in the Hong Kong
SAR.

Depending upon the circumstances of each case, the provision of any

89.
correlative adjustment by the Commissioner will be conditional upon either:

(a)

(b)

the  resident
taxpayer  and  any  non-resident  associated
enterprise  having  exhausted  or  rescinded  objection,  review
and appeal rights in the other DTA state; or

the  resident  taxpayer  in  a  transfer  pricing  adjustment  case
agreeing to advise the Commissioner should objection, review
and appeal rights be exercised by the non-resident associated
enterprise in the other DTA state; or

27

(c)

the resident taxpayer in a profit reallocation case agreeing to
advise the Commissioner should objection, review and appeal
rights be exercised in the other DTA state.

90.
In relation to the situations outlined under (b) or (c) in paragraph 89
above,  the  issue  of  any  revised  assessment  or  the  provision  of  a  credit  for
foreign taxes paid will be deferred until such time as the objection, review and
appeal rights in the other DTA state have lapsed or are subsequently rescinded
or exhausted.

Payment of tax during mutual agreement procedure

91.
In respect of a case which has been presented to the Commissioner, a
taxpayer may apply to hold over under section 71 the profits tax payable if a
valid objection under section 64 has been lodged.  Each request to hold over
the payment of tax under objection will be decided on its merits in accordance
with Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 6.
