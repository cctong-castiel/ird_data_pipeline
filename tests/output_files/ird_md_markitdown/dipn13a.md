INTRODUCTION

Interest  expense,  insofar  as  it  is  incurred  in  the  production  of  the
chargeable profits of a person, is deductible from the assessable profits of the
person.    With  the  gradual  removal  of  interest  tax  in  the  1980’s  and  the
limitation  in  taxing  offshore  interest  income  earned  by  a  person  carrying  on
business  in  Hong  Kong,  the  taxation  scheme  on  interest  receipts  and  interest
payments  have  become  asymmetrical,  in  that  interest  income  is  not  taxable
while  interest  expenses  are  tax  deductible.    Recognising  the  risk  of  revenue
loss that might be caused by tax avoidance schemes that would take advantage
of  the  lack  of  symmetry   in  tax  treatment  on  interest,  specific  rules  were
introduced in 1984 and 1986 to restrict the deduction of interest under certain
revamped
circumstances.
substantially  by  the  recent  amendments  introduced  by  the  Inland  Revenue
(Amendment) Ordinance 2004 (the 2004 Amendment Ordinance), with a view
to bolstering up the interest deduction rules.    This Interpretation and Practice
Note  sets  out  the  Department’s  views  and  practices  on  the  interest  deduction
scheme  that  applies  before  and  after  the  commencement  of  the  2004
Amendment  Ordinance,  which  came  into  operation  on  25  June  2004.    [The

INTEREST DEDUCTION SCHEME
BEFORE  THE  COMMENCEMENT  OF  THE  2004  AMENDMENT
ORDINANCE

Following the abolition of interest tax, anti-avoidance measures were
2.
enacted in relation to interest deductions under profits tax to protect the profits
tax  yield.    In  addition  to  the  interest  being  incurred  in  the  production  of
chargeable  profits,  specific  conditions  must  also  be  satisfied  before  interest
expenses could be allowed as deductions in computing assessable profits.    In
practice, these measures required all claims for deductions in respect of interest
payable on moneys borrowed for the purpose of producing assessable profits to
be  supported  by   sufficient  details  and/or  documentary  evidence  to  satisfy  at
least one of the six prescribed conditions in section 16(2)(a) to (f).    [Sections
of  the  Main  Ordinance  referred  to  in  paragraphs  2  –  9  are  those  provisions

that  were  in  force  before  the  commencement  of  the  2004  Amendment
Ordinance.]

Conditions for  Deduction

Conditions (a) and (b) were largely  self-explanatory  and referred to
3.
borrower  taxpayers  who  were  financial  institutions  or  public  utilities.    All
borrowings  by   a  financial  institution  satisfied  condition  (a),  while  any
borrowings by  public utilities at a rate of interest not exceeding a specified rate
satisfied condition (b).

Condition  (c)  applied  to  borrowings  from  persons  other  than
4.
financial  institutions  or  overseas  financial  institutions.     It  would  be  satisfied
by  the  borrower  establishing  that  any  interest  payable  on  the  loan  was
chargeable to profits tax under the Inland Revenue Ordinance (IRO).    Where
the money  borrowed had been made available to the borrower in Hong Kong, it
would generally  be clear that any interest paid on the loan would be chargeable
to profits tax in the hands of the lender who was carrying on a trade or business
in  Hong  Kong,  as  the  interest  income  was  sourced  in  Hong  Kong.     In  such
cases, to demonstrate that condition (c) was satisfied, it would be sufficient to
disclose  the  identity   of  the  lender,  the  place  of  his  business,  and   the  place
where  the   money   borrowed  was  made  available  to  the  borrower,  so  as  to
establish  that  the  interest  paid  was  chargeable  to  profits  tax.    On  the  other
hand,  where  the  loan  was  made  available  to  the  borrower  outside  of  Hong
Kong  as  an  offshore  loan,  there  would  be  a  prima  facie  presumption  that  any
interest  payable  was  not  chargeable  to  profits  tax  (for  being  incurred  outside
Hong Kong)) and that condition (c) was not satisfied.    This presumption could,
of course, be rebutted  by  the borrower demonstrating that notwithstanding the
loan being offshore, the lender nevertheless carried on business in  Hong Kong
and was chargeable to  profits tax on the interest received.

Condition  (d)  referred

5.
to  moneys   borrowed  from  financial
institutions  or  overseas  financial  institutions.    Its  practical  application  was
best  explained  by   distinguishing  such  borrowings  into  those  that  satisfied  the
condition and those that did not.    A loan from a financial institution (whether
local or overseas) would satisfy condition (d) if –

2

y  The loan was not secured or guaranteed by any  deposit made

with that or another financial institution; or

y  The  loan  was  secured  or  guaranteed  against  a  deposit  with

that or another financial institution, by –

−

the borrower or on his behalf, or,

− 	 a person who was closely  associated with the  borrower (an

associate as defined in section 16(3)),

and the interest received on the deposit was subject to profits tax.

Where a loan from a financial institution was secured or guaranteed against a
deposit with that or another financial institution and the interest received on the
deposit  was  not  chargeable  to  tax  in  Hong  Kong,  condition  (d)  would  not  be
satisfied.

The following examples illustrate the above situations –

Example 1

Mr  A  carried  on  business  as  a  plastics  manufacturer.    In  order  to
obtain  additional  working  capital,  he  borrowed  from  a  local  bank.
This borrowing was secured by a mortgage over the factory premises
owned by Mr A.

Because the loan was not secured by a deposit, the borrowing clearly
satisfied condition (d).

Example 2

Mr B carried on an export/import business in Hong Kong.    In order
to obtain additional working capital, he borrowed from a local bank.
The  borrowing  was  secured  by  a  fixed  deposit  with  that  same  bank
registered in the name of Mr B’s wife, who carried on no business in
Hong Kong.

3

The  interest  received  by  Mrs  B  was  not  chargeable  to  tax  in  Hong
Kong and as the relationship between Mr and Mrs B (as husband and
wife) was one within the class of “associates” prescribed  in section
16(3), the borrowing by Mr B did not satisfy condition (d).

Example 3

C  Limited  carried  on  business  in  Hong  Kong  as  an  electronics
manufacturer.  For the purpose of acquiring new factory premises,
C Limited borrowed from a local bank.  This borrowing was partly
secured by a fixed deposit with the same bank registered in the name
of  D  Limited,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  C  Limited.    D  Ltd
carried on business in Hong Kong.

Although the borrowing was secured against a deposit owned by an
“associated  corporation”,  condition  (d)  was  satisfied  because  the
interest on the deposit was chargeable to profits tax in the hands of D
Limited.

Example 4

E Limited carried on business in Hong Kong as consultants.  Mr E,
who was the major shareholder and managing director of E Limited,
received  dividends  and  a  salary  from  the  company.
  For  the
purposes of expanding its business, E Limited borrowed from a local
bank.  This borrowing was secured by a fixed deposit in the name of
Mr E with a Cayman Islands financial institution.

Being  both  a  shareholder  and  a  director  of  E  Limited,  Mr  E  was
related to E Limited as an associate within the terms of section 16(3).
As Hong Kong tax was not chargeable on interest received by Mr E
from  the  Cayman  Islands  deposit,  the  borrowing  by  E  Limited  did
not satisfy condition (d).

In  practice,  the   most  appropriate  way   of  establishing  that  condition
6.
(d)  was  satisfied  was  for  the  taxpayer  to  submit  a  statement  with  his  return
setting out details of both the borrowing and the security or guarantee provided
for  the  loan.     Where  the  security   or  guarantee  took  the  form  of  a  deposit

4

owned  by  a  person  other  than  the  borrower,  the  relationship  between  that
person and the borrower and whether that person carried on a business in Hong
Kong  should  be  clearly  explained.    Further,  if  the  borrowing  was  from  a
financial  institution  which  did  not  carry  on  business  in  Hong  Kong,  then
sufficient  details  of  that  institution  should  be  provided  so  as  to  enable  the
Commissioner  to  determine  whether  it  was  an  overseas  financial  institution
which could be recognized for the purposes of section 16(2), (3) and (4).  To
qualify as an  overseas  financial institution, the institution in question must be
adequately supervised by a supervisory authority.

7.

Condition (e) would be satisfied by the borrower establishing that –

y  the  money   had  been  borrowed  wholly  and  exclusively   to
finance capital expenditure on machinery  and plant, or for the
purchase  of  trading  stock,  for  the  purpose  of  producing
chargeable profits; and

y  the  lender  was  not  an  associate  of  the  borrower  in  terms  of

section 16(3).

Finally,   condition  (f)  related  to  corporate  borrowings  by   way   of
8.
debentures or other “marketable instruments”.     As regards the interest payable
on  debentures,  the  condition  would  be  satisfied  where  such  debentures  were
listed  on  a  stock  exchange  in  Hong  Kong  or  any   other  stock  exchange
recognized  by  the  Commissioner.     Insofar  as  “marketable  instruments”  were
concerned, the condition would be satisfied if the instruments were issued-

y  bona  fide  and  in  the  course  of  carrying  on  business  and  was
marketable in Hong Kong or any  other major financial centre
approved by  the Commissioner; or

y  pursuant  to  the  authorisation  of  the  Securities  and  Futures
Commission  under  section  105  of  the  Securities  and  Futures
Ordinance  [under  section  4(2)(g)  of  the  Protection  of
Investors Ordinance before 1 April 2003.].

9.
Condition (f) would also be satisfied where the borrowing was from
an  associated  corporation  and  the  moneys  borrowed  in  the  hands  of  the
associated  corporation  arose  entirely  from  the  proceeds  of  an  issue  of
debentures or marketable instruments as described above.    As for borrowings

5

from associated corporations, the deduction for interest paid by the borrowing
corporation  was  restricted  to  the  amount  of  interest  paid  by   the   associated
corporation to the holders of its debentures or instruments.

INTEREST DEDUCTION SCHEME
AFTER  THE  COMMENCEMENT  OF  THE  2004  AMENDMENT
ORDINANCE

The  2004  Amendment  Ordinance  has

introduced  substantial
10.
amendments  to  the  interest  deduction  scheme.     The  conditions  for  interest
deduction under section 16(2)(a) to (f) as regards the types of loans remain, in
broad  terms,  the  same  as  before.    However,  the  condition  under  section
16(2)(d)  on  the  loan   not  being  secured  or   guaranteed  by  a  deposit  that  can
generate tax free interest has been removed to a new provision [section 16(2A)]
which  has  a  broader   application.     New  provisions  have  also  been  added  to
restrict  the  deduction  of  interest  despite  the  satisfaction  of  the  respective
conditions  under  section  16(2).    The  new  scheme  of  interest  deduction  after
the 2004 Amendment Ordinance is discussed below.

Conditions for  Deduction

Conditions  (a)  and  (b)  –  borrowings  by  financial  institutions  and  public
utilities

No  amendment  has  been  made  to  these  two  conditions.    All
11.
borrowings by a financial institution and any  borrowings by public utilities at a
rate of interest not exceeding a specified rate will continue to satisfy conditions
(a) and (b) respectively.

Condition (c) – borrowings from persons other than financial institution

  The
12.
The  main  part  of  this  subsection  remains  unchanged.
comments  in  paragraph  4  above  continue  to  apply.    In  addition,  interest
deduction  on  a  loan  satisfying  this  condition  is  also  subject  to  the  new
restrictions under section 16(2A) and (2B).

6

Condition  (d)  –  borrowings  from  financial  institutions  or  overseas
financial institutions

This  condition  will  be  satisfied  if  the  loan  is  borrowed  from  a
13.
financial institution or an overseas financial institution.     The requirement that
the loan is not being secured by  a deposit of the borrower or his associate that
ndition, but a similar test
can generate tax free interest is removed from this co
is  added  as  a  criterion  for  restricting  interest  deduction  under  section  16(2A).
On  top  of  that,  deduction  of  interest  payable  on  this  type  of  loan  is  further
subject to the new restrictions under section (2B).

Condition (e) – borrowings for specified purposes

As  before,  this  condition  will  be  satisfied  by   the  borrower

14.
establishing that –

y  the  money  has  been  borrowed  whol

vely  to
finance capital expenditure on machinery  and plant, or for the
purchase  of  trading  stock,  for  the  purpose  of  producing
chargeable profits; and

ly   and  exclusi

y  the  lender  is  not  an  associate  of  the  borrower  in  terms  of

section 16(3).

Deduction of interest under this type of loan is subject to the new restrictions
under section 16(2A) and (2B).

Condition (f) – interest on debentures and debt instruments

This condition continues to relate to corporate borrowings by  way  of
15.
debentures or other marketable debt instruments.    For the interest payable on
debentures, the condition will be satisfied where such debentures are listed on a
stock exchange in Hong Kong or any  other stock exchange recognized by the
Commissioner.       Insofar as debt instruments are concerned, the condition will
be satisfied if the instruments are issued -

(A)  	 bona  fide  and  in  the   course  of  carrying  on  business  and  is
marketed  in  Hong  Kong  or  any  other  major  financial  centre
recognized by  the Commissioner; or

7

(B)

pursuant  to  any  agreement  or  arrangements,  where  the  issue
of an advertisement, invitation or  document  in respect of the
agreement or arrangements to the public has been authorized
by   the Securities and  Futures  Commission under section 105
of the Securities and Futures Ordinance.

Marketed

The  two  conditions   relating  to  the  interest  deduction  on  debt
16.
instruments  resemble  closely   the  corresponding  provisions  that  prevailed
immediately   before  the  2004  Amendment  Ordinance.  The  only   major
difference is that debt instruments (other than those issued under an  agreement
or  arrangement  with  the  approval  of  the  Securities  and  Futures  Commission)
that qualify for interest deduction have to be actually  marketed in Hong Kong
or  in  a  major  financial  centre  recognized  by   the  Commissioner.     This  means
that  to  satisfy  the  condition,  not  only  should  the  instrument  be  marketable,
there  should  also  be   some  actual  marketing  activities  conducted  when,  or
shortly after, the instrument is issued.

Whether  an  instrument  has  been   marketed  is  a  matter  of  fact  to  be
17.
determined by reference to the common market practices.    The followings are
some of the conditions the existence of which may indicate that the instrument
has been marketed –

(i)

(ii)

road-shows or meetings with potential investors are conducted
before the issue of the instrument;.

research  reports  on  the  issuer  are  published  by   major  market
participants;

(iii)

the instrument is rated by reputable credit rating agencies, e.g.
Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s, Fitch IBCA, etc.;

(iv)

the  instrument  is  cleared  through  one  of  the  recognized
clearing systems, e.g. the CMU (Central Moneymarkets Unit)
the  Hong  Kong  Monetary  Authority,  Euroclear,
of
Clearstream,  etc.;

(v)

the  description  of  the  instrument  is  displayed  on   major
information  networks,  e.g.  Reuters,
real-time  financial
Bloomberg, Telerate, etc.;

8

(vi) 	 one or more market participants agree to quote bid prices on

the instrument under normal market conditions;

(vii) 	 evidence that shows the existence of trading of the instrument
in  the  secondary  markets,  e.g.  transaction  records  in  the
clearing systems.

Issue of debentures or instruments through associated corporation

18.
As before, condition (f) will also be satisfied where the borrowing is
from  an  associated  corporation  and  the  moneys  borrowed  in  the  hands  of  the
associated  corporation  arose  entirely  from  the  proceeds  of  an  issue  of
debentures  or  instruments  as  described  above.    As  for  borrowings  from
associated  corporations,  the  deduction  of  interest  paid  by  the  borrowing
corporation  is  restricted  to  the  amount  of  interest  paid  by  the  associated
corporation to the holders of its debentures or instruments.

Deduction  of  interest  under  this  condition  is  subject  to  the  new

19.
restriction under section 16(2C).

Limitation of Deduction of Interest

The  2004  Amendment  Ordinance  lays  down  restrictions  on  interest
20.
deduction  under  certain  circumstances.
  Deduction  of  interest  on  loans
borrowed from non-financial institutions (condition (c) loans), borrowed from
financial  institutions  (condition  (d)  loans)  or  borrowed  for  specified  purposes
(condition  (e)  loans)  will  all  be  subject  to  two  additional  tests  under  section
16(2A) and (2B) –

Section 16(2A)

(i)

the  loan  is  not  secured  by  a  deposit  or  loan  made  by  the
borrower or a person associated with the borrower with or to
the  lender,  a  financial  institution,  an  overseas  financial
institution  or  an  associate  of  any  of  these  parties,  where  the
interest generated by such deposit or  loan  is  not  taxable  (i.e.
the secured-loan test); and

9

Section 16(2B)

(ii)

there is no arrangement in place such that the interest payment
is  ultimately  paid  back  to  the  borrower  or  to  a  person
connected with the borrower (i.e. the interest flow-back test).

21.
As  regards  the  deduction  of  interest  on  debentures  or  debt
instruments, it will be subject to the same interest flow-back test (section 16(2C)
as that  mentioned in paragraph 20(ii) above).     Nevertheless, failure to comply
with  these  tests  does  not  necessarily   disqualify   the  interest  expense  in  its
entirety from a deduction claim.     In the case of a partial failure, the restriction
on interest deduction will only be confined to the portion of the interest relating
to the portion of loan,  debenture or debt instruments that failed the tests and the
time in which the failure persisted.

22.
Bankers may have the right to utilise balances in deposit accounts of
a customer to set off the outstanding loan and interest payable by that customer
in  the  case  of  default  in  repayment  of  the  loan.    Despite  such  right  of  the
bankers,  the  balances  in  deposit  accounts  of  a  customer  who  also  borrows
money  from  the  bank  would  not  be  taken  as  a  security  of  the  loan  if  the
customer’s right to withdraw the deposit is not restricted at any time before he
defaults  in  repayment  of  the  loan.    Such  deposit,  which  the  depositor  has
unrestricted right to operate before the bank exercises the right of set-off, does
not appear to be, by  nature, a security for the loan.

Restriction under section 16(2A) [The secured-loan test]

Restriction  of  deduction  under  section  16(2A)  applies  to  interest
23.
deduction claims on loans satisfying the conditions under section 16(2)(c), (d)
or  (e).    The  provision  is  triggered  when  the  following  situation  exists  at  any
time  during  the  basis  period  of  the  borrower  in  respect  of  which  interest
deduction is claimed –

(i)

the payment of any  interest or the repayment of any  principal
of the loan in  question is secured or  guaranteed by   a deposit
(or a loan);

(ii)

the  said  deposit  (or  loan)  is  made  by  the  borrower  or  an
associate of his with (or to) a specified person;

10

(iii)

the specified person is either –

a. 	 the lender or an associate of the lender;

b.  a  financial  institution	  or  an  associate  of  a  financial

institution; or

c.  	 an  overseas  financial  institution  or  an  associate  of  an

overseas financial institution; and

(iv)

the  deposit  or  loan  generates  interest  income  that  is  not
chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.

The  term  “associate”  has  the  same   meaning  before  and  after  the  2004
Amendment Ordinance, as defined in section 16(3).

This section, when  applicable, will reduce the interest deduction  by
24.
an  amount  calculated  on  a  basis  as  is  most  reasonable  and  appropriate  in  the
circumstances  of  the  case,  having  regard  to  the  amount  of  interest  income
arising  from  deposit  or  loan  in  question.    The  following  examples  illustrate
the Department’s practice.

Example 5

  borrowed  $1M  from  Bank  G  at  5%  interest  rate  p.a.
Taxpayer  F
The  loan  was  secured  by  a  fixed  deposit  of  $1M  earning  tax-free
interest  of  4%   p.a.     There  was  no  other  security.    In  the  year  of
assessment,  F  earned  interest  of  $40,000  from  the  deposit  and  paid
interest of $50,000 on the loan.

The  amount  of  interest  expenses  allowable  for  deduction  will  be
reduced  by  $40,000,  being  the  tax-free  interest  earned.    In  other
words, the allowable interest is $10,000.

Example 6

The  $1M  loan  in  Example  5  was  secured  by  a  deposit  of  $500,000
and  some  shares  which  were  also  worth  $500,000.    The  deposit
generated tax-free interest of $20,000.

11

The  amount  of  interest  expenses  allowable  for  deduction  will  be
reduced by  the amount of tax-free interest ($20,000) generated from
the deposit.     In other words, the allowable interest is $30,000.

Example 7

The  $1M  loan  in  Example  5  was  secured  by  a  deposit  of  $2M  that
generated tax-free interest of $80,000.    There was no other security.

The  amount  of  interest  expenses  allowable  for  deduction  will  be
reduced by  $40,000, which is calculated as follows –

$80,000 x

$1M (loan)
$2M (deposit)

  = $40,000

Example 8

The $1M loan in Example 5 was secured by a deposit of $1M (which
generated  tax-free  deposit  interest  of  $40,000)  and  some  shares
valued at $500,000.

The  amount  of  interest  expenses  allowable  for  deduction  will  be
reduced by  $26,667, which is calculated as follows -

$40,000 x

$1M (deposit)
$1.5M (deposit + shares)

=

$26,667

The  value  of  shares  used  as  security   may   vary  from  time  to  time.
For the purposes of this calculation, a reasonable basis of averaging,
such as by  reference to month end balances, will be accepted.

Example 9

A deposit of $2M (generating tax-free interest of $80,000) was used
to  secure   a  loan  of  $1M  used  for  financing  onshore  business
$1.5M  used  for  financing  offshore
activities  and  another  loan  of
businesses.    Interest  incurred  on  the  onshore  business  loan  was
$50,000 and that on the offshore business loan was $80,000.

12

In  this  example,  the  deposit  was  used  to  secure  two  loans.    The
amount of interest expenses allowable for deduction will be reduced
by  $32,000, which is calculated as follows -

$80,000 x

$1M (onshore loan)
$2.5M (onshore loan + offshore loan)

  = $32,000

Example 10

The two loans in Example 9 were secured by a deposit of $4M, which
generated  tax-free  interest  of  $160,000.    There  was  no  other
security.

In  this  example,  the  portion  of  deposit  that   was  used  to  secure  the
two  loans  is  $2.5M  /  $4M;  and  out  of  this  portion,  the  part
attributable to the onshore loan is $1M / $2.5M.

The  amount  of  interest  expenses  allowable  for  deduction  will  be
reduced by  $40,000, which is calculated as follows –

$160,000 x

$2.5M
$4M

x

$1M
$2.5M

= $40,000

In  considering  the  relation  between  the  borrower  and  the  holder  of
the deposit or loan used as security, if a deposit or loan is  made by  a trustee of a
trust or a corporation controlled by  such a trustee, the deposit or loan shall be
deemed  to  have  been   made  by   each  of  the  trustee,  the  corporation  and  the
beneficiary   under  the  trust  [section  16(2D)].    Section  16(3)   contains  a
definition of “beneficiary  under the trust”.

Restriction under section 16(2B) [The interest flow-back test]

Deduction  of  interest  on  loans  that  satisfy  the  conditions  under
26.
section  16(2)(c),  (d)  or  (e)  will  be  restricted  if  there  is  an  arrangement  under
which  the  interest  payable  will  be  paid,  directly   or  through  an  interposed
person, back to the borrower or to a person connected with the borrower who is
not  an  “excepted  person”  within  the  meaning  of  section  16(2E)(c).    The

13

provision applies where the said arrangement exists at any time during the basis
period of the borrower for the year of assessment in respect of which deduction
is claimed for the interest on the respective loan.    Any  payment of interest to a
trustee or a corporation controlled by the trustee is deemed to be a payment to
each of the trustee, the corporation and the beneficiary  under the trust [section
16(2E)(b)].

27.

The term “arrangement” is defined in section 2.    It includes –

(a)

	 any   agreement,  arrangement,  understanding,  promise  or
undertaking,  whether  expressed  or  implied,  and  whether  or
not  enforceable  or  intended  to  be  enforceable,  by  legal
proceedings; and

(b)

any   scheme,  plan,  proposal,  action  or  course  of  action  or
course of conduct.

The  provision  for  restricting  interest  deduction  will  be  invoked  whenever
arrangements  are  in  place,  irrespective  of  whether  the  passing  of  interest  has
actually occurred.

In this section, the reference to “any  sum payable by  way  of interest
28.
on the loan borrowed” is expanded by section 16(2E)(a) to cover the payment
of interest or principal in respect of any other loan, the repayment of which is
secured  by   the  payment  of  interest  or  repayment  of  principal  of  the  loan  in
question  (e.g.  the  second  loan  is  advanced  by   way  of  sub-participating  in  the
first loan borrowed by the borrower).

Example 11

Company  H  borrowed  a  loan  of  $100M  from  Bank  J.    Bank  J
entered into a loan sub-participation arrangement with Company K,
which  is  an  associated  company  of  Company  H.    Under  the
arrangement,  Company  K  advanced  a  loan  of  $100M  to  Bank  J  on
the condition that the repayment of principal and interest of this loan
by Bank J to Company K would only be made  on the condition of the
repayment of principal and interest of the bank loan by Company  H
to Bank J.    In practical terms, Bank J is risk free.

14

In this situation, the interest paid by  Bank J to Company  K is treated
as if it were the interest on the loan borrowed by Company  H from
Bank J when the restriction of section 16(2B) is considered.    As the
interest  was  paid  to  an  associated  company   of  the  borrower
(Company   H)  of  the  loan,  the  interest  deduction  claim  would  be
denied.

Interest Apportionment

Triggering  the  application  of  section  16(2B)  does  not  necessarily
29.
mean that the whole amount of interest incurred on a loan will be disqualified
for  deduction.    Indeed  the  section  allows  for  apportionment  of  interest
expenses in two ways –

y  The  provision  applies  to  arrangements  that  cover  interest
payable on a part of a loan, and this allows apportionment of
interest in the case where only part of the loan in question is
subject  to  an  arrangement  under  which  the  interest  payable
will be reverted back to the borrower or his connected person.

y  Where  the  arrangement  is  in  place  for  only   part  of  the  basis
period during which the loan interest is incurred, the interest
expenses  can  be  apportioned  on  a  time  basis.    This   means
that  only   the  portion  of  interest  attributable  to  the  period  of
time  during  which  the  arrangement  is  in  place  will  be
disallowed from deduction.

Example 12

Company  L   borrowed  a  loan  of  $10M  from   Bank  M  at  the  interest
  At  its  inception,  $7M  of  the  loan  was
rate  of  10%   p.a.
sub-participated by Company N, an associate company of Company
L.    The  repayment  by  Bank  M  to  Company  N  of  the  principal  and
interest of the $7M loan was made conditional to or secured by the
repayment  of  principal  and  interest  of  the  $10M  loan  made  by
Company  L  to  Bank  M.    In  a  year  of  assessment  Company  L  paid
interest  of  $1M  to  Bank  M,  and  correspondingly  Bank  M  paid
interest in the amount attributable to the $7M loan to Company N.

15

In this example only  $7M of the total loan was sub-participated by  a
person  connected  with  the  borrower  (Company   L).    Thus  only   the
interest attributable to the sub-participated portion, that is the amount
of $700,000 ($1M x 7/10), is subject to the adjustment under section
16(2B).    As  this  part  of  the  loan  was  participated  for  the  whole
period  during  which  interest  was  incurred,  the  full  amount  of  the
$700,000 interest would be disallowed by  section 16(2B).    However,
the  interest  on  the  remaining  part  of  loan  which  was  not
sub-participated  by   the  borrower  or  a  person  connected  to  him  (in
this case interest of $300,000) would be allowable for deduction.

Example 13

If  in  Example  12,  the  loan  of  $7M  (C)  was  sub-participated  by
Company  N  for  only   6  months  (A)  during  the  basis  period  of  the
year  of  assessment  (B)  concerned,  the  operation  of  section  16(2B)
will be as follows –

Interest payable on the portion of loan which was
sub-participated to Company N

Deduct: by  the amount (A/B x C)
(183days / 365 days x $0.7M)

Interest on sub-participated loan deductible

Add: Interest on the portion of the loan that is not

sub-participated ($3M/$10M x $1M)

Total interest deduction

($M)
0.7

0.35

0.35

0.3

0.65

Note  that  the  amount  of  interest  paid  on  the  sub-participated  loan
(the loan advanced by  Company  N to Bank M), even if of different
amount, is not relevant in the computation.

16

Restriction  under  section  16(2C)  [Interest  flow-back  test  on  debt
instruments]

Like  interest  on  ordinary  loans,  deduction  of  interest  on  debent

30.
ures
or  debt  instruments  that  satisfy  the  conditions  under  section  16(2)(f)  will  be
restricted  if  there  is  an  arrangement  under  which  the  interest  payable  will  be
paid, directly or through an interposed person, back to the borrower (the issuer)
or  to  a  person  connected  with  the  borrower  who  is  not  an  “excepted  person”
within the meaning of  section 16(2F)(c).    The provision applies when the said
arrangement exists at any  time  during the basis period of the borrower for the
year of assessment in respect of which deduction is claimed for the interest on
the  respective  loan.    Any  payment  of  interest  to  a  trustee  or  a  corporation
controlled by the trustee is deemed to be a payment to each of the trustee, the
corporation and the beneficiary under the trust [section 16(2F)(b)].

31.
Again,  the  term  “arrangement”  has  a  wide  coverage  as  defined  in
section  2  (see  paragraph  27  above).    The  provision  for  restricting  interest
deduction will be invoked whenever arrangements are in place, irrespective of
whether the passing of  interest has actually occurred.    Peculiar to the nature of
debentures and debt instruments, the term includes the holding of debentures or
debt  instruments  either  directly  or  beneficially   (i.e.  holding  any   interest  in
debentures or debt instruments).

32.
In this section, the reference to “any  sum payable by  way  of interest
on the debentures or instruments concerned” is expanded by  section 16(2F)(a)
to  cover  the  payment  of  interest  or  principal  in  respect  of  any  other  loan  the
repayment  of  which  is  secured  by  the  payment  of  interest  or  repayment  of
principal of the debentures or instruments concerned (see Example 11 above).

Interest Apportionment

Section  16(2C)  allows  for  apportionment  of  interest  expenses  in

33.
three ways  –

y  The  provision  applies  to  arrangements  in  relation  to  interest
expenses payable on any  debentures or instruments within an
issue.  This  allows  for  apportionment  of  interest  expenses
when  only  some   of  the  debentures  or  instruments  issued  are
held by the borrower or a connected person of the borrower.

17

y  The provision also applies to arrangements that cover interest
expenses  payable  in  the  interest  on  any   debentures  or
instrument concerned.    This allows apportionment of interest
expenses  in  the  case  where  the  beneficial  interest  in  a
debenture  or  an  instrument  is  shared  among  a  number  of
  connected  with
y  some  of  such  persons  are
persons,  and  onl
the issuer.

y  Where  the  arrangement  is  in  place  for  only   part  of  the  basis
period of the issuer during which the loan interest claimed for
deduction  was
interest  expenses  can  be
the
apportioned  on  a  time  basis.    This  means  that  only  the
portion of interest expenses attributable to the period of time
during which the arrangement was in place will be disallowed
from deduction.

incurred,

Example 14

Corporation  P  issued  debentures  in  amount  of  $100M  in   a
recognized  overseas  stock  market.     Out  of  the  issue,  an  associated
company  of  Corporation  P  subscribed  $80M  and  acquired  the
remaining  $20M  debentures  from  the  market  in  the  middle  of  the
year  of  assessment.  During  the  year  of  assessment  concerned  total
interest in the amount  of $10M was paid.    Corporation P adopts a
basis  period  that  corresponds  to  a  year  of  assessment  (i.e.  for  year
ended 31 March).

The interest deduction calculation will be as follows –

associated company

the associated company

Persons Connected with the Borrower  [Section 16(3B)]

This is a new concept  under the interest flow-back test.    A person is

34.
regarded as being connected with the borrower if the person is –

(a)

an associated corporation of the borrower; or

(b)

a person (other than a corporation) –

(i)

who controls the borrower;

(ii) 	 who is controlled by the borrower; or

(iii)  	 who  is  under  the  control  of  the  same  person  as  is  the

borrower.

The term “associated corporation” is defined in section 16(3).    This
35.
definition  has  not  been  changed  by  the  2004  Amendment  Ordinance.    The
meaning  of  the  term  “control”  [which  is  formerly   defined  in  section  16(3)]  is
now provided under section 16(3A).     So far as a corporation is concerned, the
meaning of control has not been changed by the 2004 Amendment Ordinance.
However,  it  has  been  expanded  to  cover  the  situation  of  controlling  a  person
who is not a corporation.

Excepted Persons

This  is  another  new  concept  under  the  interest  flow-back  test.
36.
Interest restriction under the test does not apply where under the arrangement

19

concerned,  the  interest  flows  to  a  connected  person  who  is  an  “excepted
person”.    The  definitions  of  excepted  person  under  sections  16(2E)(c)  and
16(2F)(c) are the same and cover the following categories –

y  a  person  who  is  charged  to  tax  in  respect  of  the  interest  in

question;

y  a person acting as a bare trustee;

y  a beneficiary of a unit trust to which section 26A(1A)(a)(i) or
(ii)  applies,  where  the  interest  payment  is  in  respect  of  a
specified investment scheme;

y  a  member  of  a  recognized  retirement  scheme,  or  a  similar
scheme  established  outside  Hong  Kong  accepted  by  the
Commissioner;

y  a  public  body  (which  is  defined  under  section  3  of  the
Interpretation  and  General  Clauses  Ordinance,  Cap  1,  as
including the Executive Council, the Legislative Council, and
District Council, any other urban, rural or  municipal council,
any  department of the Government, and any  undertaking by  or
of the Government);

y  a  body  corporate  of  which  the  Government  owns  more  than

half in nominal value of the issued share capital; or

y  a financial institution or an overseas financial institution.

Exemption for Market Makers of Debt Instruments

37.
Section  16(2G)  provides  for  an  exemption  from  the  interest
deduction  restriction  under  section  16(2C)  in  respect  of  debentures  or  debt
instruments.    The  restriction  does  not  apply   where  under  an  arrangement
interest  on  debentures  or  debt  instruments  is   payable  to  a  market  maker  who
holds such debentures  or instruments in the ordinary course of conduct of his
trade, profession or business in respect of  market making, notwithstanding that
the market maker is a person connected with the issuer.

20

The  purpose  of  holding  the  debentures  or  debt  instruments  must  be
38.
for  providing  liquidity  for  such  securities.    Under  normal  circumstances,
long-term  or  substantial  holdings  of  the  securities  will  not  be  considered  as
consistent with  market  making activities.    For this purpose, a holding of over
5% of an issue for a period of over 3 months will not be taken as a holding of
the  securities  in  the  ordinary  course  of  conduct  of  market  making  activities,
unless the Commissioner is satisfied that there are reasonable explanations for
doing so.

To  qualify  for  the  exemption,  the  market  maker  must  be  a  person

39.
who –

y  is  a  licensed  or  registered  dealer  of  securities  under  the
Securities  and  Futures  Ordinance  (Cap.  571),  or  in  a  major
financial  centre  outside  Hong  Kong  recognized  by  the
Commissioner;

y  in  the  ordinary  course  of  conduct  of  the   market  making
business,  holds  himself  out  as  being  willing  to  buy  and  sell
securities for his own account and on a regular basis; and

y  is actively involved in market making in securities issued by a

wide range of unrelated institutions.

APPLICATION  OF   THE  GENERAL  ANTI-AVOIDANCE  PROVISION
(SECTION 61A)

While the conditions and restrictions on interest expenses deduction
40.
ic  rules  governing  the  interest   deduction
under  section  16  lay  down  specif
scheme,  compliance  with  such  rules  and  conditions  does  not  preclude  the
application of the general anti-avoidance provision under section 61A in cases
that  satisfy  the  conditions  specified  in  section  61A.    Support  for  this
proposition  can  be  found  in  the  Privy  Council  decision  of   CIR  v.   Challenge
Corporation  Limited,  [1986]   STC  548,  and  the  Court  of  Appeal  decision  of
Yick Fung Estates Ltd. v. CIR, 5 HKTC 52.

21

GRANDFATHERING PROVISIONS

The application of the new interest deduction provisions of the 2004
41.
Amendment  Ordinance  is  set  out  in  section  16(5A).     As  a  general  rule,  the
new  scheme   will  apply  to
  interests  incurred  after  the  commencement  of  the
2004 Amendment Ordinance, that is, on or after 25 June 2004.

42.
Nevertheless,  interest  incurred  under  a  transaction  which  was  the
subject  of  an  advance  clearance,  or  under  an  arrangement  which  was  the
subject  of  an  advance  ruling  given  under  section  88A,  can  be  grandfathered
from  the  application  of  the  new  scheme.    To  qualify  for  grandfathering,  the
advance  clearance  or  the  advance  ruling  must  have  been  given  by  the
Commissioner,  before  25  June  2004,  on  the  issue  that  the  transaction  or  the
arrangement, as the case may be, would not fall within the terms of section 61A.
Deductions of interest expenses arising from these transactions or arrangements
(incurred after 25 June 2004) are governed by the provisions that were in force
before the amendments made by the 2004 Amendment Ordinance are effected
[see  paragraphs  2  –  9  above],  as  if  the  amendments  of  the  2004  Amendment
Ordinance to section 16 had not taken effect.

DUTY  OF  THE  TAXPAYER  TO  DISCLOSE  DETAILS  OF  INTEREST
DEDUCTION CLAIMS

It  is  the  duty  of  the  taxpayer  who  makes  a  claim  for  interest
43.
deduction  to  disclose  the  full  details  of  the  facts  that   may  af
fect  the
deductibility   of  the  interest  concerned.    It  is  therefore  necessary  for  him  to
ascertain and to disclose in the tax return whether there is any  arrangement in
place that may trigger the interest deduction restriction provisions under section
16(2A), (2B) or (2C).
