INTRODUCTION

The  Financial  Secretary  announced  in  his  1994-95  Budget  Speech
that  the  Administration  proposed  to  take  steps  to  deal  with  the  tax  avoidance
aspects  of  certain  “service  company  arrangements”.
types  of
arrangements were identified as causing particular concern.  The first (Type I
cases) amount to disguised employment arrangements where the remuneration
for services rendered by a person under employment-like conditions is paid not
as  salary  to  that  person,  but  as  a  consultancy  fee  to  a  service  company  he
controls.  The  second  (Type  II  cases)  typically  involve  deductions  being
claimed  by  an  unincorporated  business  for  payments,  often  described  as
management fees, which are made to a company or a trust (service company)
controlled by the proprietor or partners of the business.

Two

Following the announcement, consultations were held with a number
2.
of  practitioners  and  professional  groups  with  a  view  to  ascertaining  the  most
appropriate  way  to  address  the  areas  of  concern.  Having  considered  the
advice  received,  the  Administration  introduced  section  9A  to  the  Inland
Revenue  Ordinance  (“the  Ordinance”)
to  curb  Type  I  arrangements.
Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 25 discuss the application
of  the  relevant  provisions  which  were  introduced  following  the  enactment  of
the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 1995.

3.
With regard to Type II arrangements, it was decided that in the first
instance  legislation  would  not  be  required.  Rather,  the  Department  should
seek  to  discourage  abuse  by  both  explaining  in  a  Practice  Note  the
circumstances  under  which  service  company  claims  will  be  challenged  by
placing  greater  reliance  on  the  general  anti-avoidance  provisions  of  the
Ordinance.    Accordingly,  the  purpose  of  this  Practice  Note  is  to  set  out  the
Department’s position in relation to the application of the present terms of the
law to Type II arrangements.

TYPE II ARRANGEMENTS

4.
As  indicated  at  the  beginning  of  this  Practice  Note,  a  Type  II
arrangement  usually  involves  an  agreement  (service  company  agreement)
under which management fees are paid by a firm to a service company directly

or  indirectly  controlled  by  the  proprietor  or  partners  of  the  firm.    As
consideration for the fees paid, the agreement generally provides for the service
company to supply certain operating requirements to the firm.

It has become apparent to the Department that many arrangements of
5.

paid to the service company is allowed as a deduction and exceeds the cost that
would  have  been  incurred  if  it  had  directly  obtained  the  requirements  in
question,  the  assessable  profits  of  the  firm  will  be  reduced.    The  service
company in turn will normally seek to avoid or minimise exposure to tax on the
excess payment by claiming deductions for tax efficient remuneration provided
to connected parties (e.g. the proprietor or partners of the firm or their relatives)
as employees or directors of the service company.

LEGAL PRINCIPLES

6.
It  has  been  accepted  in  other  tax  jurisdictions  that  where  a
commercially realistic sum is paid under a service company arrangement for a
service essential to the conduct of a firm’s business, the presumption is raised
that the expenditure was for business purposes and is a genuine cost of earning
the firm’s income (i.e. incurred in the production of its profits).    However, it
has  also  been  recognised  that  the  converse  will  apply  if  the  expenditure  is
excessive, namely that the payment was not wholly for the services provided,
but for some other purpose.    This thinking is considered by the Department to
be  equally  applicable  to  management  fee  claims  under  the  Ordinance  and
accordingly it underlies the Department’s position in relation to such claims.

7.
It follows that it is recognised there may be valid commercial reasons
for the owners of an unincorporated business to make use of a service company
arrangement.  However, what has caused concern to the Department in recent
times has been the increase in the number of arrangements encountered where,
having regard to the services involved, the fees paid have been well in excess
of  commercially  realistic  amounts  and,  therefore,  by  implication,  are  not
incurred  wholly  in  the  production  of  chargeable  profits.    Equally  disturbing
have  been  the  cases  where  agreements  have  not  been  reduced  into  writing;
accounts have not been properly kept; or fees have been decided on an arbitrary
basis bearing little, if any, relationship to the cost of the services provided.

2

It is apparent that there is a lack of appreciation on the part of some
8.
practitioners and taxpayers of the options open to the Department to challenge
service  company  arrangements  where  they  fail  to  operate  on  a  proper
commercial  basis.    In  this  regard  it  should  be  noted  that  the  decisions  of  the
Board of Review in Case No. D19/99  14 IRBRD 209 and D153/01 17 IRBRD
189,  both  of  which  involved  inflated  management  fees,  provide  clear
illustrations  of  circumstances  under  which,  by  virtue  of  section  16(1)  of  the
Ordinance,  a  management  fee  can  be  dissected  and  that  part  which  is  not
attributable  to  the  production  of  chargeable  profits  disallowed.    Support  for
this view can be found in the observations of the Board in D19/99 -

At page 218

“a. Section 16

Section  16  ascertains  the  chargeable  profits  by  defining  which
outgoings and expenses are deductible from the chargeable profits of
a taxpayer.    Section 16(1) allows to ‘be deducted all outgoings and
expenses  to  the  extent  to  which  they  are  incurred  during  the  basis
period  ...  in  the  production  of  profits  in  respect  of  which  he  is
chargeable  to  tax  under  this  Part  for  any  period  including...’
Section 16(1) then sets out those expenses which are deductible.”

And at page 226

D61/91,  IRBRD,  vol  6,  457  and  D32/93,  IRBRD,  vol  8,
“20.
261  cited  by  the  Revenue  did  not  deal  with  section  61  and  the
question of artificial or fictitious transaction.    Nor did Case D32/94,
IRBRD,  vol  9,  97  in  which  the  taxpayer,  a  medical  practitioner,
admitted that section 61 applied to his case in order to avoid the dire
consequence of the board disallowing the management fee in total as
the  Board  was  of  the  view  that   on  the  evidence  of  that  case  the
management fee was indivisible.    Although the Board in D110/98,
IRBRD,  vol  13,  553  cited  to  us  mentioned  on  the  side  that  the
wording of section 61 does not allow the Revenue to disregard a part
of  a  transaction,  we  are  of  the  view  that  if  service  company
arrangement is to be disregarded in accordance with section 61, then
it  is  open  to  the  Revenue  to  assess  the  chargeable  profits  of  a

3

taxpayer  by  totally  ignoring  service  company  and  the  service  fees.
With service company and service company arrangement out of the
way (in other words, after lifting the corporate veil), it is open to the
Revenue to dissect the outgoing expenses of service company as if
such  outgoing  or  expenses  were  that  of  a  taxpayer  in  the  light  of
whether such outgoing or expenses were deductible to the extent to
which they are incurred in the production of a taxpayer’s chargeable
profits.”

9.
Taxpayers  should  also  be  mindful  of  the  view  expressed  by  the
Board of Review in Case No. D153/01 17 IRBRD 189 and D85/02 17 IRBRD
1017 to the effect that it may be appropriate to disallow entirely an excessive
management  fee  which  is  not  capable  of  being  split  into  its  component  parts.
In D153/01, at page 205, the Board said -

“53.
Whether  an  expense  is  an  allowable  expense  is  governed
by sections 16 and 17 of the IRO.  Section 16(1) permits deduction
of all outgoings and expenses which satisfy two criteria, namely (1)
they must be incurred in the production of assessable profits and (2)
they  must  be  incurred  during  the  basis  period  of  the  year  of
assessment  in  question.  Section  17  disallows  deduction  of  certain
types of outgoings and expenses.
If a taxpayer fails to prove that an
expense was incurred for the production of his assessable profits, the
whole of that expense will be disallowed.
In the present case, if the
Taxpayer is unable to prove that the management fees were incurred
in  the  production  of  his  assessable  profits,  the  whole  of  these
management  fees  would  be  disallowed.    But  if  an  expense  is
capable  of  analysis  and  subdivision  or  where  section  61  or  section
61A  applies  which  allows  dissection  of  the  expenses,  then  that
expense can be allowed ‘to the extent’ that it was incurred to produce
In  the
the  taxable  profits  and  the  balance  thereof  be  disallowed.
present  case,  since  the  management  fees  were  made  up  of  those
expenses as detailed in Company B’s profit and loss accounts plus a
mark-up  of  5%,  they  are  thus  capable  of  analysis  and  subdivision.
Accordingly, only those expenses which are proved to be incurred in
production  of  the  Taxpayer’s  assessable  profits  would  qualify  as
allowable deductions.”

4

And at page 206

“56.
We were asked by Counsel for the Taxpayer to decide on
the  question  of  whether  a  minute  examination  of  Company  B’s
expenses was permissible under the circumstances.    We decide that
we should allow an examination of Company B’s expenses in detail.
The amounts of management fees were calculated by reference to all
the expenses and outgoings incurred by Company B in providing the
requisite  services  plus  a  mark-up  of  5%.    Examination  of  those
expenses  and  outgoings  is  necessary  as  to  determine  whether  they
were incurred in production of the Taxpayer’s assessable profits.
In
so doing, we are not lifting the corporate veil nor are we saying that
the Taxpayer is not free to decide his own affairs but the question of
whether  an  expense  is  deductible  in  law  when  computing  the
chargeable  profits  must  be  answered  objectively.  We  must  look
into  the  purpose  of  the  payments  and  see  whether  the  expense  was
bona  fide  incurred  in  production  of  the  chargeable  profits.    The
onus is on the Taxpayer to show that each of those items of expenses
in Company B’s profits and loss accounts was bona fide incurred for
the  production  of  his  assessable  profits.  We  are  not  persuaded  by
Counsel  for  the  Taxpayer  that  since  Company  B’s  tax  position  was
not in dispute, the expenses in Company B’s accounts were the least
relevant.  Nor  do  we  accept  the  contention  that  once  the  Taxpayer
could  establish  that  the  management  fees  were  incurred  for  the
purpose  of  acquiring  professional  services  from  Company  B,  the
management  fees  should  be  allowed  in  full.  The  matter  does  not
stop there.  The Taxpayer is still required to prove that the expenses
were bona fide incurred for production of his assessable profits.”

10.
The view expressed by the Board on the above occasion may well be
regard as reflecting the principle stated in an earlier management fee case, “It is
for  the  Taxpayer  to  prove  that  the  money  had  been  used  in  the  production  of
the profits” [D96/89 6 IRBRD 372].

11.
The  relationship,  if  any,  of  the  management  fee  to  the  services
provided is also clearly an important consideration in relation to the question of
whether  there  is  a  commercial  rationale  for  a  service  company  arrangement.
In this regard, the Board observed in Case No. D110/98 13 IRBRD 553 at page
558 -

5

In  conclusion,  while  it  is  clear  that  some  of  the  expenses
“7.
of Company X did relate to the Taxpayer’s practice, the interposing
of  Company  X  was  in  reality  predominantly  designed  to  be  a  tax
vehicle whereby a lot of the Taxpayer’s personal expenses were to be
made  tax  deductible  and,  more  importantly,  to  enable  the  Taxpayer
It  was  hardly
to  reduce  his  tax  liability  to  minuscule  proportions.
necessary  nor  even  advantageous  for  the  Taxpayer  to  engage
Company  X  to  provide  services  to  his  practice  and  certainly  not  at
the management fee that company charged.  To put it another way,
if  Company  X  was  not  owned  by  the  Taxpayer  and  not  providing
him with the benefits it did (including loans on generous terms), we
would not have thought there would be much if any possibility that
the  Taxpayer  would  have  engaged  that  company.
It  would  simply
not have been commercially acceptable.  Lastly, it should be noted
that Company X acted only for the Taxpayer; it had no other clients.”

The Board in fact held in Case No. D94/99 14 IRBRD 603 that the
12.
relationship  between  the  taxpayer  and  the  service  company  was  artificial  and
largely,  if  not  totally,  fictitious  and  therefore should be disregarded under the
In  reaching  its  conclusion  the
provisions  of  section  61  of  the  Ordinance.
Board emphasised the need for the parties involved to act on an arm’s length
basis if a service company arrangement is to be acceptable.    At page 611 the
Board stated -

“24.
Mr B said that it was solely a matter for the Taxpayer and
Company  D  as  to  what  the  fair  and  reasonable  service  would  be.
We  accept  the  Revenue’s  submission  that  the  matter  had  to  be
assessed  objectively.  That  is  not  to  say  that  we  are  lifting  the
corporate veil.  Nor are we saying that the Taxpayer is not free to
decide its own affairs.  The Taxpayer is free to give away part of its
income  as  it  so  wishes  to  a  related  company  or  to  a  relative  or
indeed  to  any  third  party.    The  question  here  is  whether  that
payment  is  a  deductible  expense  in  law  when  computing  the
chargeable  profits.  This  question  must  be  answered  objectively.
The  agreement  between  the  Taxpayer  and  Company  D  does  not
preclude  us  from  examining  whether  the  payment  is  or  is  not  a
deductible expense incurred in the production of profits.

6

Such  expense  must  have  been  bona  fide  incurred  in  the
25.
production  of  profits.  We  must
look  at  all  surrounding
circumstances.    For  example,  the  relation  between  the  payer  and
the  payee  is  a  relevant  circumstance.    So  is  the  purpose  or  the
reason of the payment.  The basis and the breakdown of the amount
are also important.  The lack of a rational basis may lead us to the

commercial reality, and thus not bona fide incurred.

is  wholly  arbitrary,

lacking

that

In  this  case,  the  Taxpayer  has  given  us  very  little
26.
information as to how the service fee was incurred in the production
of  profits.  The  consultancy  agreement  referred  to  ‘firstly’  a  fee
$12,000 every month.  There is no explanation as to how this came
to be increased to $1,391,200 for the relevant period.  The minutes
of Company D’s board is, quite apart from the discrepancies pointed
out by the Revenue, totally silent as to the reasons for the substantial
increase.  We do not accept the contention in the Taxpayer’s letter
of  2  July  1996  that  the  fee  was  agreed  on  an  arm’s  length  basis.
There  is  no  explanation  as  to  how  the  fees  were  determined
‘periodically’  as  stated  in  that  letter.    The  schedule,  which  is
annexed  hereto  as  Appendix  B  and  relied  upon  by  Mr  B,  shows
irregular  payments  and  is  again  totally  unexplained.  There  is  no
information as to how these payments relate to services provided by
Company D.
It looks more like a list of sole proprietor’s drawings
from  his  own  business.  There  is  no  attempt  to  justify  any  of  the
sums  by  reference  to  the  service  provided  by  Company D.    In the
circumstances,  the  Taxpayer  failed  to  discharge  his  onus,  we  have
no hesitation in dismissing the appeal.”

13.
It  should  also  be  noted  that  apart  from  the  possibility  of  applying
section  61  where  a  service  company  arrangement  is  not  operated  on  a
commercial basis, the Department may also turn to section 61A if it is apparent
that the sole or dominant purpose of the arrangement is to obtain a tax benefit.
In  such  circumstances  the  existence  of  the  service  company  could  be
disregarded  and  the  tax  benefit  effectively  cancelled.  The  decision  of  the
Board of Review in Case No. D153/01 17 IRBRD 189 is an example where the
Commissioner  has  applied  section  61A  to  a  Type  II  service  company
arrangement.  The  Board  accepted  the  Commissioner’s  views  and  stated  at
page 209 -

7

As  to  section  61A,  we  also  accept  the  Commissioner’s
“
reasons in his determination to conclude that the Service Agreement
and the Employment Agreement were entered into by the Taxpayer
and  Company  B  for  the  sole  and  dominant  purpose  of  enabling  the
Taxpayer to obtain a tax benefit.”

ACCEPTABLE ARRANGEMENTS

14.
The  following  paragraphs  set  out  the  minimum  requirements  that
must be satisfied to support a management fee claim and also spell out the basis
on which the quantum of the deductible amount can generally be determined.

Arm’s length basis

There  may  well  be  circumstances  which  warrant  a  person  carrying
15.
on a trade, profession or business entering into an arrangement with a properly
constituted service company to obtain certain services and facilities which are
required in order for the person to derive chargeable profits.  However, for tax
purposes, it must be emphasised that where such an arrangement is entered into,
the  service  company  has  to  function  as  a  separate  business  operating  on  an
arm’s length basis in its dealings with the firm.  To support and be consistent
with  the  separate  status  of  each  party,  their  respective  rights  and  obligations
and  dealings  with  each  other  should  be  fully  documented.
Such
documentation should include -

•

the agreement under which the services are provided (it should
specify the relevant services, the basis on which fees are to be
paid, the period covered by the agreement, etc);

• 	 minutes  of  meetings  recording  approval  of  the  terms  of  the
service company agreement and any subsequent amendment;

•

invoices  and  receipts  in  respect  of  transactions  between  the
parties;

• 	 working papers in respect of the calculation of the fees charged

by the service company;

8

•

•

bank records in respect of each party; and

employment  contracts  in  respect  of  persons  employed  by  each
party.

In  the  generality  of  cases,  where  a  management  fee  is  paid  to  a
16.
service company on an arm’s length basis, the amount involved should reflect
the costs of the service company which are directly attributable to the relevant
services (e.g. salary paid to a typist) plus an appropriate mark-up to provide for
the operating expenses (e.g. rent of premises occupied by the service company
itself) and reasonable profit margin of the company.  These matters are further
discussed in the following paragraphs.

Qualifying services

In  order  to  determine  the  deductible  amount,  if  any,  in  respect  of  a
17.
management  fee  paid  by  a  firm,  the  starting  point  must  be  to  examine  the
nature of the services received from the service company.
In this regard, it is
necessary  to  identify  what  might,  for  convenience,  be  called  “qualifying
services” required by the firm in order to produce chargeable profits.

18.
The  Department’s  position  is  that,  broadly,  the  term  “qualifying
services” encompasses non-professional services which are required to provide
the  infrastructure  in  which  the  firm  operates  and  to  cater  for  its  day-to-day
operations.  Accordingly,  it  can  include  services  such  as  the  provision  of
premises,  staff  (e.g.  administrative,  secretarial,  clerical  and  cleaning  staff),
plant and equipment and miscellaneous supplies (i.e. stationery, photocopying,
medical,  etc).  The  term  does  not,  however,  extend  to  the  provision  of  any
services  to  a  firm  by  its  proprietor  or  partners  as  employees  of  a  service
company.
In the latter regard, the position of the Department reflects the view
that  such  an  arrangement  would  in  substance  amount  to  the  proprietor  or
partners seeking to employ themselves and therefore, on established principles,
it would not be effective for taxation purposes.

19.
Also  excluded  from  the  term  are  services  performed  by  other
professional  “fee-earners”  who  have  contracts  of  employment  with  a  service
company,  whether  or  not  they  also  hold  positions  as  ordinary  employees  or
It  is  pertinent  in  this  regard  that  where
salaried  partners  with  the  firm.

9

professionals  are  employed  by  the  service  company  instead  of  the  firm,  it
would generally be possible for the parties concerned to arrange for the service
company  to  directly  charge  the  client  for  the  relevant  services.    In  these
circumstances  the  deduction  allowed  in  respect  of  remuneration  of  the
professionals against the sum received would be limited to the amount actually
paid.  Accordingly, it is not considered that any mark-up could be justified in
commercial  terms  in  respect  of  the  portion  of  a  management  fee  relating  to
such  remuneration  where  the  firm  bills  the  client  even  though  the  service
company employs the professionals.

20.
A  reference  to  professionals  in  this  context  should  be  read  as
applying  to  persons  whose  day-to-day  duties  require  them  to  apply  expertise
they have acquired through training or experience in the profession of the party
for whom the duties are performed.  On the other hand, the term does not refer
in  a  profession  but  performs  only
to  a  person  who  has  expertise
non-fee-earning services.  For example, it should not be taken as applying to
an accountant who carries out administrative functions in a medical practice or
to a legally qualified person acting only as an office manager or librarian in a
firm of solicitors.

21.
It  should  be  noted  that  the  Department  does  not  accept  that  a
professional  can  “wear  two  hats”  so  that  what  might  be  called  administrative
duties  are  isolated  from  professional  duties  for  the  purpose  of  treating  the
former as qualifying services.  The position of the Department in this regard is
that,  irrespective  of  whether  the  person  concerned  is  a  proprietor,  partner  or
employee  of  the  firm,  such  administrative  duties  are  part  and  parcel  of  the
requirements  of  a  professional  position  and  do  not  warrant  separate
consideration.

Deduction allowable

22.
If a deduction is to be allowed, a firm must establish that the amount
claimed  in  respect  of  each  qualifying  service  falls  within  section  16  of  the
Ordinance and is not excluded under section 17.  To establish deductibility, it
must  provide  the  Department  with  a  detailed  statement  which  lists  the
qualifying services obtained from the service company.  The statement should
include in respect of each service -

10

•

•

•

an  explanation,  unless  the  reason  is  self-evident,  of  why  the
service is required by the firm in order to produce its chargeable
profits;

the amount included in the management fee claim in respect of
the  particular  service  (any  portion  applicable  to  non-business
use should be excluded); and

an explanation of why the amount should be accepted as being
commercially realistic and deductible.

As  was  mentioned  in  paragraph  16  above,  the  Department  accepts
23.
that a commercially realistic figure for a firm to pay for qualifying services can
reflect not only the costs of the service company which are directly attributable
to providing the relevant services (the “cost element”), but also an appropriate
margin  or  “mark-up”  to  cover  the  overheads  and  profits  of  the  service
It  follows  that  to  establish  the  deductibility  of  a  management  fee
company.
paid  for  qualifying  services,  a  firm  will  need  to  provide  the  Department  with
details  of  how  the  amount  claimed  has  been  calculated.
In  this  regard,  the
Department  will  accept  that  for  a  particular  year  of  assessment  the  cost
element is represented by the sum of the tax deductions, including depreciation
allowances, claimable by the service company in the same year of assessment
in  respect  of  expenditure  which  is  directly  attributable  to  the  provision  of  the
qualifying services.  As such, it should  not  include  any  amount  in  respect  of
expenditure which would not have qualified for a deduction or given rise to a
depreciation allowance if it had been incurred by the firm itself, instead of by
the service company, in order to obtain directly the relevant services.

24.
As it is not accepted that qualifying services can include any function
performed  by  a  proprietor  or  partner  of  a  firm,  expenditure  on  any
remuneration or benefits provided by a service company to such a person (e.g.
as a director’s fee) must not be reflected in the computation of the cost element
of qualifying services.  Attached as Annex A is a simple example illustrating
the adjustment required where expenditure on the provision of remuneration to
a connected party is involved.

Where  a  service  is  provided  which  is  used  partly  for  a  qualifying
25.
purpose and partly for some other purpose, the cost element should be reduced

11

  For  example,  if  an  item  of  plant
to  reflect  the  non-business  application.
provided  by  a  service  company  to  a  firm  is  only  used  by  the  latter  40%  for
business  purposes,  only  that  percentage  of  any  depreciation  allowance  and
related expenses should be included in the cost calculation.  Similarly, where
funds  are  borrowed  by  a  service  company  in  order  to  provide  qualifying
services  to  a  firm  and  for  some  other  purpose  (e.g.  to  purchase  a  property
occupied by a connected party), only that part of the interest  which  relates  to
the provision of the qualifying services should be included in the cost element.

26.
In  relation  to  the  question  of  what  is  an  appropriate  mark-up,
provided  that  the  overall  claim  does  not  exceed  the  expenditure  actually
incurred, a margin not exceeding 12.5% of the cost element will generally be
accepted as being commercially realistic.
It is considered that a margin of this
order provides a reasonable approximation of those applicable in arm’s length
business operations and reflects the views expressed by the Board of Review in
Case No. D94/99 14 IRBRD 603.

27.
Where  the  information  provided  by  a  taxpayer  is  insufficient  to
establish  that  the  deduction  claimed  in  respect  of  a  management  fee  is
commercially realistic, the presumption will arise that the fee was paid at least
in part for a purpose unrelated to the production of chargeable profits.
In such
a  case,  a  deduction  will  be  denied  to  the  extent  to  the  amount  in  excess  of  a
commercially realistic figure, provided that it can be ascertained or reasonably
estimated.
If  this  is  not  possible,  consideration  will  be  given  to  disallowing
the  claim  in  toto  in  accordance  with  the  view  expressed  by  the  Board  of
Review in Case No. D153/01 17 IRBRD 189.
