INTRODUCTION

It  is  a  canon  of  taxation  that  capital  expenditure  is  not  normally  an
allowable  deduction  in  ascertaining  the  assessable  profit  of  any  trade,
profession  or  business.    The  following  sections  were  added,  inter  alia,  to  the
Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  (the  Ordinance)  over  the  years  which  gave
important exceptions to the normal principle of allowing tax deductions:

SECTION 16C – PAYMENTS FOR TECHNICAL EDUCATION

Deduction of payments for technical education

Section  16C  was  introduced  to  allow  payments  made  by  a  person
2.
carrying on a trade or business for technical education.    Effective from the year
of  assessment  1998/99,  the  section  was  extended  to  a  person  carrying  on  a
profession.

3.
Under  section  16C(1),  a  person  carrying  on  a  trade,  profession  or
business in Hong Kong is allowed a tax deduction for any payment to be used
for  the  purposes  of  technical  education  related  to  that  trade,  profession  or
business at:

(a)    any university, university college or technical college; or

(b)    any  other  similar  institution  which  is  approved  by  the

Commissioner.

The recognition of the institution for this purpose shall start from whatever date
is specified in the approval.    This may be before or after the date of approval.
Prior  to  1  April  1996,  the  approval  was  given  by  the  Director  of  Education.
The approval given can be withdrawn at any time.

Deductible payments

For the purposes of section 16C, technical education is deemed to be
4.
related to a trade, profession or business if and only if it is of a kind specially
requisite for persons employed in that class of trade, profession or business as
per section 16C(2).

5.
The  deduction  applies  to  any  payment  to  an  approved  institution  to
be  used  for  the  purposes  of  technical  education  related  to  a  particular  trade,
profession or business.    It does not have to be directly for the education of any
person  or  persons  actually  employed  in  the  particular  business  at  the  time  of
payment.    The  deduction  extends  to  a  payment  to  establish  a  unit  or  for  the
general  maintenance  of  a  unit  at  an  approved  institution  so  as  to  provide
technical education of a kind specially suited or requisite to a particular class of
trade,  profession  or  business.    However,  contributions  in  response  to  appeals
made  for  funds  to  be  used  on  purchase  of  capital  equipment  would  not  be
allowable.

6.
Where  payments  are  made  for  the  technical  education  of  particular
persons,  the  payment  may  be  made  to  either  such  persons  or  the  approved
institution.

The  intention  of  section  16C  is  to  broaden  and  not  to  restrict  what
7.
would ordinarily be allowable deductions.    So expenditure by an employer on
the  technical  training  or  education  of  any  of  his  employees  may  be  allowed
under section 16(1) even if the institution is not an approved institution.

SECTION 16F – EXPENDITURE ON BUILDING REFURBISHMENT

Deduction of expenditure on building refurbishment

8.
Section 16F was introduced as from the year of assessment 1996/97.
For  the  years  of  assessment  1996/97  and  1997/98,  a  deduction  is  allowed  for
capital expenditure incurred on the renovation or refurbishment of a hotel by a
person who carries on  business as an owner  or operator of a hotel to produce
chargeable  profits.    With  effect  from  the  year  of  assessment  1998/99,  the
deduction was extended to cover capital expenditure incurred on the renovation
or refurbishment of a building other than a domestic building by a person (who

2

may be an owner or tenant of a building) in the production of chargeable profits.
Any  expenditure  allowed  under  this  section  will  not  qualify  for  depreciation
allowances under Part 6 of the Ordinance.

The term “domestic building or structure” is defined in section 16F.

9.
It means any building or structure used for habitation, but does not include any
building  or  structure  used  as  a  hotel  or  guesthouse.    It  is  the  actual  use  or
intended  use  of  the  building,  not  the  type  of  the  building,  that  counts.    The
terms  “hotel”  and  “guesthouse”  have  the  same  meaning  as  in  the  Hotel  and
Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance (Cap. 349).    Thus, the deduction does
not apply to buildings used for letting for residential purposes or as directors’ or
staff quarters.

Timing of deduction

10.
Capital expenditure meeting the requirements under section 16F(1) is
allowed as a deduction by five equal instalments, the first of which is allowed
in  the  basis  period  during  which  the  expenditure  was  incurred  and  the
remaining  four  instalments  in  the  basis  periods  for  the  next  succeeding  four
years  of  assessment  as  per  section  16F(2).    If  the  relevant  property  is  sold
before the instalments are fully granted, the person entitled to the instalments is
still granted the instalments as if the property has not yet been sold.

Qualifying expenditure

To  qualify  for  deduction,  the  expenditure  incurred  must  be  a
11.
renovation  or  refurbishment  in  nature.
  The  words  “renovation”  and
“refurbishment”  are  not  defined  in  the  Ordinance.    According  to  the  Shorter
Oxford  English  Dictionary,  “renovation”  means  renewal  or  restoration,  and
“refurbishment” is renovation.

12.
Renovation  or  refurbishment  expenditure  can  be  either  capital  or
revenue in nature, depending on whether the expenditure results in improving
or repairing the building or structure concerned.    Renovation expenditure of a
capital  nature  is  deductible  in  the  manner  specified  under  section  16F  while
renovation expenditure of a revenue nature is deductible under section 16(1)(e).

3

The  Shorter  Oxford  English  Dictionary  defines  “repair”  as  “the
13.
action or process of restoring something to unimpaired condition by replacing
or fixing worn or damaged parts”.    In the Privy Council case of Auckland Gas
Co. Ltd. v CIR [2000] STC 527, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said at pages 532
and 533 that the solution to the question of whether work constituted repair or
replacement was not to be found by any rigid test or description.    The answer
depends  on  a  consideration  of  all  the  circumstances.
  An  important
consideration is whether the work is of such a nature and scale as to change the
character of the relevant asset.    Where the work changed the character of the
asset so that a significant portion of the asset has been upgraded, the work is of
capital nature.

14.
Thus, the question of improvement or repair to a building or structure
is  one  of  fact  and  degree  and  close  examination  of  the  facts  of  the  particular
case  is  required.    The  commonly  used  test  for  this  purpose  is  the  “entirety”
test.    If  the  entirety  of  a  building  or  structure  is  replaced,  it  is  improvement;
and  if  part  of  the  entirety  is  replaced,  it  is  repair.    In  Lurcott  v  Wakely  &
Wheeler [1911] 1 KB 905, Buckley LJ said at page 924 that repair is restoration
by  renewal  or  replacement  of  subsidiary  parts  of  a  whole.    Renewal,  as
distinguished  from  repair,  is  reconstruction  of  the  entirety,  meaning  by  the
entirety  not  necessarily  the  whole  but  substantially  the  whole  subject-matter
under discussion.

Non-qualifying expenditure

15.
expenditure incurred:

Section 16F(4) provides that the deduction does not apply to capital

(a)

for  a  building  which  is  used  or  intended  to  be  used  as  a
domestic building;

(b)

to enable a building to be first used substantially by the person
for the production of chargeable profits;

(c)

to  enable  a  building  to  be  used  for  a  purpose  different  from
that  for  which  it  was  used  immediately  before  the  capital
expenditure was incurred.

4

16.
Capital expenditure incurred on the initial construction, decoration or
fitting out of a commercial building or structure, and expenditure on alteration
of a building to enable a different usage do not qualify for the deduction under
section 16F(1) but they may qualify for commercial building allowance under
section 33A.

SECTION 16G – CAPITAL EXPENDITURE ON THE PROVISION OF A
PRESCRIBED FIXED ASSET

Deduction of capital expenditure on prescribed fixed asset

Section 16G was effective from the year of assessment 1998/99 and
17.
onwards  to  allow  a  deduction  for  specified  capital  expenditure  incurred  by  a
person  on  the  provision  of  a  prescribed  fixed  asset,  by  providing  for  a  100%
immediate write-off in respect of the expenditure.

Specified capital expenditure

18.
The term “specified capital expenditure” is defined in section 16G(6)
to  mean  any  capital  expenditure  incurred  by  a  person  on  the  provision  of  a
“prescribed fixed asset”, but does not include:

(a)

capital  expenditure  that  may  be  deducted  under  any  other
section of Part 4 of the Ordinance;

(b)

capital expenditure incurred under a hire-purchase agreement.

Prescribed fixed asset

19.

“Prescribed fixed asset” is defined in section 16G(6) to mean:

(a)

the  following  items  of  machinery  or  plant  specified  in  the
First  Part  of  the  Table  annexed  to  Rule  2  of  the  Inland
Revenue  Rules  as  is  used  specifically  and  directly  for  any
manufacturing process –

5

Type and blocks

Item  Nature of the assets
16
20  Bleaching and finishing machinery and plant
24
26

Electronics manufacturing machinery and plant
Plastic manufacturing machinery and plant including
moulds
Silk manufacturing machinery and plant
Sulphuric and nitric acid plant
Textile  and  clothing  manufacturing  machinery  and
plant

28
29
31

33  Weaving, spinning, knitting and sewing machinery
35  Any other machinery or plant, not specified in items

1 to 34

(b)

computer hardware, other than that which is an integral part of
any machinery or plant;

(c)

computer software and computer systems;

but does not include an “excluded fixed asset”.

Excluded fixed asset

The term “excluded fixed asset” is defined in section 16G(6) to mean

20.
a  fixed  asset  in  which  any  person  holds  rights  as  a  lessee  under  a  lease.
Section  2(1)  defines  “lease”,  in  relation  to  any  machinery  or  plant,  to  include
any arrangement under which a right to use the machinery  or plant  is granted
by the owner of the machinery or plant to another person.

In  Braitrim  (Far  East)  Limited  v  CIR  [2013]  4  HKLRD  329,  the
21.
Court  of  Appeal  held  that  the  word  “lease”  in  section  16G(6)  was  to  be
understood  in  accordance  with  the  definition  in  section  2(1)  instead  of  its
commonly  understood  legal  meaning.    Delivering  the  unanimous  decision  of
the Court, Barma JA said at page 339 that the legislative intention was to limit
the  scope  of  the  section  16G  deduction  so  that  it  was  not  available  in  cases
where the fixed asset in question was the subject of an arrangement by which a
person other than its owner was granted a right to use it.

6

Machinery  or  plant  may  be  provided  by  a  person  carrying  on
22.
business  in  Hong  Kong  to  a  Mainland  Chinese  enterprise  for  manufacturing
products  sold  to  the  person.    On  the  authority  of  Braitrim,  this  arrangement
constituted the granting of rights to use the machinery or plant to the Mainland
Chinese  enterprise,  which  falls  within  the  extended  definition  of  “lease”  in
section 2(1).    In such case, the Mainland Chinese enterprise is holding rights
in the machinery or plant as a lessee under the lease.    The machinery or plant
should be regarded as “excluded fixed asset” and thus the expenditure incurred
by the person on the machinery or plant cannot be deducted under section 16G.

Manufacturing process

23.
To qualify for a deduction under section 16G, the machinery or plant
must be used specifically and directly for any manufacturing process.    As the
term “manufacturing process” is not defined in the Ordinance, we have to refer
to  its  ordinary  meaning.    In  general,  it  means  a  series  of  activities  or
operations,  usually  carried  out  inside  a  factory  or  any  other  similar  premises,
for the creation of any new product.

Though  the  term  “manufacturing  process”  is  capable  of  a  wide
24.
interpretation, it does not include construction.    In fact, bulldozers and graders
commonly  used  in  construction  works  are  not  included  in  the  definition  of
prescribed fixed asset in section 16G(6).

Computer hardware

25.
Prescribed  fixed  asset  includes  computer  hardware  which  is  not  an
integral part of any machinery or plant.    In other words, stand-alone computer
hardware  qualifies  for  deduction  but  computer  hardware  forming  an  integral
part  of  an  item  of  machinery  or  plant  will  not  be  granted  the  section  16G
deduction  unless  the  machinery  or  plant  containing  the  computer  hardware
happens to be a prescribed fixed asset.

Computer software and computer system

Capital  expenditure  incurred  on  computer  software  and  a  computer
26.
system used in the production of chargeable profits is deductible under section
16G.    This includes the relevant consultancy fees and associated costs.

7

Prescribed fixed asset used partly in the production of profits

27.
Where  a  prescribed  fixed  asset  is  used  partly  in  the  production  of
chargeable  profits  and  partly  for  other  purposes,  the  deduction  shall  be  such
part of the specified capital expenditure as is proportionate to the extent of the
use of the asset in the production of the chargeable profits.

Sale of prescribed fixed asset

28.
Where the prescribed fixed asset in respect of which a deduction has
been allowed is sold, the sale proceeds, not otherwise chargeable to profits tax
and not exceeding the amount of deduction previously allowed, shall be treated
as a trading receipt.

29.
On  sale  of  a  prescribed  fixed  asset  used  partly  in  the  production  of
chargeable  profits,  such  part  of  the  sale  proceeds  as  is  proportionate  to  the
extent  to  which  the  deduction  has  been  allowed,  not  otherwise  chargeable  to
profits tax and not exceeding the amount of deduction previously allowed, shall
be treated as a trading receipt.

30.
The deemed trading receipt shall accrue and be assessable at the time
of  sale.    If  the  sale  occurs  on  or  after  the  date  on  which  the  business  is
permanently discontinued, the deemed trading receipt shall accrue on the date
immediately before the discontinuance.

The  time  of  sale  of  a  prescribed  fixed  asset  is  either  the  time  of
31.
completion of the sale of the asset, or the time when possession of the asset is
given, whichever is the earlier.

32.
Where a prescribed fixed asset is sold and the seller has control over
the buyer, or vice versa, or both are under the common control of some other
person,  or  the  buyer  and  seller  are  husband  and  wife,  the  Commissioner  may
determine the true market value of the asset if he is of the opinion that the sale
price does not represent its true market value.

8

Destruction of prescribed fixed asset

33.
Where a prescribed fixed asset is destroyed, the asset shall be treated
as  if  it  had  been  sold  immediately  before  the  destruction.    Any  insurance
money  or  other  compensation  received  and  any  money  received  in  respect  of
the remains of the asset are to be treated as the sale proceeds.

Capital expenditure incurred prior to commencement of business

34.
Where  a  taxpayer  incurs  specified  capital  expenditure  on  the
provision of a prescribed fixed asset for the purposes of a trade, profession or
business which is about to commence, the expenditure shall be treated as if it
has  been  incurred  on  the  first  day  on  which  the  taxpayer  carries  on  the  trade,
profession or business.

SECTIONS 16H to 16L – CAPTIAL EXPENDITURE IN RELATION TO
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FACILITIES

Deduction of expenditure on environmental protection facilities

35.
The  Revenue  Ordinance  2008  was  enacted,  inter  alia,  to  accelerate
profits  tax  deduction  for  capital  expenditure  on  environmental  protection
machinery  or  installations  from  the  year  of  assessment  2008/09.    The  Inland
Revenue  (Amendment)  (No.  3)  Ordinance  2010  allowed  the  acceleration  of
profits  tax  deduction  for  capital  expenditure  incurred  on  the  provision  of
environment-friendly  vehicles  from  the  year  of  assessment  2010/11.    The
Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 9) Ordinance 2018 further allowed profits
tax  deduction  of  capital  expenditure  incurred  for  procuring  environmental
protection  installations  in  full  in  one  year  of  assessment  instead  of  over  five
years  of  assessment  from  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19.    The  relevant
provisions are as follows:

43.
EEBIs include four types of central building services installations (i.e.
lighting  installations,  air-conditioning  installations,  electrical  installations  and
lift  and  escalator  installations).    The  building  envelope  itself  is  not  a
qualifying installation but commercial building allowance under section 33A or
industrial building allowance under section 34 may be granted on the costs of
construction as appropriate.

The Hong Kong Energy Efficiency Registration Scheme for Buildings

The  HKEERSB  is  a  voluntary  scheme  which  aims  to  promote  the
44.
enhancement of energy efficiency of buildings in Hong Kong by commending
buildings/  premises  achieving  better  energy  efficient  performance  beyond  the
statutory  requirements  as  prevailing  at  the  time  of  submitting  the  application.
In order to apply for registration of EEBIs under the HKEERSB, applicants are
required  to  provide  certification  for  the  buildings/  premises  equipped  with
EEBIs  showing  their  compliance  with  the  assessment  standards  under  the
building  environmental  assessment  systems  (BEAS)  managed  by  the  Hong
Kong  Green  Building  Council,  i.e.  the  BEAM  Plus  Assessment  System,  or

13

other internationally recognised BEAS.    Upon completion of each registration,
EMSD will issue a compliance certificate for the building/ premises to certify
that  it  complies  with  the  standards  under  BEAS.    The  EMSD  maintains  a
register  of  the  buildings/  premises  which  have  been  registered  under  the
HKEERSB.    The  register  can  be  accessed  at  the  web  site  of  the  EMSD:
www.emsd.gov.hk.

Timing of deduction

Capital  expenditure  for

45.
the  provision  of  any  environmental
protection machinery or environment-friendly vehicle is allowable in full in the
basis period for the year of assessment in which it was incurred as per section
16I(2).

46.
Before the year of assessment 2018/19, capital expenditure incurred
in  relation  to  any  environmental  protection  installation  is  allowed  as  a
deduction  by  five  equal  instalments.    Section  16I(3)  provides  that  the  first
instalment is allowed in the basis period for the year of assessment in which the
expenditure  was  incurred,  and  the  remaining  four  instalments  in  the  basis
periods  for  the  next  succeeding  four  years  of  assessment.    For  the  year  of
assessment  2018/19  and  thereafter,  section  16I(3B)  provides  that  capital
expenditure  in  relation  to  such  installations  is  deducted  in  full  in  the  basis
period  for  the  year  of  assessment  in  which  it  was  incurred.    Section  16I(3A)
allows  any  part  of  expenditure  that  remains  to  be  deducted  for  the  year  of
assessment 2018/19 to be fully deducted in that year.

47.
If  capital  expenditure  in  relation  to  an  environmental  protection
facility  is  claimed  for  deduction  in  a  tax  return,  the  Assessor  will  allow  the
deduction,  provided  the  required  details  are  properly  disclosed.    Taking  into
account that it may take some time to obtain the BEAS certificate and complete
the  entire  procedure  for  registration  under  the  HKEERSB,  the  Commissioner
will  adopt  a  liberal  approach  in  considering  deduction  for  EEBIs.    For  those
EEBIs  the  registration  process  of  which  has  not  been  completed  under  the
HKEERSB, deduction  will be allowed in the  year of assessment in  which the
relevant capital expenditure was incurred by a taxpayer on the conditions that
the  taxpayer  provides  the  required  details  about  the  application  status  for
registration  of  the  EEBIs  and  undertakes  to  take  all  reasonable  steps  to
complete the registration.

14

Enquiries will be raised regarding the application for registration of
48.
EEBIs  under  the  HKEERSB  upon  a  review  of  the  deduction  claim.    In
practice,  the  compliance  certificate  issued  by  the  EMSD  may  be  provided  to
show that the registration of the EEBIs under HKEERSB has been completed.
If  the  application  is  ceased,  withdrawn  or  refused  such  that  the  registration
process  cannot  be  completed,  profits  tax  or  additional  profits  tax  assessment
will be raised to withdraw the deduction previously granted within the six-year
time limit under section 60(1).

Example 1

Under a building contract for the construction of EEBIs, Company-HK
agreed to pay $15,000,000, $20,000,000 and $30,000,000 in May 2016,
May  2017  and  May  2018  respectively.    Company-HK  applied  for
registration  of  the  building  equipped  with  the  EEBIs  under  the
HKEERSB  and
in  July  2019.
registration  was  completed
Company-HK  closed  its  accounts  on  30  September  each  year  and
deductions were claimed under section 16I(3) for the payments made in
May 2016 and May 2017 by five equal instalments.

Registration  of  the  EEBIs  under  the  HKEERSB  had  not  been
completed  during  the  years  of  assessment  2016/17  to  2018/19.
However,  if  Company-HK  provided  all  the  required  details  about  the
application  status  and  undertook  to  take  all  reasonable  steps  to
complete the registration, deductions would be computed as follows:

Year of assessment 2016/17
(Basis period: 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016)

Deduction allowed
- 1st payment ($15,000,000  ×  20%)

2018/19 Company-HK claimed under section 16I(3A) full deduction
for the remaining balances of the payments  made in May 2016  and
May 2017.

Deductions would be computed as follows:

Year of assessment 2018/19
(Basis period: 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2018)

Deduction allowed
- 1st payment ($15,000,000 x 60%)

failed  to  complete  the  registration  of  the  building  under  the
HKEERSB.

Additional  profits  tax  assessments  for  the  years  of  assessment
2016/17  to  2018/19  would  be  raised  on  Company-HK  to  withdraw
the  total  deduction  of  $47,000,000  ($3,000,000  +  $7,000,000  +
$37,000,000) previously allowed under section 60(1).

Facilities used partly in the production of profits

49.
If  an  environmental  protection  facility  is  used  partly  in  the
production  of  chargeable  profits  and  partly  for  other  purposes,  section  16I(4)
provides  that  the  deduction  shall  be  such  part  of  the  specified  capital
expenditure  that  is  proportionate  to  the  extent  of  the  use  of  the  facility  in  the
production of the chargeable profits.

Capital expenditure incurred prior to commencement of business

50.
Where  a  taxpayer  incurs  specified  capital  expenditure  in  relation  to
an  environmental  protection  facility  for  the  purposes  of  a  trade,  profession  or
business which is about to commence, the expenditure shall be treated as if it
has  been  incurred  on  the  first  day  on  which  the  taxpayer  carries  on  the  trade,
profession or business.

Sale and destruction

Environmental protection machinery or installation

51.
Where  an  environmental  protection  machinery  or  installation  in
respect of which a deduction has been allowed is sold, the relevant proceeds of
sale,  not  otherwise  chargeable  to  profits  tax  and  not  exceeding  the  amount  of
deduction  previously  allowed,  shall  be  treated  as  a  trading  receipt  as  per
sections 16J(2), (3A) and (3B).

Section  16J(3)  provides

installation in respect of which capital expenditure was incurred before the year
of assessment 2018/19 and a deduction has been allowed by instalments is sold:

(a)

(b)

if  the  unallowed  amount  of  the  installation  exceeds  the
relevant proceeds of sale, the excess shall be deducted for the
year  of  assessment  in  the  basis  period  during  which  the  sale
occurs; or

if the relevant proceeds of sale exceed the unallowed amount
of the installation, or if there is not an unallowed amount, the
excess or the relevant proceeds of sale, as the case may be, not
otherwise  chargeable  to  profits  tax  and  not  exceeding  the

17

amount of deduction previously allowed, shall be treated as a
trading receipt.

53.
The  deemed  trading  receipt  in  respect  of  the  environmental
protection  machinery  or  installation  sold  shall  accrue  and  be  assessable  at  the
time of the sale.    If the sale occurs on or after the date on which the business is
permanently discontinued, the deemed trading receipt shall accrue on the date
immediately before the discontinuance.

profits, the proceeds of sale of the facility; or

if  the  facility  is  used  partly  in  the  production  of  chargeable
profits,  such  part  of  the  proceeds  of  sale  of  the  facility  as  is
proportionate  to  the  extent  to  which  the  deduction  has  been
allowed.

55.
The  term  “unallowed  amount”,  in  relation  to  an  environmental
protection  installation  in  respect  of  which  a  deduction  has  been  allowed  and
which is subsequently sold, means:

(a)

(b)

if  the  installation  is  used  wholly  in  the  production  of
chargeable profits, the amount of specified capital expenditure
incurred in relation to the installation that is still unallowed as
at the time of sale; or

if  the  installation  is  used  partly  in  the  production  of
chargeable  profits,  such  part  of  the  amount  referred  to  in
paragraph (a) above as is proportionate to the extent to which
the deduction has been allowed.

Facts  are  the  same  as  in  Example  2  but  in  August  2019
Company-HK sold the EEBIs for $20,000,000.

Year of Assessment 2019/20
(Basis period: 1 October 2018 to 30 September 2019)

The relevant proceeds of sale of $20,000,000 do not exceed the total
deduction of $65,000,000 ($3,000,000 + $7,000,000 + $55,000,000)
previously allowed and would be wholly treated as trading receipts.

Environment-friendly vehicle

57.
Where  an  environment-friendly  vehicle  in  respect  of  which  a
deduction  has  been  allowed  is  sold  before  the  cessation  of  business,  the
relevant  proceeds  of  sale,  not  otherwise  chargeable  to  profits  tax  and  not
exceeding  the  amount  of  deduction  previously  allowed,  shall  be  treated  as  a
trading receipt accruing and be assessable at the time of the sale as per section
16J(2A).

Where an environment-friendly vehicle is destroyed or stolen before
58.
the cessation of business, the vehicle is deemed to have been sold immediately
before  the  destruction  or  theft.    Any  insurance  money  or  other  compensation
received  and  any  money  derived  from  the  remains  of  such  vehicle  are  to  be
treated as the proceeds of that sale.

59.
If  an  environment-friendly  vehicle  in  respect  of  which  a  deduction
has been allowed to a person has not been sold, destroyed or stolen before the
cessation of business, the vehicle is deemed to have been sold and the person is
deemed to have received the proceeds of that sale immediately before business
cessation.    The  amount  of  proceeds  is  such  amount  the  Commissioner  may
consider the vehicle would have realized had it been sold in the open market at
the time of business cessation.    If the vehicle is sold, destroyed or stolen on or
within  12  months  after  the  cessation  of  business,  the  person  may  claim  an
adjustment to the amount deemed to have been received by him.

20

Time of sale

60.
The time of sale of an environmental protection facility is either the
time of completion of the sale of the facility, or the time when possession of the
facility is given, whichever is the earlier.

Controlled sale

Where an environmental protection facility is sold and the seller has
61.
control over the buyer, or vice versa, or both are under the common control of
some  other  person,  or  the  buyer  and  seller  are  husband  and  wife,  the
Commissioner may determine the true market value of the facility if he is of the
opinion that the sale price does not reflect its true market value.

Environmental protection installations owned before 1 April 2018

62.

Where, before 1 April 2018, a person:

(a)

incurred capital expenditure on the construction of a building
or structure that is an environmental protection installation or
is  entitled  to  the  relevant  interest  in  relation  to  the  capital
expenditure incurred;

(b)

no deduction has previously been allowed under Part 4 of the
Ordinance for the expenditure; and

(c)

he makes an election,

the person is taken to have incurred specified capital expenditure in relation to
the building or structure on 1 April 2018 as per section 16L(1).

63.
The  specified  capital  expenditure  in  relation  to  the  installation  is  to
be the residue of expenditure under Part 6 of the Ordinance incurred in relation
to the building or structure immediately before 1 April 2018.

64.
A  person  who  wishes  to  be  taken  to  have  incurred  the  specified
capital  expenditure  on  1  April  2018  and  claim  a  deduction  in  relation  to  the
expenditure  for  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19  may  make  an  election  in
writing  within  one  month  after  a  notice  of  the  assessment  for  that  year  of

21

assessment is given to him.    The election, once made, is irrevocable.

Example 7

In  October  2017,  Company-HK  incurred  capital  expenditure  on  the
construction  of  EEBIs.    The  installation  was  registered  under  the
HKEERSB  in  May  2018.    Company-HK  closed  its  accounts  on  31
March each year.

Year of Assessment 2017/18
(Basis period: 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018)
Company-HK  claimed  and  was  granted  commercial  building
allowance in respect of the EEBIs.

Year of Assessment 2018/19
(Basis period: 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019)
Company-HK  would  be  allowed  to  make  an  election  such  that  the
specified capital expenditure could be taken as incurred on 1 April
2018.    Full  deduction  would  be  allowed  for  the  residue  of
expenditure  incurred  in  relation  to  the  installation  immediately
before 1 April 2018.
