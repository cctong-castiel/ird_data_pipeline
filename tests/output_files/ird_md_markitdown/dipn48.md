iiINTRODUCTION

Context for APA

Many  multinational  enterprises  (MNEs)  operating  in  Hong  Kong
participate regularly in world trade with sizable controlled transactions across the
border.      As  a  necessary  consequence,  there  has  been  an  increasing  focus  and
emphasis on transfer pricing.  The Commissioner recognises that these MNEs face
transfer pricing risks internationally and domestically.

2.
Charged with administering Hong Kong’s tax system, the Commissioner
faces  risks  posed  by  profit  shifting  and  transfer  pricing.      By  entering  into  an
advance pricing arrangement (APA), the Commissioner places an explicit emphasis
on  assuring  Hong  Kong’s  tax  base  by  working  with  MNEs  to  ensure  profits  are
reflective of the true economic contribution made in Hong Kong.

MNEs will also seek to manage and mitigate their transfer pricing risks.
3.
An APA provides a tool for them to manage and mitigate such risks on a prospective
basis.  Having regard to the totality of the controlled transactions, the APA should
provide a practical and commercial  outcome  for MNEs with operations in Hong
Kong.

Definition of APA

4.
An  APA  is  an  arrangement  that  determines,  in  advance  of  controlled
transactions,  an  appropriate  set  of  criteria  (e.g.  method,  comparables  and
appropriate  adjustments  thereto,  critical  assumptions  as  to  future  events)  for  the
determination of the transfer pricing for those transactions over a fixed period of
time.

In this Practice Note, controlled transactions refer not only to transactions
5.
between  associated  persons,  but  also  transactions  between  different  parts  of  the
same person1.  In addition, attribution of profits to a permanent establishment of a
non-Hong Kong resident person in Hong Kong can be the subject matter of an APA.

1   An APA can cover domestic controlled transactions.  Transactions between different parts of the same
person refer to internal dealings between: (a) an overseas branch and the Hong Kong head office; (b) the
Hong Kong branch and the overseas head office; and (c) the Hong Kong branch and an overseas branch
of a non-Hong Kong resident person.

An APA will not agree precisely the actual profit which should be taxed
6.
in  Hong  Kong  in  the  future.    It  should  fix  arrangements  according  to  the  arm’s
length  principle  for  determining  the  transfer  pricing  outcomes  for  the  future
transactions.   In general, an APA will cover a period of 3 to 5 years.

Types of APA

Unilateral APA

7.
A  unilateral  APA  is  an  arrangement  between  the  Commissioner  and  a
person  concerning  the  transfer  pricing  of  controlled  transactions.    It  does  not
involve the agreement with the competent authority of a foreign jurisdiction.   As
such, it does not guarantee the agreement of the competent authority of a foreign
jurisdiction to the arrangement made.

8.
If  the  tax  administration  of  a  foreign  jurisdiction  involved  forms  a
different view as to the application of the arm’s length principle to the controlled
transactions  covered  by  a  unilateral  APA,  double  taxation  may  arise.    If  the
jurisdiction  is  a  territory  outside  Hong  Kong  with  which  a  double  taxation
arrangement (DTA) has been made (i.e. DTA territory), the Commissioner will seek
to support the transfer pricing outcomes of the unilateral APA during the mutual
agreement procedure (MAP), but may have to deviate from the transfer price under
the original terms of the unilateral APA to arrive at a solution with the competent
authority of the DTA territory.

Bilateral APA

A  bilateral  APA  is  an  arrangement  between  the  Commissioner,  as  the
9.
competent authority of Hong Kong, and the competent authority of a DTA territory
concerning the transfer pricing of controlled transactions.   It is concluded under
the MAP Article of the relevant DTA.   Upon mutual agreement having been made,
the competent authority of each side confirms the terms of the APA in writing with
the  person  concerned  and  agrees  to  be  bound  by  the  terms.      A  bilateral  APA
therefore provides certainty to the person that double taxation will not arise.

Multilateral APA

10.
A multilateral APA is an arrangement between the Commissioner and the
competent  authorities  of  two  or  more  DTA  territories  concerning  the  transfer

2

pricing of controlled transactions.  It strictly involves multiple and complementary
bilateral  APAs  concluded  under  the  MAP  Articles  of  the  relevant  DTAs.    A
multilateral APA binds the competent authorities of all relevant DTA territories and
provides certainty to the person concerned that double taxation will not arise.  It
may be more appropriate where there is essentially only one activity, but several
persons  or  parts  of  a  person  contribute  to  it.      For  example,  where  an  enterprise
resident in Hong Kong is engaged in global financial trading through branches in
Jurisdiction-F1 and Jurisdiction-F2, it may be appropriate for similar agreements to
be  reached  between  Hong  Kong  and  Jurisdiction-F1  and  Hong  Kong  and
Jurisdiction-F2  in  order  to  determine  how  the  profits  from  the  activity  are  to  be
allocated to each of the 3 jurisdictions, with a view to eliminating double taxation.

Advantages of APA

An  APA  provides  certainty  on  an  appropriate

transfer  pricing
11.
methodology in relation to the controlled transactions.  APAs concluded bilaterally
or  multilaterally  with  DTA  territories  provide  an  increased  level  of  certainty  in
Hong Kong and these territories, lessen the likelihood of double taxation and may
proactively prevent transfer pricing disputes.

12.
The APA process, which is voluntary, supplements the objection, appeal
and other DTA mechanisms for resolving transfer pricing issues.  It prevents costly
and  time  consuming  audit  and  litigation  of  transfer  pricing  issues.    Its  scope  is
flexible and it may cover all or part of the transfer pricing issues of a person.  The
discussion of complex transfer pricing issues in a non-adversarial environment can
stimulate the free flow of information and promote mutual understanding.

An  APA  requires  the  compliance  with  particular  requirements  and
13.
depends on critical assumptions being met.  If the requirements are complied with
and the assumptions are met, the Commissioner will not impose additional profits
tax on the covered controlled transactions other than the tax payable on the pricing
worked out under the APA.  Upon the expiration of the period covered by the APA,
the person who has applied for the APA may seek to renew it, thus prolonging the
advantages.

THE STATUTORY APA REGIME

Relevant legislation

14.
The  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  (No.  6)  Ordinance  2018  (the
Amendment Ordinance) was enacted in July 2018.  The Amendment Ordinance has
incorporated,  among  other  things,  the  international  transfer  pricing  rules  into
Division 2 of Part 8AA of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (IRO).  Provisions have
also been added in Division 4 of Part 8AA to allow the Commissioner and a person
to  agree  in  advance  on  a  method  for  computing  the  person’s  profits  under  such
transfer pricing rules in an arrangement (i.e. an APA).  The APA can be unilateral,
bilateral or multilateral.

15.
The main provisions in Division 4 of Part 8AA, the supplementary rules
in  Schedule  17H  and  the  penal  provisions  in  Part  14  relating  to  APA  are
summarised as follows:

Main provisions in Division 4 of Part 8AA

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

Section 50AAP allows the Commissioner to make an APA with a
person  relating  to  how  the  person’s  income  or  loss  is  to  be
computed under section 50AAF or 50AAK for a fixed period of
time.

Section 50AAQ requires a person, in respect of whom an APA is
made, to disclose the existence of the APA made in the person’s
return.

Section 50AAR empowers the Commissioner to revoke, cancel or
revise an APA.

Section  50AAS  imposes  obligations  on  a  person,  in  respect  of
whom an APA is made, to notify the Commissioner of a breach of
any critical assumption and to provide the Commissioner with all
reports  (e.g.  annual  compliance  report)  and  other  information  as
required under the APA.

4

(e)

(f)

(g)

(h)

Section 50AAT requires a person, in respect of whom APA is made
for a period, to retain for not less than 7 years after the end of the
period all the relevant records and data.

Section 50AAU empowers the Commissioner to resolve questions
through the MAP with the competent authority of a DTA territory
for the purpose of making an APA.

Section  50AAV  refers  to  Schedule  17H  which  prescribes  the
detailed requirements for an APA application and the fees payable
for the application.

Section  50AAW  provides  that  no  liability  is  to  rest  on  the
Government,  the  Commissioner  or  any  other  public  officer  in
respect of the exercise of any power or performance of any duty in
good faith in relation to an APA or an APA application.

Supplementary rules in Schedule 17H

(i)

Section 2 prescribes the content of an APA application.

(j)

(k)

Section 3 requires the applicant to provide further information for
purposes of an APA application if required by the Commissioner.

Section 4 empowers the Commissioner to appoint an independent
expert to inquire into  and report  on any  matters in relation to  an
APA application.

(l)

Section 5 allows an applicant to withdraw an APA application by
written notice to the Commissioner.

(m)  Section 6 requires the Commissioner to give the applicant a written
notice stating the decision and the reasons if the making of an APA
is refused.

(n)

Section  7  specifies  the  fees  payable  and  deposit  required  for  an
APA application.

5

Penal provisions in Part 14 relating to APA

(o)

Sections 80(2L), 82(1AAB) and 82(1AAC) provide that a person
commits  an  offence  if  the  person  makes  an  incorrect  statement,
provides incorrect information or omits anything from a statement
made  or  information  provided,  or  fails  to  comply  with  the
requirements for provision of information, making of notification
and  record  keeping,  in  connection  with  an  APA  or  an  APA
application.

(p)

Sections  80(2M),  80(2N),  80(2O),  80(2P),  82(1A)  and  82A(1H)
impose  penalties  in  relation  to  the  offences  in  subparagraph  (o)
above.

The provisions and supplementary rules in paragraph 15 apply to a year
16.
of assessment beginning on or after 1 April 2018.   Section 4(5) of Schedule 44
provides  that  the  principles  developed  in  an  APA  are  not  prevented  from  being
applied under section 50AAQ(4) in relation to a period which wholly or partly falls
before 1 April 2018 if the arrangement is made on or after 1 April 2018.

Mutual expectations under the APA process

While  the  APA  process  is  a  statutory  one,  it  is  a  co-operative  process
17.
requiring a relationship of mutual trust to achieve an effective outcome.  In building
mutual trust as part of a constructive relationship, expectations that the stakeholders
may have of each other include the following:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

all  parties  will  co-operate  fully  with  each  other,  including
undertaking open and ongoing dialogue in the development of the
APA;

each APA request will be treated on its merits according to its own
facts;

each  party  will  act  transparently,  in  particular  each  party  will
disclose all relevant and material facts;

each  party  will  provide  prompt  and  complete  replies  to  any
reasonable queries.

6

Suitability of concluding APA

Single indicators not determinative

18.
While  single  indicators  may  point  in  one  direction  or  the  other,  the
Commissioner will consider each APA request on balance having regard to all the
relevant  facts  and  circumstances.    No  one  indicator  is,  of  itself,  determinative.
However, transparency as to the material facts is essential.

More likely for the Commissioner to enter into an APA

The Commissioner may be more likely to enter into an APA where one

19.
or more of the indicators set out below are present:

(a)

(b)

(c)

the transfer pricing methodology adopted under the proposed APA
best achieves consistency with the Transfer Pricing Guidelines for
(TPG)
Multinational  Enterprises  and  Tax  Administrations
published  by  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and
Development (OECD) on 10 July 2017;

the  controlled  transactions  covered  by  the  proposed  APA  have
already been entered into and are unlikely to change significantly
in the period of the APA;

a  proposed  arrangement  is  under  serious  contemplation  and  the
proposed actual provisions are unlikely to change significantly in
the period of the APA;

(d)

the transfer pricing issues are complex and there is uncertainty as
to how the transfer pricing rules apply;

(e)  without an APA, the probability of double taxation is high.

Less likely for the Commissioner to enter into an APA

The Commissioner may be less likely to enter into an APA where one or

20.
more of the indicators set out below are present:

(a)

the  actual  provisions  are  simple  or  routine  with  arm’s  length

7

provisions being relatively certain without any significant transfer
pricing risk;

the  controlled  transactions  to  be  covered  by  the  APA  are  only  a
small portion in terms of value of the total controlled transactions;

the  proposed  APA  would  not  ensure  that  there  is  alignment
between true economic activity and profit outcomes in Hong Kong;

the  collateral  issues  would  affect  the  Commissioner’s  ability  to
enter into the APA;

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

the proposed APA application would result in double non-taxation;

(f)

the arrangements that are the subject of the proposed APA appear
to lack commerciality or be primarily tax driven (e.g. the proposed
APA  covers  activities  which  involve  structures,  restructuring  or
greenfields  arrangements  where  the  commercial  benefits  to  the
operations of the MNE in Hong Kong are questionable).

Exemption from preparing the master file and local file does not preclude
21.
the  Commissioner  and  the  person  from  entering  into  an  APA.    However,  in
instances where a person is not required under section 58C of the IRO to prepare
such transfer pricing documentation, the Commissioner considers that the person
may be less likely to request an APA.

Losses carried forward

Where carried forward losses are available to a person, the Commissioner
22.
will treat this aspect as a collateral issue and understand the reasons behind those
losses being incurred.   Presence of losses carried forward from back years, however,
will not prevent the Commissioner from entering into an APA.

Presence of tax avoidance issues

23.
In determining the arm’s length outcomes, the consideration required is
more than just pricing.  This can include consideration of the global value chain,
structures,  functions,  assets  and  risks,  transfer  pricing  methodologies,  etc.
Consideration of such matters is part of the process of dealing with an APA request
or application.

8

In rare instances, the Commissioner may also need to consider whether
24.
the controlled transactions to be covered by the proposed APA might lead to the
application of:

(a)

the general anti-avoidance provisions in section 61 or 61A of the
IRO; or

(b)

other specific anti-avoidance provisions of the IRO.

Where the possible application of section 61 or 61A or other specific anti-
25.
avoidance provisions of the IRO may arise in relation to the controlled transactions
to be covered by the proposed APA, the Commissioner will consider the transfer
pricing  issues  arising  as  part  of  the  APA  request  or  application  and  the
aforementioned  matters  concurrently.    In  such  instances,  this  may  result  in  the
Commissioner making further enquiries in the early engagement stage.

Analysis  of  the  transfer  pricing  issues  in  tandem  with  potential  tax
26.
avoidance issues can assist in the resolution of those issues.  The Commissioner
will use the most appropriate strategy and intervene as early as possible to resolve
such tax avoidance issues and thereby reduce the possibility for dispute.

Consistent with the above approach, the Commissioner will also resolve
27.
such  tax  avoidance  issues  in  parallel  with  progression  of  the  proposed  APA  in
instances where the general anti-avoidance provisions in section 61 or 61A or other
specific anti-avoidance provisions may apply to transactions other than those to be
covered by the proposed APA.

The  Commissioner  will  discuss  the  resolution  of  such  tax  avoidance

28.
issues with the person and factor it into the development of agreed case plans.

THE APA PROCESS

Three stages of the APA process

29.
The APA process, which is explained in this Practice Note, has replaced
the  former  process.    The  APA  process,  after  revision,  reflects:  a  principle-based
approach;  a  more  streamlined  process;  and  revamped  procedures  to  improve
timeliness.  The revised APA process has been reduced to three stages and the key

9

changes are:

(a)

(b)

(c)

delivery of a more balanced approach to understand the totality of
the controlled transactions;

deliberate early engagement stage with a more rigorous approach
if necessary;

greater  focus  on  identifying  and  appropriately  considering
collateral issues.

30.

The revised APA process has three stages:

Stage 1:  Early engagement
Stage 2:  APA application
Stage 3:  Monitoring and compliance

31.
An APA request enters an early engagement stage before progressing to
an APA application.  Once the APA application is received, it passes to the APA
application  stage.    After  an  APA  has  been  made,  there  is  a  further  stage  of
monitoring and compliance.

The APA process is not necessarily a linear one.  In particular instances,
32.
some  steps  or  combinations  of  steps  may  need  to  be  repeated.    For  example,  if
insufficient information is provided to support the APA request, the Commissioner
may need to develop a greater understanding of the controlled transactions or the
application of the proposed methodology.

Timeframe for concluding an APA

The tentative timeframe is: 6 months for the early engagement stage; and
33.
18 months for the APA application stage.  For bilateral or multilateral APAs, the
timeframe  would  also  depend  on  the  progress  of  negotiation  with  the  competent
authorities  of  the  relevant  DTA  territories.    Generally,  a  longer  timeframe  is
required in more complex cases.

Thresholds

34.

APA  is  most  suitable  for  complex  controlled  transactions  with  high

10

transfer  pricing  risk  (e.g.  few  comparables  found;  significant  amount  of  tax
involved  and  significant  profits  shifted  out  of  Hong  Kong).      To  better  utilise
resources of the Commissioner and stakeholders, it is therefore necessary to set a
threshold for APA applications.

The thresholds2 for an APA application, which is subject to review by the

35.
Commissioner from time to time, are as follows:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

sales or purchases of $80 million per annum if the APA application
relates to the sale or purchase of goods;

service  fees  of  $40  million  per  annum  if  the  APA  application
relates to the provision of services;

royalties of $20 million per annum if the APA application relates
to the use of intangible properties;

business profits of $20 million per annum if the APA application
relates to the attribution of profit to a permanent establishment in
Hong Kong; or

(e)

amount of $20 million per annum if the APA application relates to
transactions not falling within subparagraphs (a) to (d) above.

The thresholds refer to the expected amounts of transactions and these thresholds
will apply to new and renewal applications.

While  the  thresholds  are  operated  consistently,  the  Commissioner  after
36.
taking  into  account  the  number  and  relative  size  of  the  transactions,  the  transfer
pricing risk and the likely attitude of the DTA territories, may relax the eligibility
criteria to allow a person access to the APA process.

Communicating with other competent authorities

Early communication with other competent authorities

For bilateral or multilateral APA, when making the APA request, a person
37.
should  ensure  that  the  person  and  associated  persons  meet  the  APA  application

2 Thresholds are in Hong Kong currency.

11

requirements  of  the  relevant  DTA  territories.    It  may  also  be  useful  for  the
Commissioner and the related competent authorities to have an early exchange of
views on whether a bilateral or multilateral APA would be appropriate.  This could
avoid unnecessary work if it is unlikely that one of the competent authorities will
participate.  These discussions may be of an informal nature and do not necessarily
require  a  formal  face-to-face  meeting.    The  competent  authority  of  each  DTA
territory  will  undertake  its  own  evaluation  and  analysis  of  the  case  from  its
perspective  and  may  contribute  information  or  insights  not  known  to  the
Commissioner,  or  take  different  positions  in  relation  to  the  appropriate  transfer
pricing methodology.

Other competent authorities kept informed about the process

38.

Where a bilateral or multilateral APA is being sought, the Commissioner will:

(a)

(b)

expect  the  person  to  continue  to  make  the  relevant  information
available at the same time to the DTA territory involved, such that
the DTA territory will be kept informed about the progress of its
examination of the APA application; and

seek  to  discuss  with  the  DTA  territory  key  issues  arising  at  the
earliest opportunity and will keep the person informed about the
progress of the bilateral process.

The person should also relay to the Commissioner feedback and views, if any, from
the competent authority of the DTA territory in relation to the APA.

STAGE 1: EARLY ENGAGEMENT

Request for APA early engagement

Model request

39.
A person can request for an APA by submitting a request for APA early
engagement (APA request)3.  Content of model APA request is given in Appendix 1.
In view of the technicalities involved in the APA process, it is in the interest of the

3  If an APA request is made on an anonymous basis with reasons, sufficient information about the operations

must nonetheless be provided to make any discussion meaningful.

12

person making the APA request to consider seeking professional advice throughout
the APA process.

Type of APA requested

The person should decide which type of APA (i.e. unilateral, bilateral or
40.
multilateral) should be applied for.  In general, the Commissioner expects that the
proposed APA is bilateral or multilateral rather than unilateral except where:

(a)

(b)

(c)

the person or associated persons are resident in a jurisdiction with
which Hong Kong has no DTA;

the relevant DTA territory has no APA process or will not process
the bilateral or multilateral APA application;

the  bilateral  or  multilateral  APA  sought  is  not  technically
meaningful and cost-effective from Hong Kong’s perspective (e.g.
Hong Kong is at the hub of arrangements with associated persons
in many different jurisdictions and the trade flows involved with
any one particular jurisdiction are relatively modest in scale); or

(d)  most of the transfer pricing risk lies in Hong Kong.

Scope of request

An APA request should describe the specific transfer pricing issues for
41.
which  certainty  is  sought  in  relation  to  the  controlled  transactions  and  collateral
issues if any.  Clear and adequate supporting documentation should be attached to
the  APA  request  to  outline  the  scope  of  the  proposed  APA,  including  the
methodology to be used and the way how the collateral issues can be resolved.

Draft APA case plan

When submitting the APA request, the person should also provide a draft
42.
APA case plan which contains a structured timeline.   A model APA case plan is
given in Appendix 2.

13

Deadline for submitting request

An APA request together with a draft APA case plan should be made, at
43.
least 6 months prior to the proposed commencement date for the APA requested, in
writing to:

Chief Assessor (Tax Treaty)
Tax Treaty Section
Inland Revenue Department
GPO Box 10851, Hong Kong

Setting up the APA team

44.
Upon receipt of the APA request, an APA team will be formed within the
Department to process the APA request.  The person making the APA request will be
informed of the name and contact number of the APA team leader as soon as possible.

45.

In the early engagement stage, the APA team will:

(a)

explain the APA process;

(b)

provide feedback on the APA request;

(c)

(d)

evaluate  whether  the  person  making  the  APA  request  should  be
invited to apply formally for an APA; and

develop agreed plans with the person, one for the APA request to
proceed  through  the  early  engagement  stage,  and  the  other  to
conclude the APA itself.

Developing a tailored solution

46.
This stage involves initially a robust and holistic strategic level review of
the APA request and supporting documentation, including an examination of the
relevant global value chain.  In later steps of this stage, the APA team and the person
making the APA request will discuss the proposed APA in more detail.  Throughout
this stage and as part of planning for later steps and stages, the APA team will seek
to develop a tailored solution that meets the needs of the person making the APA
request.

14

Preliminary discussions

Preliminary discussions are held with the person making the APA request
47.
as  part  of  the  cooperative  relationship  to  explore  avenues  for  the  appropriate
treatment  of  the  covered  controlled  transactions  and  any  collateral  issues.    The
Commissioner and the person will then know what to expect if and when the person
lodges an APA application.

Openly  discussing  the  APA  request  should  stimulate  a  free  flow  of
48.
information  and  lead  to  a  more  robust  review  of  the  request  and  any  supporting
documentation.    Such  discussions  should  better  facilitate  submission  of  an  APA
application and subsequent agreement to a workable and practical APA.

49.

During preliminary discussions, the APA team should:

(a)

confirm the scope of the proposed APA;

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

(g)

classify the proposed APA (unilateral, bilateral or multilateral) and
identify the appropriate timeline for the APA process;

ensure  appropriate  stakeholders  within  the  Department  are
involved  in  the  APA  process  providing  the  necessary  technical
assistance and support;

review and confirm the worldwide structure of the group and the
role of the person making the APA request within the global value
chain relating to the controlled transactions;

identify  the  preferred  transfer  pricing  method,  methods  or
combination thereof;

identify and confirm any collateral issues and agree with the person
on the approach to resolve those issues;

consider whether the person may need to address the exceptions to
the general rule of recognising the transaction or arrangement as
to
actually  undertaken  and  structured
Departmental  Interpretation  and  Practice  Notes  No.  59  Transfer
Pricing between Associated Persons).  If the APA team considers

(see  Appendix  1

15

that it is possible that such exceptions might apply, the APA team
needs to  discuss with the person whether this aspect needs to be
addressed in the APA application;

(h)

agree  with  the  person  or  the  person’s  representatives  an  early
engagement case plan up to lodgment of the APA application;

(i)

(j)

agree  with  the  person  a  draft  plan  for  concluding  the  APA  after
lodgment of the APA application; and

in a bilateral or multilateral APA, keep the person informed to the
best  extent  possible  of  discussions  held  with  the  competent
authorities of the relevant DTA territories.

After the scope of the proposed APA has been agreed, changes to it will
50.
not  be  made  other  than  in  exceptional  circumstances,  which  may  include  one  or
more of the following:

(a)

changes to the covered controlled transactions;

(b)

identification of a new issue with significant tax risk;

(c)

(d)

the need to interpret how the transfer pricing provisions apply to
new controlled transactions;

new issue raised by the competent authority of the relevant DTA
territory.

51.
If  the  person  making  the  APA  request  intends  to  make  changes  to  the
scope of the proposed APA, the Commissioner has to be consulted.  The case plan
will then be updated to reflect such changes.

52.
Preliminary discussions do not bind the person making the APA request
and the Commissioner to the APA  process.     Having such a discussion does not
mean the person has been accepted into the APA application stage.

Generally,  preliminary  discussions  should  commence  at  least  5  months
53.
prior  to  the  anticipated  commencement  date  for  the  APA  (e.g.  for  an  APA
commencing from 1 January 2021, the APA request should be submitted no later

16

than 30 June 2020 while the first preliminary discussions should be held no later
than 31 July 2020).  For a bilateral or multilateral APA, any specific requirements
of the relevant DTA territories should also be taken into account.

Inviting the submission of an APA application

The APA team will consider the information contained in the APA
54.
request, the APA team’s preliminary research and the greater detail provided during
the preliminary discussions, and make recommendations to the Commissioner.

The Commissioner will make a decision on whether the person making
55.
the  APA  request  will  be  invited  to  submit  an  APA  application  based  on  terms
discussed  previously,  and  will  ensure  consistency  of  approach  across  all  APA
requests.

56.
Where  the  Commissioner  agrees,  the  APA  team  leader  will  extend  a
written  invitation  to  the  person  making  the  APA  request  to  lodge  an  APA
application.  Where the Commissioner does not accept the request, the APA team
leader will provide written reasons for that decision.

57.
In determining whether the Commissioner will invite the person to submit
an APA application, the Commissioner should consider the person’s relevant facts
and  circumstances  in  the  context  of  the  global  value  chain  and  other  steps  or
arrangements with which they might be linked.

The  Commissioner  should  also  consider  these  facts  and  circumstances
58.
against all relevant matters, rather than restrict the analysis only to the controlled
transactions that are the subject of the proposed APA.

In addition to the indicators in paragraphs 18 to 20, the Commissioner will

59.
consider whether:

(a)

(b)

the information provided allows for a full and proper consideration
by the Commissioner of the proposed APA;

is  an  explanation  demonstrating

the  controlled
there
transactions  covered  by  the  proposed  APA  are  relevant  and
material to the person’s business;

that

17

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

(g)

(h)

(i)

(j)

the  transfer  pricing  risks  and  issues  arising  from  the  controlled
transactions  warrant  the  allocation  of  resources  required  for  an
APA;

an  APA  is  a  suitable  solution  for  the  person  given  the  risks
involved,  the  person’s  compliance  history  (locally  and  globally)
and the person’s performance under any previous APA;

one of the persons to the controlled transactions or an associated
person  is  likely  to  get  a  tax  advantage  from  the  structures,
transactions or actual provisions that are the subject of the proposed
APA and that tax advantage may be obtained to the detriment of
another person to the transactions;

the  transfer  pricing  method  adopted  under  the  proposed  APA  is
unlikely  to  result  in  the  person  getting  a  tax  advantage  and  the
transfer  pricing  method  best  achieves  consistency  with  the  TPG
published by the OECD on 10 July 2017;

in  the  absence  of  an  APA,  there  is  a  likelihood  that  the  actual
provisions  of  the  controlled  transactions  may  result  in  double
taxation or a dispute;

the  controlled  transactions  covered  by  the  proposed  APA  are
ongoing  in  nature  and  there  is  a  significant  part  of  a  limited  life
project left;

the Commissioner anticipates that the persons will agree all aspects
of the APA in a timely manner; and

collateral issues are capable of being resolved prior to or in parallel
with the conclusion of the APA.

60.
This list is not exhaustive.  No one matter is determinative.  Rather, any
decision  is  to  be  made  on  balance  after  considering  all  relevant  circumstances.
Furthermore, one matter does not necessarily have any greater weighting relative
to another.

18

Such decisions involve the Commissioner using professional judgment in
61.
light  of  the  APA  team’s  analysis  of  these  matters  in  relation  to  facts  and
circumstances of each case.

 Submission of APA application

62.
If  a  person  accepts  the  Commissioner’s  invitation  to  submit  an  APA
application,  the  person  should  submit  to  the  Commissioner  an  APA  application
within  the  timeframe  agreed  at  the  early  engagement  stage.    In  general,  if  the
controlled  transactions  fall  within  section  50AAF,  all  persons  involved  in  the
controlled  transactions  and  chargeable  to  profits  tax  are  expected  to  join  the
application.

63.
While the Commissioner does not intend to prescribe a set format for an
APA application, section 2 of Schedule 17H provides that an APA application must
include:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the  details  of  the  person  lodging  the  APA  application  (i.e.
applicant) and if applicable, the associated persons of the applicant
involved in the controlled transactions in respect of which the APA
is applied for;

the facts and documents relating to the applicant and if applicable,
the associated persons and the controlled transactions;

the proposed methodology for determining the income or loss of
the applicant;

the evidence showing that the proposed methodology can produce
a  result  that  complies  with  sections  50AAF  and  50AAK,  if
applicable;

(e)

the period in respect of which an APA is applied for; and

(f)

a draft APA.

In the case of a bilateral or multilateral APA, the applicant should also
64.
advise the  Commissioner of the information  or documentation requests  made  by
the  tax  administrations  of  the  relevant  DTA  territories  in  relation  to  the  APA

19

application  and  ensure  that  the  Commissioner  will  be  provided  with  a  list  of
information or documentation supplied by the person or associated persons to the
tax administrations of the DTA territories concerned.

65.
All documentation should be clearly labelled, indexed and referenced.  An
English  or  Chinese  translation  should  be  provided  if  the  documents  are  in  a
language other than English or Chinese.

The  applicant  should  provide  all  information  and  documentation  as
66.
agreed  in  the  early  engagement  stage  and  any  other  information  that  may  be  of
assistance in progressing the APA application.  The applicant may discuss with the
APA  team  what  information  and  documentation  is  required.    The  applicant  will
only  be  required  to  provide  information  which  is  material  and  relevant  to  the
analysis and evaluation of the APA application.

67.
Where there are a large number of records or documents in support of the
APA application, the Commissioner may agree that some or all of these need not
be  provided  with  the  APA  application.    Such  records  or  documents  should  be
referenced in the APA application and made available if requested.

In the APA application, the principal officer of the applicant must make

68.
the following statements:

“I  understand  that  my  application  would  not  affect  the  right  of
objection  against  an  assessment  or  right  of  appeal  to  the  courts
under the provisions of the Inland Revenue Ordinance.

I  agree  that  all  documents  and  information  submitted  to  the
Commissioner  for  the  purposes  of  the  APA  application  may  be
provided  to  the  competent  authorities  of  the  relevant  DTA
territories for processing the APA.

I  declare  that  I  have  examined  the  APA  application,  including
accompanying  documents,  and  to  the  best  of  my  knowledge  and
belief,  the  facts  presented  in  support  of  the  application  are  true,
correct and complete.”

Content of model APA application is given in Appendix 3.

20

Under  the  transparency  framework  of  Action  5  under  the  OECD/G20
69.
Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, rulings including cross-border unilateral
APAs are required to be spontaneously exchanged with the relevant jurisdictions.
For this purpose, if a unilateral APA application involves cross-border controlled
transactions,  the  applicant  must  submit  at  the  time  of  application  the  completed
template for spontaneous exchange of information on cross-border unilateral APA
at Appendix 4.

For bilateral or multilateral APA application, the applicant should ensure
70.
that  another  APA  application  is  submitted  to  the  tax  administration  of  the  DTA
territory concerned, and the requirements of the APA process in the DTA territory
concerned are met.

71.
As soon as is administratively practicable, but no later than 1 month after
receipt  and  acceptance  of  a  bilateral  or  multilateral  APA  application,  the
Commissioner will notify the competent authority of each relevant DTA territory.
After  the  relevant  competent  authority  or  authorities  agreed  to  participate  in  the
APA process, a timetable will be set for the APA.  The APA team will then finalise
and execute the APA case plan.

Payment of deposit

An applicant may be required under section 7(2) of Schedule 17H to pay
72.
a  deposit  of  an  amount  determined  by  the  Commissioner  before  the  APA
application  is  entertained.    Upon  receipt  of  the  APA  application,  the  APA  team
leader will notify the applicant of the amount of the deposit required.   Processing
of the case will not be started until the required deposit is paid.  The deposit paid
will be used to settle the fees charged for the APA application.

STAGE 2: APA APPLICATION

Steps involved

If an applicant accepts the Commissioner’s invitation to submit an APA

73.
application, the APA application stage commences.  The steps in this stage are:

Analysis and evaluation
The  APA  team  analyses  critically  and  evaluates  the  APA

(a)

21

application,
comparability analysis.

including  any  associated  documentation  and

(b)

Negotiation
The  APA  team  develops  an  APA  document  containing  the
Commissioner’s  position  with  which  the  Commissioner  enters
negotiations.  The terms and conditions of the APA are negotiated
with a view to reaching agreement.

Agreement

(c)  Where agreement is reached, the relevant parties enter into an APA.

Analysis and evaluation

Aim and scope

The APA team will analyse critically and evaluate the APA application

74.
and the information in support with the aim of verifying that:

(a)

(b)

(c)

the  proposed  APA  results  in  an  arm’s  length  outcome  for  the
covered  controlled  transactions,  thereby  mitigating  any  transfer
pricing risk;

there is sufficient information in support of the APA application so
as to allow the Commissioner to fully evaluate it; and

the proposal in the APA application is consistent with the person’s
request and preliminary discussions in the early engagement stage.

The APA team will check the APA application in respect of the matters

75.
listed below:

(a)

controlled transactions to be covered by the APA;

(b)

structures and the allocation of functions within different parts of
the MNE;

(c)

analysis of functions, assets and risks;

22

(d)

resultant characterisation of the controlled transactions;

(e)

transfer pricing methodology proposed;

(f)

comparability analysis;

(g)

arm’s length outcome proposed; and

(h)

critical assumptions proposed.

76.
The APA team will examine the transfer pricing documentation that can
be  expected  to  be  available  for  reviewing,  including  those  referred  to  in
Departmental  Interpretation  and  Practice  Notes  No.  58  Transfer  Pricing
Documentation and Country-by-Country Reports.

If the APA team considers the aims listed in paragraph 74 are satisfied,

77.
further enquiry may not be necessary.

Additional information

78.    When  verifying  whether  the  proposed  APA  results  in  an  arm’s  length
outcome and having regard to the totality of the controlled transactions, the APA
team may need to make further enquiries, such as:

(a)

additional  information  requests  to  the  applicant  and  associated
persons; and

(b)

interviews with key personnel of the applicant or the tested party.

79.    Where the proposal in the APA application is not consistent with details
arising from preliminary discussions, the APA team may request from the applicant
an explanation as to the differences.  Where there is insufficient information for the
APA team to conduct a full evaluation of the APA application, the APA team will
request the information it needs.

Independent experts

80.
The  APA  team  reviews  the  applicant’s  functional  analysis,  comparability
study  and,  where  applicable,  suggested  arm’s  length  range.    In  verifying  that  the

23

outcomes arising from the APA application are consistent with the arm’s length principle,
the APA team may seek assistance from relevant independent expert as necessary.

81.
An  independent  expert  may  be  appointed  by  the  Commissioner  under
section 4 of Schedule 17H to inquire into and report on any matters in relation to
an APA application.  The Commissioner will consult the applicant on the matter
and take into account the academic qualifications, related work experience, etc. of
the  potential  candidates  for  making  the  appointment.    Any  fee  paid  by  the
Commissioner to the independent expert should be reimbursed by the applicant.

82.
The  Commissioner  will  seek  independent  expert’s  advice  only  in
exceptional circumstances (e.g. where complex transfer pricing issues are involved
or a greater understanding of the relevant industry is needed).  The APA team will
discuss this aspect with the applicant in the early engagement or APA application
stages.  As a rule of practice, the independent expert should provide a fee estimate
to enable the applicant to decide whether the APA application should be proceeded
with or not.

83.
The  independent  expert  will  have  access  to  all  relevant  information
provided under the  APA process having regard to confidentiality  and conflict of
interest considerations and will be subject to the secrecy provisions of the IRO.

The

independent  expert’s  advice  would  be  considered  by

the
84.
Commissioner in examining the transfer pricing methodology but will not bind the
Commissioner,  the  applicant  or  the  competent  authority  of  the  DTA  territory,  in
accepting or rejecting the proposed transfer pricing methodology.

The  Commissioner  will  share  the  expert’s  advice  with  the  applicant.
85.
However, its release depends on finalisation of the Commissioner’s position in respect
of the expert’s advice and any confidential third party information in that advice.

Consent with the applicant

If  the  APA  team  does  not  agree  with  the  contentions  in  the  APA
86.
application, the APA team will negotiate with the applicant with a view to reaching
an agreement on the functional analysis, a comparability set and the arm’s length
outcome.  If no agreement is possible, the Commissioner will withdraw from the
negotiations and refuse to make the APA.  In such a case, the APA team will inform
the applicant of the refusal in writing.

24

Negotiation

Terms of APA

87.
The  APA  team  will  prepare  the  APA  terms  in  consultation  with  the
applicant.   For bilateral or multilateral APA, the APA team leader will ensure that
the applicant and the Commissioner have a common understanding of the issues to
be agreed in the APA which will form the basis for negotiations with the competent
authorities of the relevant DTA territories.

Negotiation  is  a  mutual  discussion  and  arrangement  of  the  terms  of  a
88.
transaction or agreement.  In the context of an APA, negotiation refers to mutual
discussions and an arrangement in respect of the transfer pricing of the controlled
transactions to be covered by the APA.

In  negotiating  the  terms  of  the  APA,  the  Commissioner  will  apply  the

89.
skills and attributes of an effective negotiator.

In negotiating an APA with each of the relevant parties, the APA team
90.
needs to have regard to the totality of the arrangements among the applicant and the
associated persons and the APA being:

(a)

(b)

one  method  by  which  the  perceived  transfer  pricing  risk  can  be
managed and mitigated; and

an inherently commercial and practical outcome for the applicant
to which the Commissioner will commit.

Negotiating with other competent authority

In  the  case  of  a  bilateral  or  multilateral  APA,  the  Commissioner,  in
91.
consultation with the APA team, will negotiate with the competent authorities of
the  relevant  DTA  territories.    Although  the  applicant  is  not  a  party  to  these
negotiations, in limited circumstances, the applicant may be requested to make a
presentation  on  factual  matters  where  clarification  of  the  actual  fact  pattern  will
enhance  the  level  of  understanding  of  the  Commissioner  and  the  competent
authorities concerned.

25

Any exchange of information between the competent authorities during
92.
the course of their negotiations is conducted in accordance with the Exchange of
Information  Article  of  the  relevant  DTA.    Exchanges  between  competent
authorities of position papers in the course of negotiations are considered to be part
of government-to-government business.  Although the APA team will explain the
Commissioner’s  position  to  the  applicant,  the  position  papers  of  the  competent
authorities of the relevant DTA territories will not be supplied to the applicant.

In the case of a unilateral APA, the APA team leader will negotiate with

93.
the applicant, endeavouring to reach agreement on the terms of the APA.

Absence of agreement

94.
If,  after  using  best  endeavours,  the  Commissioner  and  the  competent
authorities of the relevant DTA territories cannot reach agreement on the terms of
a bilateral or multilateral APA in a reasonable timeframe, the Commissioner may
decide to withdraw from the negotiations and consider concluding a unilateral APA
with the applicant.

Similarly, if after using their best endeavours, the APA team leader and
95.
the  applicant  cannot  reach  agreement  on  the  terms  of  a  unilateral  APA,  the
Commissioner may decide to withdraw from the negotiations and refuse to make
the APA.  In such a case, the APA team will inform the applicant of the refusal in
writing.

Agreement

Matters specified in an APA

96.

Section 50AAP(2) provides that an APA with an applicant must specify:

(a)

the name of the applicant to which the APA applies;

(b)

the controlled transactions covered by the APA, if applicable;

(c)

the period covered by the APA;

(d)

the  methodology  as  agreed  between  the  Commissioner  and  the
applicant for determining the income or loss of the applicant;

26

(e)

the critical assumptions on which the agreed methodology is based;

(f)

the  applicant’s  obligations  under  the  APA,  including  obligations
for  providing  reports  on  the  matters,  and  at  the  intervals,  as
specified in the APA; and

(g)

any  other  terms  as  agreed  between  the  Commissioner  and  the
applicant.

APA under section 50AAP(1)

For a unilateral APA, the form of the APA will normally be a document
97.
setting out the terms of the arrangement which is signed by the applicant and the
Commissioner.  For a bilateral or multilateral APA, when a mutual agreement is
reached by the competent authorities, the applicant will be given the opportunity to
accept  or  reject  that  mutual  agreement.    Where  the  applicant  accepts  the  mutual
agreement between the competent authorities, the Commissioner and the applicant
will enter into the APA.  The form of this APA could include:

(a)

(b)

(c)

a written agreement, based on the terms of the mutual agreement
between the competent authorities, signed by the applicant and the
Commissioner;

a signed statement that the applicant will abide by the terms of the
mutual agreement between the competent authorities; or

some  other  documentation  demonstrating  the  consent  of  the
applicant to abide by the terms of the mutual agreement between
the competent authorities.

A model APA under section 50AAP(1) with the applicant is given in Appendix 5.

98.
The  APA  team  leader  will  provide  the  applicant  with  the  APA  and
demand note for the final fees payable.  The applicant is required to pay the final
fees required and return the signed APA to the APA team leader.

If  the  applicant  rejects  the  mutual  agreement  between  competent
99.
authorities, then the bilateral or multilateral APA will not proceed and the applicant
may wish to discuss with the APA team about other options available.

27

Normally  the  person  responsible  for  signing  the  APA  under  section
100.
50AAP(1) on behalf of the applicant would be an individual responsible for signing
the profits tax return, subject to that person having authority to commit the applicant
or each of the applicants, if there is more than one applicant, to the terms of the
APA.   The APA team leader will sign the APA under section 50AAP(1) on behalf
of the Commissioner.

Critical assumptions

101.    An  APA  will  define  in  advance  any  factors  or  assumptions  that  are  so
significant  that  neither  party  to  an  arm’s  length  situation  would  continue  to  be
bound  by  the  APA  if  any  of  these  factors  or  assumptions  changed.    A  critical
assumption can be a fact about the applicant, an associated person, a third party, an
industry or general economic conditions that, if changed, would significantly affect
the appropriateness of the substantive terms of the APA.

The APA team determines the suitability of a particular transfer pricing

102.
method and its application on the basis of the facts, including projected facts.

If the APA team considers that any changes in particular circumstances
103.
would  materially  affect  the  suitability  of  the  transfer  pricing  method  or  its
application  under  the  APA,  the  APA  team  must  include  in  the  APA  these
circumstances as “critical assumptions”.  Critical assumptions should be included
in the APA though not within the control  of the applicant or the  Commissioner.
This  may  include  the  APA  team  using  a  range  of  “net  profit  indicators”  to  test
whether or not the level of profit implied by the application of the person’s transfer
pricing method results in outcomes that are replicated by outcomes observed in the
open market.  In formulating or reviewing proposed critical assumptions, the APA
team needs to have regard to the areas within the global group that contribute to its
profit, including the profit forecasts over the period covered by the APA.

104.
Any  set  of  critical  assumptions  needs  to  be  tailored  to  the  individual
circumstances  of  the  applicant,  the  particular  commercial  environment,  the
methodology, and the type of controlled transactions covered.

105.
Critical  assumptions  will  vary  depending  on  the  APA  itself  but  it  is
possible that assumptions will need to be made about some of the following areas:

(a)

assumptions about the relevant domestic tax law and treaty provisions;

28

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

(g)

assumptions  about
government regulations;

tariffs,  duties,

import

restrictions  and

assumptions  about  economic  conditions,  market  share,  market
conditions, end-selling price, and sales volume;

assumptions  about  the  nature  of  the  functions  and  risks  of  the
enterprises involved in the transactions;

assumptions about exchange rates, interest rates, credit rating and
capital structure;

assumptions  about  management  or  financial  accounting  and
classification of income and expenses; and

assumptions  about  the  applicant  or  associated  persons  that  will
operate in each jurisdiction and the form in which they will do so.

Compensating adjustments

106.
The APA needs to contain terms requiring a compensating adjustment to
account for instances where the tested party’s actual result falls outside the agreed
arm’s  length  outcome  as  to  price,  range  or  result,  but  is  within  the  critical
assumption  boundaries.    These  compensating  adjustments  are  made  to  the  tax
position to achieve a price, point in the range or result that reflects the agreed arm’s
length outcomes.

107.    Where necessary in the negotiation step, the APA team will discuss with
the  applicant  how  a  compensating  adjustment  is  to  be  effected  and  the  tax
consequences of that adjustment.

Collateral issues

Defining collateral issues

108.    A collateral issue is:

(a)

an  administrative  or  tax  issue  in  relation  to  the  affairs  of  the
applicant;

29

(b)

in addition to the controlled transactions covered by the APA; and

(c)

relevant to, and can potentially affect, the outcomes of the APA.

109.

Examples of collateral issues include but are not limited to the following:

(a)  whether a permanent establishment exists for the purposes of profit
attribution, or whether the covered controlled transactions involve
a permanent establishment;

(b)  whether  the  nature  of  income  is  royalty  or  business  profit  in  the

context of a particular DTA;

(c)  whether the profits of an overseas associated person are chargeable

to tax under the IRO;

(d)  whether the covered controlled transactions constitute, include or

relate to transactions under section 61 or 61A;

(e)

any legal issues that the Commissioner has not taken a position.

Resolution of collateral issues

The existence of collateral issues and the possible applicability of anti-
110.
avoidance rules may make it inappropriate for the Commissioner to proceed with
an APA.

111.    Where  possible,  collateral  issues  should  be  addressed  and  resolved  in
parallel with the development of the APA.  The APA team should attempt to ensure
that any collateral issues are resolved on or before the Commissioner enters into the
APA.  If this is not possible, then the APA team must ensure that the issue is being
dealt with appropriately.

The applicant and the APA team will need to discuss at the preliminary
112.
discussion step how collateral issues are to be addressed.  Options for the APA team
in getting collateral issues addressed may include recommending that an application
for an advance ruling under section 88A of the IRO be lodged by the person.

30

113.    Where  an  applicant  for  an  APA  also  applies  for  an  advance  ruling  in
relation to a collateral issue, the APA team has to ensure that the applicant is aware
of any implications of the outcomes of the advance ruling may have on the APA.

Fees payable for APA

Scope of charge

The applicant is required under section 7(9) of Schedule 17H to pay fees

114.
in respect of an APA application.  The fees payable include:

(a)

service charge which is calculated on the basis of hours spent by
the officers of the Department and must not exceed $500,000; and

(b)

payment or reimbursement of:

(i)

the fees paid by the Commissioner to an independent expert;
and

(ii)

the  costs  and  expenses  incurred  by  the  Commissioner  in
relation to the APA application.

Section 7(7) of Schedule 17H provides that any fees due and payable in respect of
an APA application are recoverable as a civil debt due to the Government.

Waiver or refund

115.

In exceptional circumstances, the Commissioner may:

(a)   waive  all  or  part  of  any  fees  payable  in  respect  of  an  APA

application; or

(b)

refund to the applicant all or part of any fees paid in respect of an
APA application if the Commissioner does not make an APA.

Fees remain payable upon refusal or withdrawal

116.
Fees are payable though an application is refused or withdrawn.   If an
APA application is withdrawn, the applicant is liable to pay all the fees incurred in

31

respect of the application before the Commissioner receives notice of withdrawal.
However, the Commissioner may waive all or part of any fees payable or refund all
or part of any fees paid in respect of an APA application at his discretion.   The
discretion to waive, wholly or partly, such fees will only be exercised if the APA
cannot be made because of some unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of
the Commissioner and the applicant.

Fees charged by overseas tax administration

The  applicant  and  any  associated  persons  need  to  be  aware  that  some

117.
overseas tax administrations may also charge a fee on an APA application.

STAGE 3: MONITORING AND COMPLIANCE

Disclosure of APA

118.
Section 50AAQ(2) provides that a person with whom the Commissioner
has made an APA must disclose in the profits tax return for the relevant  year of
assessment:

(a)

the existence of the APA;

(b)  whether or not the person has relied on the APA in preparing and

providing the return; and

(c)

any material change to the facts and circumstances specified in the
APA.

119.
If  the  person  has  disclosed  in  the  profits  tax  return  for  the  year  of
assessment that the person has relied on the APA in preparing and providing such
return, and the APA has not been revoked, cancelled or revised, the Commissioner
is to apply sections 50AAF and 50AAK in relation to the person in accordance with
the APA for the year of assessment.

Annual compliance report

120.
A person with an APA concluded will be required under the terms of the
APA  to  prepare  and  submit  an  annual  compliance  report  (ACR)  signed  by  the

32

principal officer of the person for each year of assessment covered by the APA.  As
required under the APA concluded, the person has to submit the ACR at the time
when  submitting  the  profits  tax  return.    The  ACR  has  to  contain  sufficient
information  to  detail  the  actual  results  for  the  relevant  year  and  to  demonstrate
compliance with the terms of the APA.  This level of documentation should provide
cost savings to the persons with an APA concluded.

The ACR is distinct from the person’s obligation to submit a profits tax

121.
return under section 51(1) of the IRO.  The ACR should include:

(a)

(b)

(c)

an  analysis  of  the  compliance  with  the  APA  including  the
information  and  calculations  demonstrating  the  outcome  of  the
application of arm’s length methodology;

details of any compensating adjustments made and how each was
effected in the profits tax return; and

a statement as to whether there has been a breach of any critical
assumptions.

A model ACR is given in Appendix 6.

The ACR will be reviewed by the Assessor handling the profits tax return.

122.
This review includes:

(a)

checking whether any of the critical assumptions listed in the APA
have been breached, and

(b)

confirming that the terms of the APA have been met.

123.  Where  one  or  more  critical  assumptions  or  terms  of  a  bilateral  or
multilateral APA have been breached, the Commissioner will inform the competent
authorities of the relevant DTA territories of such breach.  The Commissioner and
the competent authorities concerned will discuss how to treat the breach under the
MAP Article of the relevant DTA.

124.    Where a critical assumption or a term of a unilateral APA is breached, the
person with the APA concluded will be required to enter into discussions to provide
an explanation.  The Commissioner will then determine how to treat the breach.  In

33

appropriate instances (e.g. where the breach is a material one), the Commissioner
may revoke, revise or cancel the APA.

125.

The Assessor will review the ACR to determine:

(a)  whether the person with the APA made is reporting results below
or at the low end of any ranges specified in the terms of the APA
without  sufficient  evidence  demonstrating  that  external  factors
have caused this to occur; and

(b)  where applicable based on results that are outside any of the agreed
ranges, whether the person has made compensating adjustments so
as to effect a move to the closest point in the relevant ranges.

The compensating adjustments will be examined to verify whether they
126.
achieve a price, point in the range or result that is consistent with the agreed arm’s
length outcomes (e.g. a profit fell outside the agreed arm’s length range under the
transactional net margin method).

The  type  of  results  reported  will  be  checked  to  see  whether  they  are
127.
occurring consistently over the period covered by the APA.  In such instances, the
type of results will be taken into account when dealing with any renewal request on
similar terms.

128.
For bilateral or multilateral APAs, the competent authorities of the DTA
territories concerned may also review the ACR.  If the competent authority of the
relevant DTA territory raises any issue, additional information will be sought from
the person with the APA made.

129.
The  possible  consequences  of  not  complying  with  the  annual  reporting
requirements,  or  failing  to  supply  any  further  information  as  requested  by  the
Commissioner  in  relation  to  an  ACR,  would  be  reflected  in  the  APA  itself  as  a
condition of its continuance.   In addition, the person may be subject to penal actions
provided under section 80(2L)(c) or 82A(1H)(a)(iii).

34

Record keeping

Section  50AAT  provides  that  a  person  in  respect  of  whom  an  APA  is
130.
made for a period must retain, for a period of not less than 7 years after the end of
the APA period, all the records and data:

(a)

relied on in concluding the APA;

(b)

used in applying for the APA; and

(c)

referred  to  in  any  reports,  including  the  ACR,  and  other
information provided to the Commissioner under the APA.

131.
Any  records  requested  by  the  Commissioner  for  the  purpose  of
monitoring  the  APA  should  be  made  available  to  the  Commissioner  within  a
reasonable time.

132.

The Commissioner will consider revoking or cancelling the APA if:

(a)

the record keeping requirements have not been followed;

(b)

(c)

the records do not enable the Commissioner to readily confirm that
the critical assumptions have been met; or

the person in respect of whom an APA is made fails to provide the
records requested within a reasonable time.

Breach of critical assumptions

133.
Section 50AAS provides that a person in respect of whom an APA is made
must  notify  the  Commissioner  of  a  breach  of  any  critical  assumption  within  a
reasonable time after the breach.  As required in the APA concluded, the person has
to notify the Commissioner of any breach of any critical assumptions as soon as
possible, and in any event not later than 1 month after the breach occurs.

134.
The Commissioner will clarify with the person why the breach occurred
and, if needed, all parties including the competent authorities of the relevant DTA
territories in a bilateral or multilateral APA will enter into discussions to revoke,
cancel or revise the APA.  Any supporting documentation and any proposed course

35

of action the person may suggest (e.g. revision of the APA) should be lodged as
early as possible.

135.  When  looking  at  a  change  in  circumstances,  including  general  or
economic  downturn,  the  Commissioner  would  assess  whether  unrelated  third
parties could reasonably have been expected to foresee or anticipate that change in
circumstances at the time the APA was entered into.  If so, the Commissioner would
consider whether the agreed transfer pricing methodology sufficiently took this into
account.  The Commissioner would apply the arm’s length principle to determine
whether any change in critical assumptions is such that unrelated third parties would
have renegotiated the arrangement due to the change in circumstances.

136.
If the APA is revised, the effective date of the revised APA will be stated
in  the  revised  APA.    The  revised  APA  should  also  note  the  date  on  which  the
original APA became no longer effective.

If a revised APA cannot be negotiated, the APA will be cancelled.  Unless
137.
otherwise agreed, the APA will be cancelled as from the date the critical assumption
was breached.  If a transactional profit method is the primary methodology that has
been used in the APA, the APA will generally be cancelled with effect from the
beginning  of  the  basis  period  for  the  year  of  assessment  in  which  the  critical
assumption was breached.  In such circumstances, the methodology will not apply
to the transactions that occurred throughout the whole of the basis period.

Revocation, cancellation or revision

Power to revoke, cancel or revise

138.    Despite  the  co-operative  environment  built  on  mutual  trust  being  an
essential part of the APA process, the person making the APA request may in rare
instances make an incorrect statement, provide incorrect information, omit to make
a statement, or omit to provide information.

139.    Where the Commissioner has reason to believe that the person has made
an incorrect statement, provided incorrect information, omitted to make a statement
or omitted to provide information, and the statement or information that is incorrect
or omitted is material to the APA application, the Commissioner will review the
APA, though concluded, with a view to determining whether the APA should be
revoked, cancelled or revised.

36

Section 50AAR(1) provides that the Commissioner may revoke, cancel or

140.
revise an APA made if:

(a)

(b)

any condition or critical assumption specified in the APA has not
been met or is no longer met;

the person has failed to comply with the person’s obligations under
the APA (e.g. failure to submit the ACR or keep records and data);
or

(c)

in connection with the APA application, the person is found to have:

(i)

made an incorrect statement; or

(ii)

provided incorrect information; or

(iii)

omitted to make a statement or provide information,

and  the  statement  or  information  is  material  to  the  APA
application.

Consequence of revocation, cancellation or revision

141.
If  the  Commissioner  revokes  an  APA,  section  50AAR(2)  provides  that
the APA is to be treated as having never been made.   If the Commissioner cancels
an APA, section 50AAR(3) provides that the APA is to cease to apply from a date
that the Commissioner determines.   If the Commissioner revises an APA, section
50AAR(4)  provides  that  the  revision  is  to  take  effect  from  a  date  that  the
Commissioner determines.

Section 50AAR(5) provides that any revocation, cancellation or revision
142.
of  an  APA  does  not  affect  any  criminal  liability  that  may  arise  in  respect  of  the
matter.    In  practice,  the  Commissioner  would  also  take  appropriate  actions,
including  additional  assessments  and  penal  actions,  after  taking  into  account  the
following factors:

(a)  whether  the  incorrect  statement  is  made  or  the  incorrect
information is provided carelessly, recklessly or willfully, or due
to an honest mistake; or

37

(b)  whether the statement or the information is deliberately omitted or

due to an honest mistake.

143.  When  considering  revoking,  cancelling  or  revising  a  bilateral  or
multilateral APA, the Commissioner will also consult the competent authority of
each of the relevant DTA territories involved.

Renewal

144.
If a person having an APA concluded wishes to request a renewal of the
APA, it must submit the request at least 6 months before the expiration of the APA
to allow time for negotiation and conclusion.  Generally, the renewal of an APA will
follow the same procedure as the original APA request.  In certain circumstances,
however, it would be expected that the time taken to complete the renewal of an
APA would be significantly less than that for concluding the existing APA.

For  timeframes  to  be  reduced,  the  person  would  have  to  provide  any

145.
relevant information requested and demonstrate that:

(a)

the person complied with the terms of the existing APA;

(b)

(c)

(d)

the covered transactions are consistent  with  those in the existing
APA;

there are no material changes to functions, assets or risks for the
person or other persons to the covered transactions;

the transfer pricing methodology used in the existing APA remains
the most appropriate; and

(e)

the critical assumptions in the existing APA are still appropriate.

146.
The  Commissioner  may  require  new  or  updated  economic  studies  and
supporting  documentation.    This  decision  will  be  made  at  the  early  engagement
stage.

147.  Where  a  renewal  involves  substantial  changes  to  the  terms  used  in  the
existing APA, then the renewal process will probably have a similar timeframe to
an original APA process.

38

148.    While an APA renewal request goes through the same stages and steps
outlined above for the initial request, the APA team will:

(a)

seek the consent of all parties to the renewal of the APA; and

(b)  where  appropriate  and  as  much  as  possible  having  regard  to  the
totality  of  the  controlled  transactions  between  the  entities,
streamline  the  process  so  as  to  reduce  the  time  involved  and
documentation required for dealing with the request.

The  circumstances  where  it  may  be  appropriate  for  the  APA  team  to

149.
streamline an APA renewal process include:

(a)

there have been no material changes to the controlled transactions
or the role of the Hong Kong entities within the global value chain;

(b)

there are no proposed changes to the terms of the APA; and

(c)

it is unlikely that there will be material changes to the controlled
transactions over the course of the period of the renewed APA.

In  a  streamlined  process,  generally  the  APA  team  would  only  need  to

150.
assure itself that:

(a)

entering into an APA with the person making the renewal request
is still appropriate, including the proposed APA producing arm’s
length outcomes;

(b)

the existing APA produced arm’s length outcomes;

(c)

there  have  been  no  material  changes  to  the  covered  controlled
transactions;

(d)

the updated benchmarks are appropriate; and

(e)

the  person  has  complied  with  the  terms  of  the  existing  APA,  as
evidenced by the Commissioner’s review of the ACRs lodged.

39

The  information  required  for  the  streamlined  process  is  likely  to  be
151.
significantly  less  than  that  required  where  an  APA  renewal  involves  material
changes to the terms of the existing APA.

REFUSAL AND WITHDRAWAL

Refusal

Section 50AAP(3)(a) provides that the Commissioner may refuse to make

152.
an APA if:

(a)

the APA is to apply to any provision made or imposed as between
any persons any of whom has income or loss to be computed for the
purposes of Hong Kong tax; but the specified person, who is not an
applicant for the APA, fails or refuses to join in the application; or

(b)

any fee payable under Schedule 17H for the APA application, or
any deposit for the fee payable under that Schedule, is not paid.

153.
Section 50AAP(3) does not limit the grounds on which the Commissioner
may refuse to make an APA.  If the Commissioner refuses to make an APA, section
6 of Schedule 17H requires the Commissioner to give the applicant a written notice
stating the decision and the reasons for the refusal.

Withdrawal

Section 5 of Schedule 17H provides that the applicant may withdraw an
154.
APA  application  by  written  notice  to  the  Commissioner.    However,  withdrawal
from the APA process, especially at a late stage and without good cause, should be
discouraged because of the inevitable waste of resources caused by such action.

PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF APA AND ROLLBACK

Duration of APA

155.
In general, an APA will have prospective application only with a specific
duration of 3 to 5 years.  The commencement date for an APA will be discussed

40

with the applicant and for a bilateral or multilateral APA, the competent authorities
of the relevant DTA territories, and will be specified in the APA.

156.
The  commencement  date  for  an  APA  is  likely  to  be  affected  by
considerations  of  rollback  of  transfer  pricing  methodology  or  prior  year
examination.    It  may  commence  from  the  beginning  of  the  year  in  which  APA
negotiations  are  finalised.    Any  specific  requirements  of  the  relevant  DTA
territories should also be taken into account.

157.
If the finalisation of an APA application is not delayed substantially, the
Commissioner may make an APA under section 50AAP(5) for a period that covers
a period earlier than the date of the APA but:

(a)

(b)

liability for tax is not to be increased after the expiry of the time
limit for making an assessment or additional assessment under the
IRO; and

liability for tax is not to be reduced after the expiry of the latest of
the  time  limits  for  raising  an  objection  or  applying  for  relief  or
revision of assessment as applicable under the IRO or any relevant
DTA.

If  the  finalisation  of  an  APA  application  is  delayed  substantially  and
158.
beyond the commencement date requested by the applicant, the Commissioner will
normally  seek  to  specify  a  later  commencement  date  for  the  APA  in  order  to
preserve the prospective nature of the APA.  The Commissioner will also seek to
preserve the prospective 3 to 5 years duration of an APA.

159.  Where  a  later  commencement  date  is  specified  for  the  APA,  the
Commissioner  will  consider  seeking  to  rollback  the  methodology  agreed  in  the
APA into the prior years intended to be covered in the original application and/or
extend  the  period  of  the  APA.    Any  specific  requirements  of  the  relevant  DTA
territories should also be taken into account.

Rollback

Section  50AAQ(4)  provides  that  the  Commissioner  may,  if  the
160.
Commissioner considers appropriate, apply the principles developed in an APA to
a period earlier than the date of the APA but:

41

(a)

(b)

liability for tax is not to be increased under this subsection after the
expiry  of  the  time  limit  for  making  an  assessment  or  additional
assessment under the IRO; and

liability for tax is not to be reduced under this subsection after the
expiry  of  the  latest  of  the  time  limits  for  raising  an  objection  or
applying for relief or revision of assessment as applicable under the
IRO or any relevant DTA.

161.
In  practice,  transfer  pricing  issues  arising  in  years  prior  to  the
commencement of the APA are treated as collateral issues.  Where the principles
developed  in  concluding  an  APA  provide  a  reasonable  basis,  one  approach  to
dealing with such issues may be to apply the methodology used in the APA to the
prior years (i.e. rollback).

162.
Neither the Commissioner nor the person with an APA concluded are in
any way obliged to apply the methodology agreed upon as part of the APA to years
prior to the period covered by the APA.    However, the methodology to be applied
prospectively  under  the  APA  may  be  instructive  in  determining  the  treatment  of
comparable transactions in earlier years.

163.
The Commissioner should consider whether the principles developed in
concluding an APA provide a reasonable basis for resolving transfer pricing issues
in prior years.  This would depend on the availability of all relevant information in
respect  of  the  prior  years  and  whether  there  are  any  material  changes  in  the
applicant’s circumstances in those years.

Subject  to  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  a  particular  case,  the

164.
Commissioner when considering rollback:

(a)  will  not  seek  rollback  where  the  transfer  pricing  issues  for  prior

years are rated as low risk;

(b)  will be more likely to seek rollback for a lesser number of years in
the  case  of  a  voluntary  APA  request  than  it  would  be  for  a  case
resulting from the Commissioner’s audit; and

(c)

is likely to seek rollback for issues rated as high risk.

42

As  a  rule  of  practice,  the  Commissioner  will  not  consider  requests  for
165.
rollback in the case of unilateral APAs.  However, such practice would not affect
the Commissioner’s power to raise additional assessments in appropriate cases.

The Commissioner and the person submitting the APA application should

166.
agree how and when the prior years’ issues should be resolved.

167.
The Commissioner will treat as a voluntary disclosure in paragraph 14 of
Part H of the Penalty Policy any amendment to prior years arising from rollback
where the following are satisfied:

(a)

(b)

compliance activity has not yet commenced or the Commissioner
has not initiated audit with respect to the prior years’ returns; and

as a result of providing information for an APA, there is a need to
amend a prior year’s return.

INTERACTION BETWEEN APA AND AUDIT

Separate treatment for APA and Audit

168.    An APA does not preclude a person from an audit of its business overall.
The  Commissioner  will  treat  audit  and  APA  development  separately,  unless  the
person’s facts and circumstances are sufficiently similar to enable the methodology
used in the APA to be applied to the years of assessment under audit.

169.    However,  leaving  aside  the  annual  compliance  review  process,  the
Commissioner  will  not  undertake  audit  in  relation  to  the  controlled  transactions
which are the subject of an APA unless it has reason to believe that the person has
omitted  to  provide  information  or  provided  incorrect  information,  and  the
information  concerned  is  material  and  relevant  to  the  APA  application.
Furthermore,  the  Commissioner  will  not  duplicate  in  an  audit  work  already
undertaken as part of the audit process.

170.    Where an APA does become part of the focus of audit, the Commissioner
may verify that:

(a)

the terms of the APA have been complied with;

43

(b)

(c)

the agreed transfer pricing methodology has been correctly applied;
and

the  APA  application  and  associated  documentation  reflect
appropriately the material facts.

171.
The Commissioner will not involve in such audit the acceptability of the
transfer  pricing  methodology  agreed  as  part  of  an  APA  unless  the  omitted  or
incorrect information mentioned above affects such matters.

Discontinuance or postponement of audit

172.
The Commissioner is, generally, not to discontinue or postpone audit in
respect of certain years where the applicant makes an APA application in respect
of subsequent years.

173.    However,  the  audit  may  be  deferred  or  discontinued  where  all  parties
agree that the APA will assist in resolving these issues.

174.

The Commissioner makes such decisions after consideration of:

(a)

the facts and circumstances relating to the applicant;

(b)

any advice and recommendations from the APA team; and

(c)

other factors such as:

(i)

the co-operation and assistance provided by the applicant;

(ii)

the stage of completion of the audit;

(iii)

the issues in question;

(iv)

the  similarities  between  the  facts  and  circumstances  in
respect of the years under audit and the APA application;

(v)

the  relevance  of  information  supplied  as  part  of  the  APA
application to the prior years;

44

(vi)  whether  there  is  likely  to  be  any  significant  differences
between the outcomes under the audit and the APA and the
reasons for any differences;

(vii)  whether it is possible to finalise part of the audit and leave

the issues related to the APA in abeyance; and

(viii)  whether  entering  into  an  APA  will  assist  in  resolving  the

issues in the audit.

175.
It might be appropriate in some situations to defer part of the audit for a
short period pending completion of the APA.  The part of the audit which has been
deferred can be recommenced with written notice to the applicant, at any time, at
the discretion of the Commissioner.  Alternatively, the Commissioner may suggest
the  applicant  defer  the  filing  of  the  APA  application  until  the  Commissioner  is
ready to state its position on an issue so that the application can fully and completely
respond to the Commissioner’s concerns.

176.  Where  an  audit  has  been  wholly  or  partially  suspended  and  the
Commissioner  has reasons to believe that the APA is not proceeding in the best
interest of finalising the audit, the Commissioner may, with written notice to the
applicant, recommence the audit.  If double taxation arises as a result of the audit,
the MAP should be used to resolve the matter.

177.  Where  an  audit  has  been  wholly  or  partially  suspended  pending  the
outcome of the APA, any adjustments made to the assessments of the audit years
using a transfer pricing methodology or other information from the APA would not
affect the nature of transfer pricing treatment and the efforts spent to determine the
arm’s  length  amount.      The  penalty  loading  in  Part  H  of  the  Penalty  Policy  will
continue  to  be  applicable  to  any  adjustments  made  to  those  assessments  under
review.

178.

In summary, the following principles are incorporated into the practice:

(a)

(b)

the Commissioner will not give an undertaking that years prior to
an APA will not be audited;

prior year adjustments resulting from an APA application will be
treated as though the applicant has made a voluntary disclosure in

45

paragraph 14 in Part H of the Penalty Policy provided compliance
activity has not commenced or been notified;

(c)  where audit, including compliance activity, has not commenced or
been  notified  before  submission  of  an  APA  application,  any
additional tax under section 82A(1D) or (1F) will be calculated on
the basis of being a voluntary disclosure in paragraph 14 in Part H
of the Penalty Policy; and

(d)  where  audit  has  commenced  before  submission  of  an  APA
application, paragraph 5 in Part H of the Penalty Policy will apply
to any adjustments made to prior years under audit.

ADMINISTRATION OF APA PROCESS

Management of APAs

179.
The  Commissioner  will  prioritise  his  allocation  of  transfer  pricing
resources  according  to  the  complexity  and  risk  of  the  covered  controlled
transactions  and  collateral  issues.    Priority  will  be  given  to  APA  applications
concerning arrangements which carry higher transfer pricing audit risks.

The Chief Assessor (Tax Treaty) as the competent authority delegate has

180.
been designated to:

(a)

negotiate  the  terms  of  the  APA  with  the  competent  authority  or
authorities of the relevant DTA territory or territories; and

(b)

approve the terms of the APA.

The Deputy Commissioner (Technical) takes overall charge of the APA

181.
programme.  He will decide the following:

(a)  whether a person will be invited to make an APA application;

(b)  whether  all  or  part  of  any  fees  payable  in  respect  of  an  APA

application can be waived or refunded; and

46

(c)  whether a change to the scope of the APA can be agreed.

OFFENCES AND PENALTIES

Penalties on less serious offences

182.
The  penalties  for  non-compliance  by  persons  with  the  statutory
requirements  relating  to  APA  are  provided  under  sections  80(2L),  82(1AAB),
82(1AAC) and 82A(1H).   In the present context, non-compliance includes, among
other  things,  provision  of  incorrect  information  and  failure  to  comply  with
obligations specified in the IRO in relation to an APA application.

183.

Section 80(2L)(b) provides that a person commits an offence if:

(a)

the  person,  without  reasonable  excuse,  makes  an  incorrect
statement or provides incorrect information in connection with the
person’s  APA  application,  or  omits  anything  from  a  statement
made or information provided in connection with the person’s APA
application; and

(b)

the  statement  or  information  that  is  incorrect,  or  thing  that  is
omitted, is material to that APA application.

Section 80(2L)(c) provides that a person commits an offence if the person,

184.
without reasonable excuse, fails to:

(a)

(b)

notify  the  Commissioner  of  a  breach  of  critical  assumption
specified in an APA within a reasonable time after the breach; or

provide  the  Commissioner  with  reports  and  other  information  as
required under an APA.

185.

Section 80(2L)(d) provides that a person commits an offence if:

(a)

the  person,  without  reasonable  excuse,  in  purported  compliance
with  a  requirement  for  notification  or  provision  of  reports  and
information in relation to an APA under section 50AAS, provides

47

incorrect
provided; and

information  or  omits  anything  from

information

(b)

the  statement  or  information  that  is  incorrect,  or  thing  that  is
omitted, is material to the APA.

Under section 80(2M), a person who commits an offence under section

186.
80(2L)(b), (c) or (d) is liable on conviction to:

(a)

a fine at level 3; and

(b)

a further fine of the undercharged amount.

187.
Under  sections  80(2L)(e)  and  (2N),  if  a  person,  without  reasonable

7 years after the end of the APA covered period, the person:

(a)

commits an offence; and

(b)

is liable on conviction to a fine at level 5.

188.
The  court  may  order  a  person  that  commits  an  offence  under  section

failed to do.  If the person fails to comply with the order, the person commits an
offence under section 80(2O) and is liable on conviction to a fine at level 6.

Under sections 80(2L)(f) and (2P), if a person, without reasonable excuse,

189.
fails to provide information as required by the Commissioner, the person:

(a)

commits an offence; and

(b)

is liable on conviction to a fine at level 3.

Penalties on more serious offences

190.
A  person  may  be  prosecuted  if  the  person  commits  an  offence  under
section 82(1AAB) or (1AAC) wilfully, with intent to evade tax or to assist any other
person to evade tax.

48

191.

Section 82(1AAB) provides that a person commits an offence if:

(a)

the person wilfully, with intent to evade tax or to assist any other
person  to  evade  tax,  makes  an  incorrect  statement  or  provides
incorrect  information  in  connection  with  the  person’s  APA
application,  or  omits  anything  from  a  statement  made  or
information  provided  in  connection  with  the  person’s  APA
application; and

(b)

the  statement  or  information  that  is  incorrect,  or  thing  that  is
omitted, is material to that APA application.

192.        Section 82(1AAC) provides that a person commits an offence if:

(a)

the person either

(i)

wilfully,  with  intent  to  evade  tax  or  to  assist  any  other
person  to  evade  tax  and  in  purported  compliance  with  a
requirement  under  section  50AAS,  provides  incorrect
information in relation to an APA; or

(ii)  wilfully,  with  intent  to  evade  tax  or  to  assist  any  other
person  to  evade  tax,  omits  anything  from  the  information
provided,  in  relation  to  an  APA,  in  purported  compliance
with the requirement; and

(b)

the information that is incorrect, or thing that is omitted, is material
to the APA.

Under section 82(1A), a person  who commits an offence under section

193.
82(1AAB) or (1AAC) is liable to:

 (a)

on summary conviction

 (i)

a fine at level 3;

 (ii)   a further fine of treble the undercharged amount; and

 (iii)   imprisonment for 6 months; and

49

 (b)

on indictment

 (i)

a fine at level 5;

 (ii)   a further fine of treble the undercharged amount; and

 (iii)   imprisonment for 3 years.

Additional tax

Under  section  82A(1H),  a  person  may  be  liable  to  additional  tax  if  the

194.
person, without reasonable excuse:

(a)  makes an incorrect statement or provides incorrect information in
connection  with  an  APA  application,  or  omits  anything  from  a
statement  made  or  information  provided  in  connection  with  an
APA application and the statement or information that is incorrect,
or thing that is omitted, is material to the APA application;

(b)

(c)

fails to comply with a requirement for notification or provision of
information and reports in relation to an APA under section 50AAS;
or

provides  incorrect  information,  or  omits  anything  from  the
information provided, in purported compliance with a requirement
for notification or provision of reports and information in relation
to  an  APA  under  section  50AAS,  and  the  information  that  is
incorrect, or thing that is omitted, is material to the APA; and

no prosecution for an offence has been instituted in respect of the same facts.

195.
The maximum additional tax to be assessed is the amount of tax which
has been undercharged in consequence of the incorrect statement or information,
the omission or the failure to comply with the requirement, or which would have
been undercharged if statement or information had been accepted as correct or the
omission or failure had not been detected.

50

Consideration for taking penal action

In considering which penalty action should be invoked, the Commissioner
196.
would examine the facts of the case carefully and take into account whether the
person concerned has not had a reasonable excuse or has acted wilfully with intent
to  evade  tax.    What  constitutes  a  reasonable  excuse  depends  on  the  facts  and
circumstances of the particular case.

Model APA

Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) and Company-HK (the Parties collectively),

(For bilateral APA)
[Having regard to the mutual agreement reached by the competent authorities of Hong Kong Special
Administrative  Region  of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  (HKSAR)  and  Jurisdiction-F  on
____________ regarding  the  application  of  the  arm’s  length  principle  to  the  controlled transactions
between Company-HK and Company-F pursuant to the Mutual Agreement Procedure Article of the
Agreement  between  HKSAR  and  Jurisdiction-F  for  the  Avoidance  of  Double  Taxation  and  the
Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA),]

Intending to make an advance pricing arrangement (APA) under section 50AAP of the Inland Revenue
Ordinance (Cap. 112) (IRO),

Have agreed as follows:

Persons to which the APA applies

1.

2.

Company-HK, a company incorporated in Hong Kong and a tax resident of HKSAR, (Business
Registration Number: xxx, Address: xxx) imports, markets and distributes products P and Q into
the Hong Kong market.

Company-F, a company incorporated in Jurisdiction-F and a tax resident of Jurisdiction-F, (TIN:
xxx, Address: xxx) is a fellow subsidiary of Company-HK and carries on manufacturing business
in Jurisdiction-F.

Transactions covered by the APA

3.

The transactions covered by the APA comprise:

(a)  Purchase of product P from Company-F (Covered Transaction 1); and

(b)  Use  of the trademark  “ABC”  owned  by  Company-F  (Covered Transaction  2)  in  selling

product Q in Hong Kong.

“Covered  Transaction  1”  and  “Covered  Transaction  2”  are  referred  to  as  “the  Covered
Transactions” collectively.

Period covered by of the APA

4.

The  period  of  the  APA  is  5  years  commencing  on  1  January  20X1  and  concluding  on  31
December 20X5 (Covered Period).

i

Legal effect

5.

The APA is made pursuant to and for the purposes of section 50AAP of the IRO and binds the
Parties, for the Covered Period, to determine questions relating to the transfer pricing matters
covered by the APA in accordance with its terms.

If the Company-HK complies with the terms and conditions of the APA, then the Commissioner
will not contest the application of the transfer pricing methodology as defined in paragraphs 6
and  7  below  to  the  Covered  Transactions  and  will  not  make  or  propose  any  reallocation  or
adjustment that would be necessary in order for effect to be given to the provisions of Part 8AA
of the IRO with respect to the Company-HK concerning the transfer prices for the Covered Period.

If, for any year during the Covered Period, the Company-HK does not comply with the terms and
conditions of the APA, or the critical assumptions (as defined in paragraph 11 below) cease to be
valid, the Commissioner may revoke, cancel or revise the APA.

The  Commissioner  may  also  revoke,  cancel  or  revise  this  agreement  if,  after  the  date  of  the
agreement, Part 8AA of the IRO is either amended or repealed and this would have an effect on
the approach to pricing within this agreement.   If the APA is revoked, the APA is treated as
having never been made.  If the APA is cancelled or revised, the APA is to cease to apply or to
take effect from a date the Commissioner determines.

(For bilateral APA)
[The terms and conditions of the APA may also be cancelled or revised upon the agreement of
the Commissioner and Company-HK, subject to the terms of the mutual agreement between the
Commissioner and the competent authority of Jurisdiction-F.]

Agreed transfer pricing methodology (Figures are inserted for illustration purpose)

6.

7.

The transfer pricing methodology adopted for applying the arm’s length principle in respect of
Covered  Transaction  1  is  the  Transactional  Net  Margin  Method  (TNMM).    The  net  profit
indicator to be used is: Earnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) to Net Sales (referred as EBIT
margin).  This methodology shall allow Company-HK to achieve an EBIT margin in respect of
Covered Transaction 1 in the range of [3]% to [4]% for each of the years within the Covered
Period.

The transfer pricing methodology adopted for applying the arm’s length principle in respect of
Covered Transaction 2 is the Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) Method.  This methodology
shall  allow  Company-HK  to  achieve  a  Royalty  rate  (i.e.  Royalty  to  Net  Sales)  in  respect  of
Covered Transaction 2 at [5]% for each of the years within the Covered Period.

8.

For the purposes of computing the EBIT margin and Royalty rate:

(a)  EBIT is defined as net profit before interest, dividend income, gains/losses on sale of fixed
assets,  restructuring  expenses,  other  non-operating  items  and  income  tax,  calculated  in
accordance  with  the  Hong  Kong  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (HKFRS)  or  the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS);

ii

(b)  Royalty shall mean the royalty payable by Company-HK to Company-F for the right to use

the trademark “ABC” in selling product Q in Hong Kong;

(c)  Net Sales shall mean total sales less returns and allowances calculated in accordance with

HKFRS or IFRS.

Procedures for making compensating adjustments

9.

10.

Company-HK shall make compensating adjustments at the end of the basis period for each year
of assessment to which the Covered Period relates so as to reflect the application of the arm’s
length principle.

If Company-HK’s actual EBIT margin in respect of Covered Transaction 1 or actual Royalty rate
in respect of Covered Transaction 2 for any year of assessment within the Covered Period deviate
from the agreed range or point stated in paragraph 6 or 7, a true-up or true-down adjustment shall
be made in computing the assessable profits of Company-HK for the relevant year of assessment.

Shortfall

(a)

(b)

If  Company-HK’s  actual  EBIT  margin  in  respect of Covered Transaction  1 is less than
[3]% (i.e. the lower boundary of the arm’s length range described in paragraph 6 above),
there shall be deemed to exist a “shortfall” in the compensation earned by Company-HK
by  an  amount  equal  to  the  difference  between  Company-HK’s  actual  EBIT  margin  in
respect of Covered Transaction 1 and [3]% in any year within the Covered Period.

If Company-HK’s actual Royalty rate in respect of Covered Transaction 2 is less than [5]%
(i.e. the arm’s length rate described in paragraph 7 above), there shall be deemed to exist a
“shortfall” in the compensation earned by Company-F by an amount equal to the difference
between Company-HK’s actual Royalty rate in respect of Covered Transaction 2 and [5]%
in any year within the Covered Period.

Excess

(c)

(d)

If Company-HK’s actual EBIT margin in respect of Covered Transaction 1 is greater than
[4]% (i.e. the upper boundary of the arm’s length range described in paragraph 6 above),
there shall be deemed to exist an “excess” in the compensation earned by Company-HK by
an amount equal to the difference between Company-HK’s actual EBIT margin in respect
of Covered Transaction 1 and [4]% in any year within the Covered Period.

If Company-HK’s actual Royalty rate in respect of Covered Transaction 2 is greater than
[5]% (i.e. the arm’s length rate described in paragraph 7 above), there shall be deemed to
exist an “excess” in the compensation earned by Company-F by an amount equal to the
difference between Company-HK’s actual Royalty rate in respect of Covered Transaction
2 and [5]% in any year within the Covered Period.

iii

Compensating adjustment

(e)

(f)

In  the  event  of  any  shortfall  in  respect  of  Covered  Transaction  1  in  any  one  year,  the
deduction for purchases shall be reduced by such an amount as is sufficient to produce an
EBIT margin of [3]%.  In the event of any excess in respect of Covered Transaction 1 in
any  one  year,  the  deduction  for  purchases  shall  be  increased  by  such  an  amount  as  is
sufficient to produce an EBIT margin of [4]%1.

In  the  event  of  any  shortfall  in  respect  of  Covered  Transaction  2  in  any  one  year,  the
deduction for royalty shall be increased by such an amount as is sufficient to produce a
Royalty rate of [5]%.  In the event of any excess in respect of Covered Transaction 2 in any
one year, the deduction for royalty shall be reduced by such an amount as is sufficient to
produce a Royalty rate of [5]%.

(g)  Compensating adjustments, if any, shall be made on a year-by-year basis for each year of
assessment to which the Covered Period relates in the profits tax returns of Company-HK.
In respect of any excess for Covered Transaction 1 or shortfall for Covered Transaction 2,
an amount equal to the increased deduction shall be included in the profit of Company-F
to ensure compliance with the intention of the DTA.

Critical assumptions

11.  For the purpose of this APA, the following matters represent the critical assumptions:

(a)  The business activities, functions performed, assets employed, risks assumed of Company-
HK  and  Company-F  shall  remain  materially  the  same  as  those  described  in  the  APA
application.

(b)  The financial and tax accounting methods and classifications applicable to Company-HK

and Company-F remain materially the same as those described in the APA application.

(c)  There will be no changes or factors materially impacting the industry in which Company-

HK operates and the commercial reality of the controlled transactions.

(d)  There will be no changes to Company-HK’s product or customer base that may materially

impact on Company-HK’s business.

(e)  There will be no changes to any governmental policies and regulations, legal framework,
regulatory  and  political  environment,  controls  or  mechanisms  that  materially  impact
Company-HK’s business and the commercial reality of the controlled transaction.

12.  Company-HK shall notify the Commissioner of any breach of any critical assumptions as soon

as possible, and in any event not later than 1 month after the breach occurs.

1  For  bilateral  or  multilateral  APA,  the  method  for  determining  compensating  adjustments  will  be  discussed

during the negotiations with the competent authority of the DTA Territory.

iv

Annual Compliance Report

13.  Company-HK shall submit an Annual Compliance Report (ACR) to the Commissioner, in such
form  as  the  Commissioner  may  prescribe,  for  each  year  of  assessment  to  which  the  Covered
Period relates (APA year) at the same time when it files the profits tax return for the relevant year
of assessment.

14.  The ACR shall include the following:

(a)  A copy of the audited financial statements of Company-HK (including a detailed profit and
loss  account  and  balance  sheet)  and  tax  computation  (including  full  details  of  all  tax
reconciliation adjustments) of Company-HK for the relevant APA year;

(b)  A copy of the audited financial statements (including a detailed profit and loss account and

balance sheet) of Company-F for the relevant APA year;

(c)  A reconciliation between the amounts of the purchase costs and royalty expenses computed
in  accordance  with  the  transfer  pricing  methodology  under  paragraphs  6  and  7,  and the
corresponding amounts charged in the financial statements of Company-HK and Company-
F for the relevant APA year;

(d)  An analysis of the compliance with the APA including the information and calculations

demonstrating the outcome of the application of arm’s length methodology;

(e)  Details of any compensating adjustments made and how each was effected in the profits

tax return;

(f)  A description of any material changes in financial or tax accounting methods or principles
employed in respect of the Covered Transactions, which differ from the financial or tax
accounting methods employed and reflected in the APA application, and if there were no
such material changes in Company-HK’s opinion, an affirmative statement to that effect;

(g)  A description of any material controlled transaction that is not covered by the terms of the

APA;

(h)  A statement as to whether there has been a breach of any critical assumptions;

(i)  A confirmation that the record keeping requirements have been complied with;

(j)  A  confirmation  that  no  tax  shelters,  offshore  structures  and  tax  schemes  have  been

Confidentiality

16.  The  Commissioner  recognises  that  the  secrecy  provisions  in  the  IRO  and  the  Exchange  of
Information Article in the DTA will apply to safeguard the information obtained for the purpose
of the APA process.

(For unilateral APA)
[Spontaneous Exchange of Information

17.  Company-HK  agrees  that  the  Commissioner  may  exchange  information  with  the  competent
authorities  of  other  jurisdictions  pursuant  to  the  DTAs  between  HKSAR  and  the  relevant
jurisdictions or the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.]

Implementation

18.  Company-HK and the Commissioner wish to continue their open relationship and Company-HK
