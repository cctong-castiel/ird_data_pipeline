INTRODUCTION

Separate taxation

Salaries tax is charged on a person in respect of the person’s income
derived  from  an  office  or  employment,  or  a  pension.    If  both  spouses  of  a
married couple are subject to salaries tax, they will be separately assessed unless
they elect for joint assessment.

Separate personal assessment

For years of assessment up to 2017/18, if both spouses of a married
2.
couple  had  income  assessable  under  the  Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  (the
Ordinance)  and  were  eligible to  elect  for  personal  assessment,  an  election  for
personal  assessment  had  to  be  made  by  them  together.    From  the  year  of
assessment 2018/19 onwards, married couples are given the option to elect for
personal assessment separately as a result of the enactment of the Inland Revenue
(Amendment) (No. 9) Ordinance 2018.

Aggregation of all incomes

3.
In a personal assessment, the net assessable income under salaries tax,
the  assessable  profits  under  profits  tax  and  the  net  assessable  value  under
property tax of a person are aggregated to form the total income.    The balance
of the aggregated income after deducting the allowances, deductions and losses,
if any, will be taxed at the same rates as those applicable under salaries tax.    If
the total tax liabilities of a person can be reduced, the person if eligible may elect
for personal assessment.

MARRIED COUPLE

Meaning of marriage

4.

“Marriage” is defined in section 2(1) of the Ordinance to mean:

(a)

any marriage recognized by the law of Hong Kong; or

(b)

any marriage, whether or not so recognized, entered into outside
Hong  Kong  according  to  the  law  of  the  place  where  it  was
entered into and between persons having the capacity to do so,

but  shall  not,  in  the  case  of  a  marriage  which  is  both  potentially  and  actually
polygamous,  include  marriage  between  a  man  and  any  wife  other  than  the
principal wife.

Marriages solemnized in Hong Kong are recognized under paragraph
5.
(a)  of  the  definition  when  they  have  been  celebrated  in  accordance  with  the
Marriage  Ordinance  (Cap.  181).    Recognition  also  extends  to  customary
marriages  celebrated  in  accordance  with  Chinese  law  and  custom  prior  to  7
October  1971,  which  have  been  declared  to  be  valid  by  the  Marriage  Reform
Ordinance (Cap. 178).

6.
There  is  no  legislation  in  Hong  Kong  which  specifically  validates
foreign marriages the validity of which are governed by private international law.
A  foreign  marriage  is  recognized  under  paragraph  (b)  of  the  definition  if  the
foreign  marriage  has  been  contracted  in  accordance  with  the  law  of  the  place
where the marriage took place between persons having the capacity to do so.    In
cases  where  the  foreign  law  permits  polygamous  marriages,  the  recognition
extends to  marriages that are  only  potentially  polygamous because the  person
has not married more than one spouse.    In any circumstance where a marriage
is both potentially and actually polygamous (i.e. the person has more than one
spouse),  only  the  marriage  between  the  person  and  the  principal  spouse  is
recognized.    Any  other  forms  of  marriage  existing  concurrently  are  not
accepted for the purposes of the Ordinance.

Same-sex marriage

In  section  2(1)  of  the  Ordinance,  “spouse”  is  defined  to  mean  a
7.
husband  or  wife  whereas  “husband”  and  “wife”  refer  to  a  married  man  and
married woman respectively.    Based on the above definitions, “marriage” was
in the past construed as a heterosexual marriage between a man and a woman
and parties in a same-sex marriage would be incapable of having a “spouse”.

In  Leung  Chun  Kwong  v  Secretary  for  the  Civil  Service  (2019)  22
8.
HKCFAR 127, the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) recognized that the protection

2

of  the  institution  of  marriage  in  Hong  Kong,  being  heterosexual  and
monogamous, was a legitimate aim.    However, the differential treatment under
the Ordinance between a person in a heterosexual  marriage and a person in a
same-sex marriage entered into outside Hong Kong was not rationally connected
to the legitimate aim  and was  not justified.    As a relief, the CFA considered
that a remedial interpretation of the Ordinance was appropriate and ordered the
following declaration:

(a)

The existing limb (b) of the term “marriage” in section 2 of the
Ordinance shall be read as:

“any  marriage,  whether  or  not  so  recognized,  entered  into
outside Hong Kong according to the law of the place where it
was entered into and between persons having the capacity to
do so, provided where the persons are of the same sex and such
a marriage between them would have been a marriage under
this Ordinance but for the fact only that they are persons of the
same  sex,  they  shall  be  deemed  for  the  purposes  of  such  a
marriage to have the capacity to do so”; and

(b)

For the purposes of the Ordinance, references to:

(i)

(ii)

“a husband and wife” shall be read as “a married person
and his or her spouse”;

“not being a wife living apart from her husband” shall
be  read  as  “not  being  a  spouse  living  apart  from  the
married person”; and

(iii)

“either the husband or wife” shall be read as “either the
married person or his or her spouse”.

Married person living apart from spouse

9.
Section 2(3) of the Ordinance prescribes the following three situations
in which the spouses of a married couple are deemed to be living apart from each
other:

(a)

under  a  decree  or  order  of  a  competent  court  in  or  outside
Hong Kong;

3

(b)

(c)

under a duly executed deed of separation or any instrument of
similar effect; or

in such circumstances that the Commissioner is of the opinion
that the separation is likely to be permanent.

10.
Where  the  spouses  are  living  apart  from  each  other  pursuant  to
paragraph 9(a) or (b), production of copies of the legal documentation specified
will be sufficient evidence of the separation.    When formal legal proceedings
for separation have not been instituted or are not finalized, the spouses will be
required to demonstrate that their separation is likely to be permanent.    While
the  circumstances  surrounding  each  situation  will  vary,  each  case  will  be
reviewed on its own merits and evidence of separation proceedings in progress
will generally be accepted.    In the absence of any form of legal proceedings, a
letter from each spouse confirming the date of separation and that it is likely to
be permanent will likewise, in general, be acceptable.

SALARIES TAX

Separate taxation by default

Section 10(1) of the Ordinance provides that the spouses of a married
11.
couple, unless jointly electing to be assessed on their aggregated incomes under
section 10(2), will be separately assessed on their respective incomes on the same
basis as unmarried persons.

Joint assessment by election

12.
The  spouses  of  a  married  couple  may  pay  more  tax  in  total  under
separate taxation compared with joint assessment.    This may occur where the
aggregate  of  a  spouse’s  deductions  entitled  under  Part  4A  and  allowances
entitled under Part 5 exceeds the spouse’s net assessable income (i.e. unabsorbed
deductions  and  allowances)  while  the  other  spouse  continues  to  remain
chargeable to salaries tax.    An illustrative example is at Appendix 1.

To provide relief to the spouses of a married couple with unabsorbed
13.
deductions and allowances, joint assessment is available so that they can jointly

4

elect  to  have  their  incomes,  concessionary  deductions  and  allowances
aggregated in a year of assessment in arriving at the net chargeable income.

14.
Where  joint  assessment  is  elected  under  section  10(2)(a)  because  a
spouse has unabsorbed deductions and allowances, the spouse who would have
been liable to tax prior to the election will be liable to pay the tax charged under
joint  assessment.    Where  an  election  is  made  under  section  10(2)(b)  by  the
spouses  of  a  married  couple  who  are  both  individually  chargeable,  they  must
nominate  one  of  them  to  be  the  person  liable  for  the  tax  payable  on  their
aggregated net chargeable income.    The nomination of the chargeable spouse
is an integral part of the election process and any variation in the  nomination
will constitute a withdrawal of the election.

15.
An  election  for  joint assessment  must be  made  by  the  spouses  of  a
married couple by jointly signing the tax return for individuals or the prescribed
form issued by this Department.    It may be made at any time during the year of
assessment  concerned  or  the  following  year  of  assessment,  or  before  the
expiration of one month after the date on which the assessment becomes final
and conclusive under section 70 of the Ordinance, whichever is the later.    In
addition,  the  Commissioner  may  allow  an  extension  of  time  for  making  an
election  in  circumstances  as  he  considers  to  be  reasonable,  including,  for
instance, when either spouse has been absent from Hong Kong for an extended
time or a spouse has unabsorbed deductions and allowances agreed only after
the expiration of the election period.

For joint assessment purposes, marriages which occur during a year
16.
of assessment are deemed to have taken place at the commencement of that year.
Therefore, the total incomes which accrued to a married couple in the year of
marriage, irrespective of whether before and after marriage, will be taken into
account in ascertaining their combined net chargeable income.    In the case of
the  death  of  a  spouse,  an  executor  has  the  same  right  of  election  for  joint
assessment as the deceased would have had.

Withdrawal  of  an  election  for  joint  assessment  must  be  made  in
17.
writing  and  jointly  signed  by  the  married  couple.    The  time  limit  for
withdrawing an election is the same as that for making an election.    If a joint
assessment election is withdrawn, the assessment position of each spouse will
be restored to the position as if no election had been made.    Once withdrawn,

5

an  election  cannot  be  made  again  for  the  same  year  of  assessment.    A
withdrawal of an election is only considered to have occurred when a married
couple give a jointly signed written notification to that effect.    Where a married
couple no longer qualify to elect joint assessment as a result of reassessment,
any prior valid election which has not been formally withdrawn will be treated
as  having  lapsed.    If,  as  a  consequence  of  a  further  assessment,  the  married
couple again qualify for joint assessment the lapsed election will be reactivated.

Objections in respect of joint assessments

18.
In  general,  the  provisions  for  objection  under  section  64  of  the
Ordinance equally apply to separate taxation and joint assessment.    However,
where  a  married  couple  have  made  an  election  for  joint  assessment  under
sections 10(2)(a) and a spouse is chargeable  under section 10(3)(a), a right of
objection is provided under section 64(9) to the other spouse with unabsorbed
deductions  and  allowances.    This  right  is  limited  to  matters  relating  to  the
quantification  of  the  unabsorbed  deductions  and  allowances  only  and  cannot
serve to reopen the chargeable spouse’s assessment, in connection with issues
unrelated to the joint assessment itself.

19.
Once  an  objection  has  been  made  against  a  joint  assessment  by  a
spouse with unabsorbed deductions and allowances, the procedures provided by
section 64(10), which are similar to the established procedures for settlement or
determination of objections, will apply.    Where a settlement cannot be agreed,
the  couple  will  jointly  and  severally  have  the  right  to  appeal  to  the  Board  of
Review.

Deductions from assessable income

20.
Deductions  of  expenses,  including  expenses  of  self-education,  and
depreciation allowances are personal to the person who incurred them.    In any
year  of  assessment  in  which  the  aggregate  of  the  outgoings,  expenses  and
depreciation  allowances  deductible  under  section  12(1)(a)  and  (b)  exceed  the
person’s  assessable  income,  the  loss  representing  such  excess  will  be  carried
forward to set off against the person’s assessable income in subsequent years of
assessment.    However, where the spouses of a married couple elect to be jointly
assessed,  their  net  assessable  incomes  will  in  the  first  instance  be  computed
individually but prior to either of them becoming entitled to carry forward their

6

loss  to  the  subsequent  year  of  assessment,  any  excess  of  expenses  and
depreciation allowances of a spouse must be set off as far as possible against the
net assessable income of the other spouse.

Loss

21.
Loss will be carried forward in the name of the person who incurred it
and set off against the person’s future net assessable income.    However, in any
year of assessment where joint assessment is elected, the loss will firstly be set
off against the married person’s assessable income and then that of the married
person’s spouse.    The balance of the loss so not set off is carried forward to the
subsequent  year  of  assessment.    In  the  subsequent  year  of  assessment,  if  joint
assessment is again elected, inter-spouse set off of loss will take place for that year.

Calculation of net chargeable income

A person’s net chargeable income is computed by deducting from the
22.
person’s net assessable income the person’s concessionary deductions entitled
under  Part  4A  and  allowances  under  Part  5.    The  concessionary  deductions
under Part 4A include:

(a)

approved charitable donations;

(b)

elderly residential care expenses;

(c)

home loan interest;

(d)  mandatory  contributions  to  Mandatory  Provident  Fund

Scheme or Recognized Occupational Retirement Scheme;

(e)

(f)

qualifying  health  insurance  premiums  (from  the  year  of
assessment 2019/20 onwards); and

qualifying  annuity  premiums  and  tax  deductible  Mandatory
Provident  Fund  Scheme  voluntary  contributions  (from  the
year of assessment 2019/20 onwards).

23.

When joint assessment has been elected, the net assessable incomes

7

of  a  married  couple  are  aggregated  into  a  single  sum  from  which  those
concessionary deductions and allowances are deducted to arrive at an aggregated
net chargeable income.

Allowable charitable donations

24.
A person is permitted to deduct approved charitable donations made
by the person or the person’s spouse.    The aggregate of the donations must not
be  less  than  $100  and  the  maximum  deduction  cannot  exceed  35% 1   of  the
assessable  income  as  reduced  by  the  outgoings,  expenses  and  depreciation
allowances  deductible  under  sections  12(1)(a)  and  (b),  which  is  referred  to  as
“the  reduced  assessable  income”.    For  married  couples,  no  restriction  is
imposed on the transfer of unutilized donations between spouses provided that
there is no duplication of claims.    In the case of joint assessment, the maximum
deduction that may be allowed for charitable donations cannot exceed 35% of
the aggregate of the reduced assessable incomes.

25.
Where a deduction for the same charitable donations is claimed by, or
has been allowed to, more than one person then the persons must agree amongst
  The  necessary
themselves  which  of  them  will  claim  the  deduction.
reassessments will be made once the persons have reached an agreement.    If the
claimants are unable to agree amongst themselves as to which of them will claim
the donation, the Commissioner is empowered to allow the deduction on such
basis  as  it  appears  to  be  just  in  the  circumstances,  having  regard  to  the
information in his possession at that time.

Calculation of salaries tax

26.
Salaries  tax  is  charged  at  the  rates  specified  in  Schedule  2  to  the
Ordinance on the person’s net chargeable income and is not to exceed the tax
payable at the standard rate specified in Schedule 1 on the person’s net assessable
income as reduced by such concessionary deductions as allowable to the person
under  Part  4A.    When  joint  assessment  is  elected,  the  tax  charged  is  not  to
exceed the tax payable at the standard rate on the aggregate of the net assessable
incomes  of  a  married  couple  as  reduced  by  the  concessionary  deductions
allowable to them.

1  10% for years of assessment up to the year of assessment 2002/03 and 25% for the years of assessment

from 2003/04 to 2007/08 inclusive.

8

Provisional salaries tax

Any  person  chargeable  to  salaries  tax  in  respect  of  any  year  of
27.
assessment is liable to pay provisional salaries tax for that year.    Under separate
taxation, a spouse will be individually charged provisional tax in respect of the
spouse’s own income.    When joint assessment is elected, the provisional tax for
the following year of assessment will be charged on a joint assessment basis in
the name of the spouse chargeable under section 10(3).

PERSONAL ASSESSMENT

Election for personal assessment

A person, who is an individual of or over the age of 18, may elect to
28.
be personally assessed under Part 7 of the Ordinance if the person is ordinarily
resident in Hong Kong (or was a “permanent resident” for years of assessment
up to 2017/18) or a temporary resident.    An individual is ordinarily resident in
Hong Kong if he resides in Hong Kong voluntarily and for a settled purpose (e.g.
education, business, employment or family) with a sufficient degree of continuity.
A  “temporary  resident”  is  an  individual  who  stays  in  Hong Kong,  whether
continuously or otherwise, for more than 180 days in the year of assessment to
which the election relates or 300 days in two consecutive years of assessment,
one of which must be the year to which the election relates.

The term “ordinarily resident” was elucidated by Hunter J in the  Hong
29.
Kong Court of Appeal case Director of Immigration v Ng Shun-loi [1987] HKLR 798:

“The words ‘ordinarily resident’ mean that the person must be
habitually  and  normally  resident  here  apart  from  temporary
or occasional absences of long or short duration.” (Levene v
IRC [1928] AC 217 applied)

“A  person  is  resident  where  he  resides.  …  When  is  he
ordinarily resident?    I think that is when he resides there in
the ordinary way.    That must be the meaning of the adverb.
The  expression  is  therefore  contemplating  residence  for  the
purposes of everyday life.    It is residence in the place where

9

a  person  lives  and  conducts  his  daily  life  in  circumstances
which  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  he  is  living  there  as  an
ordinary  member  of  the  community  would  live  for  all  the
purposes  of  his  daily  life.”  (R  v  Barnet  London  Borough
Council, ex parte Nilish Shah [1983] 2 AC 309 applied)

30.
The term “ordinarily  resided” should be interpreted according to its
natural  and  ordinary  meaning.    It  refers  to  a  person,  to  a  certain  degree,
habitually and normally resides at a place, apart from temporary or occasional
absences of long or short duration.    Further, it refers to a person’s abode in a
particular  place  or  country  which  the  person  has  adopted  voluntarily  and  for
settled purposes as part of the regular order of the person’s life for the time being,
such purposes could be of long or short term.    In determining whether a person
ordinarily resides at a particular place, the person’s subjective intention is of very
limited probative value, and is only relevant in determining whether the person
is  voluntary  or  for  other  purposes.    Whether  a  person  ordinarily  resides  at  a
place is a question of fact, and the issue depends on the particular circumstances
of each case.    There must be sufficient connection with the purpose of residing
at a place in order for that purpose to be regarded as a settled purpose.

31.
For the years of assessment up to 2017/18, where a spouse who had
income  assessable  under  the  Ordinance  was  not  living  apart  from  the  other
spouse,  the  spouse  could  not  elect  to  be  personally  assessed  unless  the  other
spouse  also  did  so.    A  spouse  who  was  neither  a  temporary  resident  nor  a
permanent resident could make an election if the person’s spouse was.    Where
married  person’s  allowance  was  granted  to  a  married  couple  who  were  living
apart, they were to be treated as not living apart from each other for the purposes
of personal assessment and joint election for personal assessment was required.

32.
From the year of assessment 2018/19 onwards, a spouse, if eligible to
elect for personal assessment, can elect to be personally assessed individually,
except where the spouse and the other spouse are assessed under joint assessment.
If a spouse is not living apart from the other spouse and both of them have income
assessable under the Ordinance, they can jointly elect for personal assessment
provided that either one or both of them are eligible to make the election under
the  Ordinance.    Where  married  person’s  allowance  is  granted  to  a  married
couple who are living apart, the couple are to be treated as not living apart from
each other for the purposes of personal assessment.

10

Election for personal assessment must be made within two years after
33.
the  end  of  the  year  of  assessment  in  respect  of  which  the  election  is  made  or
within one month after an assessment of the income or profits forming part of
the  person’s  total  income  for  such  year  of  assessment  becomes  final  and
conclusive  under  section  70  of  the  Ordinance,  whichever  is  the  later.    If  the
election has been  made  by  a  married  couple  jointly,  the  election  may  only  be
withdrawn by them jointly.    A withdrawal must be effected by giving a notice
in  writing  to  the  Commissioner  within  six  months  after  the  date  on  which  an
assessment  is  issued  or  within  such  further  period  that  the  Commissioner
considers reasonable.    A person who has withdrawn an election for a particular
year  of  assessment  cannot  make  an  election  for  the  same  year  of  assessment
again unless the Commissioner considers it appropriate to allow a re-election.

Calculation of total income

34.
Under personal assessment, incomes (including net assessable income,
assessable profits and net assessable value) of a person chargeable to salaries tax,
profits tax and property tax are aggregated and the interest payable on the money
borrowed for the acquisition of the property let is deducted to arrive at the total
income of the person.    The total income may further be reduced by:

(a)

such deductions as allowable to the person under Part 4A; and

(b)

business losses incurred by the person under Part 4 in the year
of assessment.

Interest deduction

35.
The proviso to section 42(1) allows the deduction for interest payable
on money borrowed for the purpose of producing that part of the total taxable
property  income  (i.e.  the  net  assessable  value)  which  has  been  included  for
personal assessment.    The proviso does not allow a global deduction for interest
payable  against  total  taxable  property  income.
  The  amount  of  interest
deductible  has  to  be  restricted  to  the  net  assessable  value  of  the  property
concerned.    Thus,  where  there  are  more  than  one  property  producing  net
assessable value, the computation of allowable interest would involve a two-step
process:

11

(a)

(b)

ascertain  the  interest  payable  in  respect  of  the  loan(s)  for
acquiring  each  of  the  properties  which  produced  the  net
assessable value; and

compare  the  individual  loan  interest  amount  with  the  net
assessable value of that particular property of which the loan
interest was incurred to determine the amount deductible.

For a married couple who have elected for personal assessment jointly,
36.
their  reduced  total  incomes  (i.e.  the  total  incomes  reduced  by  concessionary
deductions  and  losses  from  business),  are  in  the  first  instance  computed
individually.    Their  reduced  total  incomes  will  then  be  aggregated.    For  the
purposes  of  computing  the  couple’s  joint  income,  a  person  and  the  person’s
spouse who married during the year of assessment are deemed to have married
each other at the commencement of that year of assessment.

Loss

37.
Where the aggregate amount of the concessionary deductions under
Part 4A of the Ordinance and the business losses of a person under Part 4 exceeds
the  person’s  total  income,  only  that  part  of  the  excess  representing  business
losses under Part 4 will be carried forward to set off against the total income of
the person for future years of assessment.    In general, prior years’ loss brought
forward under personal assessment will only be set off against the total income
of the person when personal assessment is elected.    Where personal assessment
is not elected, incomes of the person will be assessed under the respective heads
of charge and the loss will be carried forward for set off in the subsequent year
when an election is made.

38.
Losses incurred by a  married couple  will be computed individually.
However, in any year of assessment where personal assessment is elected jointly
by a married couple, the loss incurred by a spouse will be set off against the total
income  of  the  spouse  and  the  other  spouse  before  any  balance  of  loss  can  be
carried  forward.    In  any  year  of  assessment  in  which  a  spouse  with  a  loss
brought forward does not elect to be personally assessed because the spouse has
no  assessable  income,  and  the  other  spouse  elects  for  personal  assessment
individually, section 42(6) provides that the loss will be used to set off against
the chargeable income of the spouse who elects for personal assessment for that

12

year  of  assessment.    The  balance  of  loss  will  be  carried  forward  to  the
subsequent  year  of  assessment  in  the  name  of  the  spouse  who  incurred  it.
Examples illustrating the operation of section 42(6) are at Appendix 2.

Lodgment of returns and assessment to tax

Any  person,  irrespective  of  whether  single  or  married,  electing  for

39.
personal assessment is required to complete the relevant parts of the tax returns.
A married couple intending to  make joint election have to jointly  sign the tax
returns.

The  reduced  total  income  of  the  person  after  deduction  of  the
40.
allowances under Part 5 of the Ordinance is charged to tax at the rates specified
in Schedule  2 and the  amount of tax payable  is not to exceed the tax payable
calculated  at  the  standard  rate  specified  in  Schedule  1  on  the  person’s  total
reduced  income  or  in  case  of  joint  election  for  personal  assessment,  the  joint
reduced total incomes of the person and the person’s spouse.

41.
Where a married couple jointly elect for personal assessment and are
liable to tax, they will receive separate notices of assessment for the apportioned
tax attributable to their respective incomes, computed by reference to the ratio
that their respective reduced total incomes bears to their aggregate reduced total
incomes.

ALLOWANCES UNDER PART 5

Allowances for salaries tax and personal assessment

The allowances for salaries tax and personal assessment are set out in

42.
Part 5 of the Ordinance as follows:

(a)

basic allowance under section 28;

(b)

personal disability allowance under section 28A (from the year
of assessment 2018/19 onwards);

(c)  married person’s allowance under section 29;

13

(d)

dependent parent allowance under section 30;

(e)

dependent grandparent allowance under section 30A;

(f)

dependent brother or dependent sister allowance under section
30B;

(g)

child allowance under section 31;

(h)

disabled dependant allowance under section 31A; and

(i)

single parent allowance under section 32.

The  prescribed  amount  of  allowance  and  the  maximum  entitlement  to  child
allowance  for  each  year  of  assessment  are  specified  in  Schedule  4  to  the
Ordinance.

Basic allowance

A person chargeable to tax under salaries tax under Part 3 or personal
43.
assessment under Part 7 of the Ordinance are entitled to basic allowance unless
the person is:

(a)

assessable at the standard rate according to the provisions in
section 13 or section 43 as the case may be; or

(b)  married at any time during the year of assessment and will be

granted a married person’s allowance.

Section 28(2) provides that no person may be granted:

(a)

both a basic allowance and a married person’s allowance; or

(b)

a  basic  allowance  where  the  person’s  spouse  has  claimed  a
married person’s allowance.

14

Personal disability allowance

From  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19  onwards,  personal  disability
44.
allowance will be granted to a person who is eligible to claim an allowance under
the Government’s Disability Allowance Scheme in the year of assessment.

Married person’s allowance

Married  person’s  allowance  will  be  granted  to  a  person  who  was

45.
married at any time during the year of assessment and:

(a)

the person and the person’s spouse have elected to be jointly
assessed; or

(b)

for the years of assessment up to 2017/18:

(i)

(ii)

the person’s spouse did not have any income chargeable
to salaries tax; or

the person and the person’s spouse who were not living
apart  from  each  other  have  elected  for  personal
assessment jointly; or

(c)

from the year of assessment 2018/19 onwards:

(i)

(ii)

the person’s spouse did not have any income chargeable
to  salaries  tax  and  has  not  elected  for  personal
assessment separately from the person; or

the person and the person’s spouse who are not living
apart  from  each  other  have  elected  for  personal
assessment jointly.

The full amount of married person’s allowance may be granted in any
46.
year of marriage, separation, divorce or death, irrespective of the actual date in
the year on which the event occurred.

15

  Where a married person and the person’s spouse are living apart from
47.
each  other,  married  person’s  allowance  can  only  be  granted  if  the  claimant  is
maintaining or supporting the other spouse.    In D5/09 (2009-10) 24 IRBRD 377,
it was held that to qualify for the married person allowance, the financial support
and  the  separation  must  happen  simultaneously  (i.e.  the  spouse  claiming  the
allowance should have been maintaining or supporting the other spouse as long
as they are living apart during the relevant year of assessment).    When married
person’s  allowance  is  granted  in  this  circumstance,  a  married  person  and  the
person’s spouse shall not be treated as living apart from each other.    A claim for
maintaining  and  supporting  a  spouse  may,  however,  be  revoked  at  any  time
during the year of assessment to which it applies or within the next six years.

48.
The relationship of a married person and the person’s spouse ceases
from the date on which a divorce order becomes absolute.    In Sit Kwok Keung
v. CIR [2002] 3 HKLRD 286, the Court of Appeal ruled that the taxpayer was
not entitled to married person’s allowance in the years subsequent to the year of
assessment in which the divorce became absolute, despite his periodic payments
made to support the former spouse, because they were no longer married spouses
and he was not married.

Dependent parent allowance

Dependent  parent  allowance  may  be  granted  where  a  parent  of  a
49.
person or that of the person’s spouse, not being a spouse living apart from the
person, at any time during that year of assessment, was:

(a)

ordinarily resident in Hong Kong; and

(b)

aged 60 or more; or was aged 55 or more but under 60; or was
eligible  to  claim  an  allowance  under  the  Government’s
Disability Allowance Scheme; and

(c)  maintained by the person or the person’s spouse.

50.
A parent shall be treated as having been maintained by a person or the
person’s spouse if the parent resided with the person and the person’s spouse,
otherwise than for full valuable consideration, for a continuous period of not less
than  6  months;  or  the  person  or  the  person’s  spouse  contributed  not  less  than

16

$12,000 in the year of assessment in money towards the parent’s maintenance.

The  term  “parent”  includes  a  natural,  adoptive  and  step  father  or

51.
mother of the person or the person’s living or deceased spouse.

  A  parent  was  “ordinarily  resident  in  Hong  Kong”  means  that  the
52.
parent must have normal and usual place of residence in Hong Kong.    He or she
was habitually and normally resident in Hong Kong or resident in Hong Kong
for  the  purposes  of  everyday  life  during  the  relevant  year  of  assessment.    A
person cannot be granted dependent parent allowance in respect of a dependent
parent  who  is  ordinarily  resident  outside  Hong  Kong  solely  by  virtue  of  that
parent  holding  a  Hong  Kong  permanent  identity  card.    For  the  purpose  of
dependent  parent  allowance,  it  is  not  relevant  that  the  dependent  parent  also
received income during the year of assessment in respect of which the claim is
made.

53.
Dependent  parent  allowance  has  two  components  –  the  standard
allowance and the additional allowance.    While the standard allowance will be
granted for each qualifying dependent parent, the additional allowance will be
granted only if the parent resided, otherwise than for full valuable consideration,
with  the  person  and  the  person’s  spouse  continuously  throughout  the  year  of
assessment.    Dependent parent allowance shall not be granted (either claimed
by the same person or by any other person) if a deduction of elderly residential
care expenses has been allowed in respect of the same dependent parent.

Dependent grandparent allowance

54.
Dependent grandparent allowance  may  be granted to a person  who,
during  the  year  of  assessment,  maintained  the  person’s  grandparent  or  the
grandparent  of  the  person’s  spouse.    Same  as  dependent  parent  allowance,
dependent grandparent allowance has two components – the standard allowance
and  the  additional  allowance.    The  conditions  required  to  be  fulfilled  for  the
granting of dependent grandparent allowance are the same as those relating to
dependent parent allowance as set out in paragraphs 49 to 53 above.

The  term  “grandparent”  includes  a  natural,  adoptive  and  step

55.
grandfather or grandmother of a person or the person’s living or deceased spouse.
In respect of the same dependent grandparent, only one person shall be granted
an  allowance  for  tax  purposes.    The  dependent  grandparent  allowance  is

17

mutually  exclusive  with  dependent  parent  allowance  in  respect  of  the  same
dependant  who  may  be  in  a  dual  capacity.    That  means,  in  respect  of  a
dependant having dual capacity as dependent parent of a person and dependent
grandparent of another person, either dependent parent allowance or dependent
grandparent allowance shall be granted.    Similar to dependent parent allowance,
no dependent grandparent allowance shall be granted if a deduction of elderly
residential  care  expenses  has  been  granted  in  respect  of  the  same  dependent
grandparent.

Dependent brother or dependent sister allowance

A  person  may  be  granted  a  dependent  brother  or  dependent  sister
56.
allowance if the person or the person’s spouse, not being a spouse living apart
from the person, maintained in the year of assessment an unmarried brother or
sister of whom the person or the person’s spouse had the sole or predominant
care.    The term “brother or sister” means a full blood, half blood, adopted or
step brother or sister of a person or the person’s living or deceased spouse.    If a
person or the person’s living or deceased spouse is adopted, brother and sister
includes  a  natural  child  of  an  adoptive  parent  of  either  of  them.    “Adopted”
means  adopted  in  any  manner  recognized  by  the  laws  of  Hong  Kong.    With
effect  from  the  implementation  of  the  Adoption  Ordinance  (Cap.  290)  on  1
January 1973, an adoption order validating the adoption must be made under that
Ordinance  while  adoptions  made  under  Chinese  law  and  custom  prior  to  1
January  1973  are  also  recognized.    For  an  overseas  adoption,  it  would  be
considered  in  accordance  with  section  17  or  20F  of  the Adoption  Ordinance,
having  regard  to  the  individual  circumstances  of  the  case.    To  satisfy  the
requirement of having the predominant care, the amount of care provided by the
person  towards  the  dependent  brother  or  sister  must  have  supremacy  or
ascendancy over others; it must be the strongest prevailing one amongst others.
See D10/11 (2011-12) 26 IRBRD 207.

57.
Age restrictions are imposed on the brother or sister.    At any time in
the year of assessment the dependent brother or sister maintained by the person
or the person’s spouse must fulfill one of the following three conditions:

(a)

under the age of 18;

(b)

of  or  over  the  age  of  18  but  under  the  age  of  25  and  was

18

receiving full time education at a university, college, school or
other similar educational establishment; or

(c)

of  or  over  the  age  of  18  and  was,  by  reason  of  physical  or
mental disability, incapacitated for work.

The allowance is mutually exclusive with child allowance in respect of the same
dependant  who  may  be  in  a  dual  capacity.    That  means,  in  respect  of  a
dependant having dual capacity as dependent child of a person and dependent
brother or sister of another person, either child allowance or dependent brother
or dependent sister allowance shall be granted.

Child allowance

A  person  is  entitled  to  claim  a  child  allowance  in  respect  of  any
58.
unmarried child that the person was maintaining at any time during the year of
assessment.    From  the  year  of  assessment  2007/08  onwards,  an  increased
allowance is granted in the year of assessment in which the child is born.    The
term “child” is defined in section 27 to mean any child of a person or the person’s
spouse  or  former  spouse,  whether  or  not  born  in  wedlock,  and  it  includes  the
adopted or step child of either or both of them.    The intention of the legislation
is that any person providing care and support to a child to whom the person has
lawful custody should be entitled to child allowance, subject to apportionment
where more than one person, not being married couple, is entitled to claim the
allowance.

59.
The  term  “adopted”  applies  with  equal  validity  to  a  child  for  the
purposes of child allowance and single parent allowance as it does to the parent-
child relationship specified for dependent parent allowance.

For the purposes of child allowance, age restriction similar to those

60.
on dependent brother and dependent sister allowance, are imposed on the child.
At any time in the year of assessment, the child must be:
under the age of 18;

(a)

(b)

of  or  over  the  age  of  18  but  under  the  age  of  25  and  was
receiving full-time education at a university, college, school or
other similar educational establishment; or

19

(c)

of or over the age of 18 and was, by reason of physical or mental
disability, incapacitated for work.

61.
Subject  to  the  requirement  that  a  married  person  and  the  person’s
spouse who are not living apart from each other shall nominate one of them to
claim  child  allowance,  where  more  than  one  person  is  entitled  to  claim  an
allowance  in  respect  of  the  same  child  for  the  same  year  of  assessment,  the
allowance  is  to  be  apportioned  by  the  Commissioner  having  regard  to  the
contributions made by each individual to the maintenance and education of the
child during that year.    In the case of a married couple who are not living apart
from each other, their total entitlement to child allowance may only be claimed
en bloc by the spouse as the couple so nominate.    The nomination of the spouse
to  claim  child  allowance  may  not  be  revoked  without  the  consent  of  the
Commissioner  whose  decision  on  the  matter  shall  be  final  and  not  subject  to
objection or appeal.    In general, consent to a change of a nomination will not
be  unreasonably  withheld  where  the  change  will  result  in  a  reduction  in  the
overall tax liability of the married couple.

Disabled dependant allowance

62.
Disabled dependant allowance may be granted in respect of a disabled
family  member  of  whom  a  person  is  entitled  to  be  granted  married  person’s
allowance,  child  allowance,  dependent  brother  or  dependent  sister  allowance,
dependent parent allowance, dependent grandparent allowance or a deduction of
elderly residential care expenses.    The disabled dependant must be eligible to
claim an allowance under the Government’s Disability Allowance Scheme.

In  the  case  of  a  disabled  dependent  child  in  respect  of  whom  child
63.
allowance  is  apportioned  and  granted  to  more  than  one  person  for  a  year  of
assessment, disabled dependant allowance granted in respect of the same child
for that year of assessment is also required to be apportioned among the persons
on the same basis.

Single parent allowance

64.
Single parent allowance may be claimed if, at any time during the year
of assessment, a person had the sole or predominant care of a dependent child in
respect  of  whom  the  person  is  entitled  to  claim  a  child  allowance.    The

20

allowance is of a prescribed amount and does not increase with the number of
children concerned.    The term “sole or predominant care” relates to custodial
responsibility  for  the  child,  i.e.  the  actual  day-to-day  care,  supervision,  well-
being and control of the child and the onus of proof lies with the person making
the  claim.    To  satisfy  the  requirement  of  having  the  predominant  care,  the
amount of care provided by the person towards the child must have supremacy
or ascendancy over others; it must be the strongest prevailing one amongst others.
See Sit Kwok Keung.

65.
The allowance cannot be granted, however, to a person if at any time
during that year of assessment the person was married and not living apart from
the person’s spouse, or the person only made contributions to the maintenance
and education of the child during the year of assessment.    In Sit Kwok Keung,
it was held that while the provision of money was not completely irrelevant to
maintenance, this alone could not be sufficient to show the sole or predominant
care of the child.    Where custody of a child is transferred at some point during
the year, the allowance will normally be apportioned on a time basis.

Allowance on a dependant claimed by more than one person

66.
Except  under  sections  31(2)  and  31A(2)  of  the  Ordinance  where  a
child allowance and the corresponding disabled dependant allowance in respect
of a child may be apportioned and granted to more than one person, allowance
in respect of an individual as dependent parent, grandparent, brother, sister, child
or disabled dependant will not be given to more than one person in the same year
of assessment.

When it is found that, save as permitted by sections 31(2) and 31A(2),
67.
two  or  more  persons  are  eligible  to  claim  and  have  claimed  an  allowance  in
respect of the same dependant as their dependent parent, grandparent, brother,
sister, child or disabled dependant for the same year of assessment, the claimants
will be required to agree amongst themselves who will claim the allowance in
respect of that dependant.    As a practical measure, the Department will accept
a written withdrawal of the claim from one claimant in favour of the other as
sufficient evidence that the parties have reached agreement.

68.
in respect of the same dependent person has been granted to:

Except as permitted by sections 31(2) and 31A(2), where allowance

21

(a)

two or more persons;

(b)

(c)

a married person and the person’s spouse not living apart from
each other in the case of child allowance; or

a  person  and,  within  six  months  of  such  allowance  being
granted,  another  person  appears  to  the  Commissioner  to  be
entitled to the allowance,

the claimants will be invited to agree which of them is to have the allowance.
When the claimants are unable to reach an agreement within a reasonable time,
additional assessments will be raised under section 60 in a manner which, on the
basis of the information available at the time when they are raised, appears to the
Commissioner to be just.
