INTRODUCTION

Public and private funds

In general, funds that are publicly offered in Hong Kong have to be
authorized by and are subject to the applicable requirements of the Securities and
Futures Commission (SFC), including requirements under the SFC’s codes (i.e.
SFC Handbook for Unit Trusts and Mutual Funds, Investment-Linked Assurance
Schemes  and  Unlisted  Structured  Investment  Products,  SFC  Code  on  MPF
Products, Code on Real Estate Investment Trusts, Code on Pooled  Retirement
Funds  and  Code  on  Open-Ended  Fund  Companies  (OFC  Code)).    However,
there  are  no  SFC  authorization  requirements  on  privately  placed  investment
products offered to professional investors.

Funds  that  are  privately  offered  (e.g.  by  way  of  private  placements
2.
only) are not primarily subject to authorization from the SFC regarding offers of
securities.    However,  a fund that is  established in the form of an open-ended
fund company (OFC), whether publicly or privately offered, will be subject to
registration  with  and  regulation  by  the  SFC  under  the  Securities  and  Futures
(Open-ended Fund Companies) Rules (Cap. 571AQ) (OFC Rules) and the OFC Code.

3.
 Funds privately offered are not directly subject to specific legislation
regarding  their  establishment  and  operation.    However,  persons  who  offer
advice  and  services  (i.e.  regulated  activity)  to  such  funds  or  engaged  in  their
marketing  may  be  subject  to  licensing  and  regulation.
  In  general,  no
requirements are prescribed for service providers or the qualifications of service
providers of funds if the funds are not offered to the public.

Fund domiciliation

There  are  no  local  requirements  that  funds  have  to  be  formed  or
4.
established  in  accordance  with  Hong  Kong  laws  (i.e.  Hong  Kong  domiciled
funds).

Funds may be formed as a Hong Kong domiciled unit trust, limited
5.
partnership  or  OFC.    Funds  may  also  be  domiciled  in  other  jurisdictions  by
adopting  legal  vehicles  available  in  the  relevant  jurisdictions  (e.g.  a  Cayman
exempted limited partnership).

Transfers of interests in funds

 Transfers of interests in funds are not specifically regulated in Hong
6.
Kong.    The  transfers  are  normally  subject  to  the  specific  provisions  in  the
constitutive document and the process described therein.    If the sale or transfer
involves Hong Kong stock as defined in the Stamp Duty Ordinance, there will
be stamp duty consequence unless exemption provisions therein apply.

Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act

7.
  Hong  Kong  and  the  United  States  (US)  have  signed  Model  II
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) for Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
(FATCA)  which  establishes  a  framework  of  enabling  Hong  Kong  financial
institutions (HKSAR Financial Institutions) to seek consent for disclosure from
US  persons,  and  to  report  relevant  tax  information  of  such  persons  to  the  US
Internal Revenue Service.

 The  IGA  is  supplemented  by  the  operation  of  a  tax  information
8.
exchange  agreement  between  Hong  Kong  and  the  US  which  provides  for  the
exchange  of  information  upon  requests  made  in  relation  to  the  information
reported by HKSAR Financial Institutions.

Unless  specific  exemption  applies,  privately  offered  funds,  falling
9.
within the meaning of the term “investment entity” in the IGA, would have due
diligence and reporting obligations under the IGA if they are HKSAR Financial
Institutions:

(a)

(b)

funds  resident  in  Hong  Kong  (excluding  branches  located
outside Hong Kong); and

funds  though  not  resident  in  Hong  Kong  have  branches
located in Hong Kong.

If  an  entity  account  holder  is  a  passive  NFFE 1   then  a  HKSAR
10.
Financial Institution must apply the prescribed review procedures to determine
whether  the  account  is  held  by  a  passive  NFFE  with  one  or  more  controlling

1      The term “passive NFFE” is defined in Annex I of the IGA.    The IGA is available at the website
of  the  Financial  Services  and  the  Treasury  Bureau  (www.fstb.gov.hk/fsb/topical/doc/HK-
USIGA.pdf).

2

persons  who  are  US  citizens  or  residents.    In  general,  an  NFFE  is  a  passive
NFFE if it functions (or holds itself out) as an investment fund, such as a private
equity  fund,  venture  capital  fund,  leveraged  buyout  fund,  or  any  investment
vehicle whose purpose is to acquire or fund companies and then hold interests in
those companies as capital assets for investment purposes.

Common Reporting Standard

Hong Kong has also implemented by way of legislation the Common
11.
Reporting  Standard  (CRS)  for  the  automatic  exchange  of  financial  account
information  in  tax  matters,  mainly  on  a  reciprocal  basis,  with  CRS  partners.
Currently,  Hong  Kong  would  make  use  of  different  platforms  for  exchanging
financial  account  information,  including  comprehensive  avoidance  of  double
taxation agreements and the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in
Tax Matters.

Funds, which are privately offered, falling within the meaning of the
12.
term “investment entity” in section 50A, would have due diligence and reporting
obligations  under  Part  8A  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  (IRO)  if  they  are
reporting financial institutions:

(a)

(b)

funds  resident  in  Hong  Kong  (excluding  branches  located
outside Hong Kong); and

funds  though  not  resident  in  Hong  Kong  have  branches
located in Hong Kong.

If an entity account holder is a passive NFE then a reporting financial
13.
institution must “look-through” the entity to identify its controlling persons.    If
the controlling persons are reportable persons then information in relation to the
financial account must be reported, including details of the account holder and
each reportable controlling person.    In general, an NFE2  is a passive NFE if it
functions (or holds itself out) as an investment fund, such as a private equity fund,
venture capital fund, leveraged buyout fund, or any investment vehicle whose
purpose  is  to  acquire  or  fund  companies  and  then  hold  interests  in  those
companies as capital assets for investment purposes.

2      The term “passive NFE” is defined in section 50A(1) of the IRO.

3

Transfer pricing

The codification of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
14.
Development (OECD) transfer pricing rules in Part 8AA of the IRO empowers
the Assessor to:

(a)

(b)

adjust  profits  or  losses  where  a  transaction  with  a  non-
resident associated person is considered not arm’s length and
has created a potential advantage; and

attribute an arm’s length amount of profits to the permanent
establishment in Hong Kong of a non-resident person if the
profit reported is not the arm’s length amount.

15.
the following areas are of particular relevance to an investment manager:

 While the transfer pricing rules in Part 8AA apply to all enterprises,

(a)

(b)

the  management  fee  accrued  to  the  investment  manager  in
Hong  Kong  should  commensurate  with  the  investment
manager’s functional and risk profile within the overall asset
management 3   value  chain  (i.e.  the  investment  manager
should be accrued an arm’s length fee);

the  transfer  pricing  documentation,  if  any,  should  be
sufficient  to  justify  the  transfer  pricing  of  controlled
transactions of the investment manager in Hong Kong and the
attribution of profits to the permanent establishment in Hong
Kong of a non-Hong Kong resident investment manager.

After the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) package of measures, endorsed
by OECD and the Group of Twenty (G20), has become applicable, it is expected
that profits will be reported where the economic activities that generate them are
carried out and where value is created.

3    Asset management in the present context means managing fund property on a discretionary basis.
Though  performing  different  functions  with  different  risk  profiles,  investment  managers  and
advisors are both subject to the transfer pricing rules in Part 8AA of the IRO.

TAX REGIMES RELATED TO FUNDS

Fund regime (on or after 1 April 2019)

16.
The Council of the European Union had previously identified Hong
Kong’s tax regimes for offshore funds to be problematic on account of their ring-
fencing  features  (i.e.  profits  tax  exemption  was  provided  to  offshore,  but  not
onshore, funds and the regimes only allowed offshore funds to have profits tax
exemption with investment in private companies incorporated overseas but not
locally).

The Inland Revenue (Profits Tax Exemption for Funds) (Amendment)
17.
Ordinance  2019  (the  2019  Ordinance),  which  came  into  operation  on  1 April
2019, sought to remove the ring-fencing features for funds while leaving intact
other features under the existing tax regimes that are not related to funds per se.
The 2019 Ordinance only provides profits tax exemption for privately offered
funds operating in Hong Kong, whether domiciled inside or outside Hong Kong,
since  there  are  no  tax  disparity  issue  and  ring-fencing  concerns  in  relation  to
funds publicly offered.

18.
The  Department’s  interpretation  and  practice  in  relation  to  the
provisions  under  the  2019  Ordinance,  which  are  applicable  to  onshore  and
offshore funds, are set out in this Note.    Details of the tax treatments before 1
April 2019 for offshore funds and offshore private equity funds can be found in
Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes (DIPN) No. 43 (Revised) (Profits
Tax  Exemption  for  Offshore  Funds)  and  DIPN  51  (Profits Tax  Exemption  for
Offshore Private Equity Funds).    Unless specified otherwise, all the provisions
quoted herein refer to the IRO.

Offshore fund regime (up to 31 March 2019)

19.
 Profits tax exemption for offshore funds was first introduced in 2006
by the Revenue (Profits Tax Exemption for Offshore Funds) Ordinance 2006 (the
2006  Ordinance).    Under  section  20AC,  non-resident  persons  are  exempted
from profits tax in respect of profits derived from certain specified transactions
carried out through or arranged by specified persons and transactions incidental
to  the  carrying  out  of  the  specified  transactions.    To  be  eligible  for  tax
exemption, the non-resident person must not carry on any other trade, profession

5

or  business  in  Hong  Kong  involving  any  transaction  other  than  specified  and
incidental transactions.

include

in  section  20AC

Non-resident  persons

20.
individuals,
corporations, partnerships and trustees of trust estates.    In determining whether
a  person  is  a  resident,  different  legal  tests  are  prescribed  in  section  20AB  for
individuals  and  non-individual  entities  respectively.    The  residence  of  an
individual  is  based  on  the  “ordinary  or  temporary  residence”  test  while  the
residence  of  a  corporation,  partnership  or  trust  estate  is  based  on  the  “central
management and control” test.

“Specified transactions” are broadly defined in Schedule 16 to cover

21.
typical  transactions  carried  out  by  non-resident  persons  in  Hong  Kong.
Schedule 16, when first added into the IRO, contained six categories of specified
transactions:  a  transaction  in  securities;  a  transaction  in  futures  contracts;  a
transaction in foreign exchange contracts; a transaction consisting in making a
deposit other than by way of a money-lending business; a transaction in foreign
currencies;  and  a  transaction  in  exchange-traded  commodities.    “Specified
persons”  as  defined  in  section  20AC(6)  include  corporations  licensed  and
authorized  financial  institutions  registered  under  the  Securities  and  Futures
Ordinance (Cap. 571) (SFO) for carrying on a business in any regulated activity
as defined by Part 1  of Schedule 5 to the SFO.    Deeming provisions prevent
round-tripping or abuse by resident persons disguised as non-resident persons to
take advantage of the exemption.    If the beneficial interest of a resident person
equals or exceeds the 30% threshold, the resident person will be deemed to have
derived assessable profits in respect of profits derived by the non-resident person
from specified transactions and incidental transactions in Hong Kong.

22.
Section  20AC  was  enacted  at  the  time  when  the  provisions  therein
mainly applied to offshore hedge funds and did not address transactions typically
carried  out  by  private  equity  funds.    Specifically,  “specified  transactions”  in
Part  1  of  Schedule  16,  which  was  first  inserted  into  the  IRO  in  2006,  did  not
include securities of a private company.    In other words, offshore private equity
funds that made use of the service of a “specified person” to derive profits from
transactions  in  securities  of  private  companies  could  be  subject  to  profits  tax.
Besides, private equity funds might not necessarily be managed by corporations
licensed or authorized financial institutions registered under the SFO.

6

Offshore private equity fund regime (up to 31 March 2019)

The Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2015 (the 2015
23.
Ordinance) was enacted to extend the profits tax exemption for offshore funds to
cover offshore private equity funds from the year of assessment 2015/16 onwards.
The 2015 Ordinance amended the definition of “securities” in Schedule 16 to the
IRO so that a transaction in securities of a special purpose vehicle or an excepted
private company is a “specified transaction”.    Section 20AC was also amended
to  provide  for  an  additional  avenue  for  bona  fide  private  equity  funds,  which
were  not  managed  by  persons  licensed  by  or  registered  under  the  SFO,  to  be
eligible  for  tax  exemption.    An  offshore  private  equity  fund  carrying  out  a
“specified transaction” would be eligible for tax exemption in respect of profits
from  that  transaction  if  the  specified  transaction  was  carried  out  through  or
arranged by a specified person, or the offshore private equity fund conducting
the specified transaction was a “qualifying fund”.

Open-ended fund company regime (from 30 July 2018 to 31 March 2019)

24.
Prior  to  the  passage  of  the  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  (No.  2)
Ordinance 2018 (the 2018 Ordinance) on 21 March 2018, publicly offered OFCs
and OFCs with central management and control outside Hong Kong could enjoy
profits tax exemption but privately offered OFCs with central management and
control  exercised  in  Hong  Kong  were  still  subject  to  profits  tax.    The  2018
Ordinance was enacted to put in place profits tax exemption arrangements for
such privately offered OFCs.    The 2018 Ordinance came into operation on 30
July  2018  in  tandem  with  the  implementation  of  OFC  regime.    The  legal
framework  for  OFCs,  enacted  under  the  Securities  and  Futures  (Amendment)
Ordinance 2016, is set out at Appendix 1.

25.
payment of profits tax in respect of profits derived from:

Under  section  20AH,  now  repealed,  an  OFC  was  exempted  from

(a)

(b)

transactions  in  assets  of  a  class  specified  in  Schedule  16A,
now repealed;

transactions incidental to the carrying out of the transactions
referred to in subparagraph (a) above; and

7

(c)

transactions in assets of a class not specified in the repealed
Schedule 16A.

The OFC, however, was not exempt from payment of tax in respect of profits
from direct trading, direct business undertaking or utilization of assets in Hong
Kong involving assets of a class not specified in the repealed Schedule 16A and
transactions  relating  to  certain  types  of  private  companies  described  in  the
repealed section 20AH(5) and (6).

26.
Section 20AH, now repealed, required that the activities that produced
assessable profits from the transactions of the OFC had to be carried out through
or arranged in Hong Kong by a qualified person (i.e. corporations or authorized
financial institutions licensed or registered under the SFO to carry out a business
in Type  9  (asset  management)  regulated  activity).    This  was  in  line  with  the
investment  manager  requirement  in  section  112Z  of  the  SFO.    Further,  to  be
eligible  for  tax  exemption,  the  onshore  privately  offered  OFC  had  to  meet,
among  others,  the  “non-closely  held”  conditions  set  out  in  section  20AI  and
Schedule 16B, now repealed.

Co-investment partner funds under ITVF scheme

27.
The Inland Revenue Ordinance (Amendment of Schedule 16) Notice
2018 (the Notice), which came into operation on 22 June 2018, added a specified
transaction to Part 1 of Schedule 16 (i.e. a transaction in an investee company’s
shares carried out through or arranged by a specified person for, or carried out
by, a non-resident partner fund).    Relevant definitions were added to Part 2 of
Schedule 16, including “investee company” and “non-resident partner fund”.

The Notice sought to address the concern of offshore venture capital
28.
funds of losing their profits tax exemption status upon joining the Innovation and
Technology  Venture  Fund  (ITVF)  Scheme.
  The  ITVF  set  up  by  the
Government is for the main purpose of attracting more private investment to the
innovation and technology ecosystem in Hong Kong.    The ITVF, through The
Innovation  and  Technology  Venture  Fund  Corporation  (ITVFC),  a  special-
purpose  vehicle  incorporated  under  the  Companies  Ordinance  (Cap.  622),  co-
invests  with  venture  capital  funds  selected  as  co-investment  partners  in  the
innovation  and  technology  start-ups  with  adequate  presence  in  Hong  Kong.
The Government via ITVFC is a passive investor, making direct investment in
the “Eligible Local Innovation and Technology Start-ups” concurrently with the

8

co-investment partner funds upon invitation of the latter.    Details of the ITVF
Scheme and list of co-investment partners can be found at the website of ITVF
administered by the Information and Technology Commission (www.itf.gov.hk).

FUND REGIME

Legal framework

The fund regime introduced by the 2019 Ordinance added in specific
29.
and self-contained provisions on the unified tax treatment for funds (i.e. sections
20AM to 20AY and Schedules 15C, 15D and 16C).    With the operation of the
2019 Ordinance, all funds, regardless of their structure, their central management
and control location, their size or the purpose that they serve, will enjoy profits
tax exemption subject to meeting certain conditions.

30.

The main provisions of the 2019 Ordinance are as follows:

(a)

(b)

(c)

 Section 20AM gives the meaning of “fund” for the purposes
of sections 20AN to 20AY and Schedules 15C, 15D and 16C.
replicates,  with  necessary
The  definition  of  “fund”
modifications, that of “collective investment scheme” set out
in section 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the SFO.

 Section  20AN  exempts  a  fund,  subject  to  meeting  certain
conditions,  from  payment  of  profits  tax  on  its  assessable
profits arising from transactions in assets of a class specified
in Schedule 16C, incidental transactions and (if the fund is an
OFC)  transactions  in  assets  of  a  class  not  specified  in
Schedule 16C.

 Section 20AO exempts a special purpose entity (SPE) wholly
or partially owned by a tax-exempted fund from the payment
of  profits  tax  on  its  assessable  profits  from  transactions  in
certain securities in relation to an investee private company
or an interposed SPE.    If the fund is exempted under section
20AN,  the  SPE  is  also  exempted  to  the  extent  that
corresponds to the percentage of shares or interests that the
fund holds in the entity.

9

(d)

 Sections 20AP and 20AQ deal with when an exemption under
section 20AN or 20AO does not apply to a fund and a SPE.
If the fund or the SPE (specified body) carries out transactions
in  shares,  stocks,  debentures,  loan  stocks,  funds,  bonds  or
notes (specified securities) of, or issued by, a private company,
the  following  factors  all  contribute  to  the  end  result  of
whether an exemption under section 20AN or 20AO is to be
available to the specified body:

(i)

the company holding or not holding, whether directly or
indirectly, immovable property;

(ii)

the period of the company’s specified securities being
held by the specified body;

(iii)  the specified body having or not having control over the

company; and

(iv)  the level of short-term assets held by the company.

Section 20AR provides that sections 20AP and 20AQ do not
apply to a partner fund that is a party to an agreement to which
ITVFC is also a party.

Section  20AS  deals  with  when  an  exemption  under  section
20AN does not apply to an OFC.

Section 20AT provides that if the instrument of incorporation
of an OFC provides for the division of its scheme property (as
defined by section 112A of the SFO) into separate parts, each
of which is a sub-fund, then each sub-fund is to be regarded
as  an  OFC  for  computing  the  assessable  profits  of  the  sub-
fund.

Sections  20AU  and  20AV  set  out  the  circumstances  under
which the losses sustained by a fund or a SPE from certain
transactions are available, or not available, for set off against
its assessable profits.

10

(e)

(f)

(g)

(h)

(i)

(j)

(k)

(l)

Section  20AW  is  an  interpretation  provision  for  sections
20AX and 20AY and Schedules 15C and 15D.

Sections  20AX  and  20AY  set  out  the  circumstances  under
which  the  assessable  profits  of  a  fund  or  a  SPE  are  to  be
regarded as the assessable profits of a resident person if the
resident person has a beneficial interest in the fund or SPE.

Schedules  15C  and  15D  provide  for  how  the  amounts  of
assessable  profits  of  resident  persons  are  to  be  ascertained
under sections 20AX and 20AY respectively.

 Schedule 16C sets out the classes of assets specified for the
transactions for the purposes of section 20AN.

31.
Since  the  unified  tax  treatment  for  funds  applies  to  OFCs,  sections
20AG to 20AL, Schedule 15B for ascertaining the amount of assessable profits
of a resident person in an OFC, Schedule 16A concerning the classes of assets
specified for the purposes of section 20AH, and Schedule 16B concerning the
non-closely held requirement for OFC were repealed under the 2019 Ordinance.

Commencement Date

32.
The 2019 Ordinance came into  operation on  1 April 2019.    It does
not have any retrospective effect.    A fund within the meaning of section 20AM,
which meets the conditions in sections 20AN to 20AS, can enjoy the profits tax
exemption from that day onwards.

On  and  after  1 April  2019,  a  reference  in  section  20AC  to  a  “non-

33.
resident person” does not include a “fund” within the meaning of section 20AM.
This interpretation applies only for any year of assessment commencing on or
after 1 April 2019.    In other words, on and after 1 April 2019, a “non-resident
person”  in  section  20AC  refers  to  a  non-resident  non-fund  person  or  entity,
including a non-resident individual and a non-resident business undertaking.

34.
If an arrangement meets the definition of “fund” under section 20AM,
it would be eligible for profits tax exemption under section 20AN for any year
of assessment commencing on or after 1 April 2019.    A non-resident person or
entity which does not meet the definition of “fund” under section 20AM but can

11

satisfy the exemption conditions under section 20AC could continue to enjoy tax
exemption thereunder.

Example 1

Fund-F, an investment scheme, was centrally managed and controlled
in  Jurisdiction-F.    Fund-F  closed  its  accounts  on  31  December.
Fund-F did not carry out any other business in Hong Kong other than
carrying out the transaction in Hong Kong to acquire 1,000 shares of
Company-HK  listed  on  the  Hong  Kong  Stock  Exchange  in  January
2018.    In  January  2019,  Fund-F  sold  500  shares  in  Company-HK
and  made  a  profit.    In  May  2019,  Fund-F  sold  the  remaining  500
shares in Company-HK and also made a profit.

Fund-F was a non-resident entity before 1 April 2019.    Since Fund-F
did not carry on any other business in Hong Kong other than carrying
out  the  transaction  to  sell  500  shares  of  Company-HK  during  the
period from 1 January to 31 March 2019, Fund-F should be entitled to
profits tax exemption provided under section 20AC in respect of the
profits derived therefrom.    If Fund-F satisfied the definition of “fund”
in section 20AM on and after 1 April 2019, Fund-F should be entitled
to profits tax  exemption provided under section 20AN in respect  of
the  profits  derived  from  the  sale  of  the  remaining  500  shares  in
Company-HK  in  May  2019.    Overall,  Fund-F  was  exempted  from
payment of tax in respect of the profits derived from the sale of 1,000
shares in Company-HK during the basis period from 1 January to 31
December 2019 for the year of assessment 2019/20.

WHAT FUND MEANS

Meaning of fund

Encompassed concepts

The definition of “fund” in section 20AM replicates, with necessary
35.
modifications, that of “collective investment scheme” in section 1 of Part 1 of
Schedule 1 to the SFO.    The definition of “collective investment scheme” in the

12

SFO encompasses the concepts of “arrangement”, “participating”, “pooling” and
“purpose”.
  The  conditions  bring  within  the  meaning  of  “fund”  those
arrangements  that,  broadly,  have  the  characteristics  of  pooled  investment.
Section  20AM(2)  provides  that  an  arrangement  in  respect  of  any  property  is
qualified as a fund if at all times during the basis period for the year of assessment
all the following three conditions are satisfied:

(a)

the arrangement must provide‒

(b)

(c)

(i)

 for  the  property  to  be  managed  as  a  whole  by,  or  on
behalf of, the person operating the arrangement; or

(ii)

for the contributions of the persons participating in the
arrangement  (participating  persons)  and  the  profits  or
income to be pooled; or

(iii)  for both (i) and (ii); and

the participating persons do not have day-to-day control over
the management of the property even if they have the right to
be  consulted  on,  or  to  give  directions  in  respect  of,  the
management of the property; and

the purpose or effect (or pretended purpose or effect) of the
arrangement  must  be  to  enable  the  participating  persons,
whether by acquiring any right, interest, title or benefit in the
property or any part of the property or otherwise, to participate
in or receive–

(i)  profits, income or other returns represented to arise (or

to  be  likely  to  arise)  from  the  acquisition,  holding,
management or disposal of the property (or any part of
the property), or sums represented to be paid (or to be
likely  to  be  paid)  out  of  any  such  profits,  income  or
other returns; or

(ii)  a payment or other returns arising from the acquisition,
holding or disposal of, the exercise of any right in, the

13

redemption of, or the expiry of, any right, interest, title
or benefit in the property or any part of the property.

Arrangement in respect of property

An  “arrangement”  is  not  defined  in  the  IRO 4   and  should  be  wide
36.
enough  to  cover  different  types  of  bona  fide  funds  in  operation,  regardless  of
their structure, their central management and control location, their size or the
purpose that they serve.    Funds as arrangements can take different legal forms,
including (but not limited to):

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

a  mutual  corporation  (e.g.  a  Hong  Kong  OFC,  a  United
Kingdom  open-ended  investment  company  and  a  Belgian
Société d’Investissement à Capital Variable);

a  limited  partnership  (e.g.  a  United  Kingdom  private  fund
limited partnership and a Delaware limited partnership);

an arrangement under which property is held on trust for the
participating  persons  by  a  trustee  (e.g.  a  United  Kingdom
authorized  unit  trust  and  Australian  managed  investment
trust); or

an  arrangement  that  creates  rights  in  the  nature  of  co-
ownership where the arrangement takes effect by virtue of the
law of a territory outside Hong Kong or legal arrangements in
civil  law  jurisdictions  (e.g.  a  United  Kingdom  Authorized
Contractual  Scheme,  a  Luxembourg  Fonds  Commun  de
Placement and an Irish Common Contractual Fund).

37.

“Property” is widely defined in section 20AM(3) and includes:

(a)

money,  goods,  choses  in  action  and  land  (whether  in  Hong
Kong or elsewhere); and

4      The term “arrangement” has a wide meaning.    There can be arrangements though separate persons
or separate companies, owned and controlled independently of each other, operate different aspects
of the arrangements.

14

(b)

obligations, easements and every description of estate, interest
and profit, present or future, vested or contingent, arising out
of or incidental to property mentioned in subparagraph (a).

Therefore,  the  term  “property”  covers  all  classes  of  assets  (e.g.  securities,
equities and land) and includes assets held or located in or outside Hong Kong.
The term can include amounts paid by participants to join the scheme; there is
no  requirement  that  those  moneys  be  invested  in  some  investment:  Financial
Services Authority v Fradley and another [2006] 2 BCLC 616 at 627.

Managed as a whole requirement

Section  20AM(2)(a)(i)  requires  that  the  property  is  managed  as  a
38.
whole  by,  or  on  behalf  of,  the  person  operating  the  arrangement.    The  term
“person operating the arrangement” (i.e. the operator), not defined in the IRO,
should  refer  to  the  person  that  has  overall  responsibility  for  management  and
performance of the functions of the fund, which may include investment advice
and operational services5.    The operator may have different responsibilities in
different jurisdictions and may be subject to supervision by a number of different
persons  (e.g.  trustees,  custodians,  depositories,  external  auditors,  independent
directors and compliance committees)6.

The operator will often be responsible for ensuring that all the day-to-
39.
day  activities  of  operating  a  fund  are  carried  out  competently.    This  may
comprise a wide range of activities which include managing the investments in
accordance with the objective of a fund, valuation, administration, accounting,
promotion and distribution.

40.
The operator when operating the arrangement may engage a “specified
person”  as  defined  in  section  20AN(6)  to  carry  out  or  arrange  in  Hong  Kong
transactions which may be qualifying or non-qualifying.    In relation to a fund
in  trust  form,  the  trustee  is  legally  in  charge  of  the  trust  estate  and  ultimately
responsible to the beneficiaries (i.e. unit holders) and hence is considered to be
the  fund’s  operator.    The  trustee  (if  a  specified  person),  as  the  operator,  of  a

5

The meaning of the term “operator” used by International Organisation of Securities Commissions
(IOSCO) is adopted in this DIPN.    See IOSCO Public Document No. 40, Report on Investment
Management  - Principles for  the  Regulation of  Collective  Investment  Schemes and Explanatory
Memorandum, IOSCO Technical Committee, October 1994.
See  IOSCO  Public  Document  No.  69, Principles  for  the  Supervision  of  Operators  of  Collective
Investment Schemes, IOSCO Technical Committee, September 1997.

15

fund  in  trust  form  may  directly  carry  out  or  arrange  such  transactions,  or  the
trustee (if not a specified person) may engage a specified person to carry out or
arrange such transactions.

In  determining  whether  the  operator’s  management  managed  the
41.
property “as a whole”, consideration has to be given to the arrangement in fact
operated, rather than requiring there to be an enforceable right of management.
Whether that condition is satisfied requires an overall assessment and evaluation
of the relevant facts.    For that purpose, it is necessary to identify: what is “the
property”;  and  what  is  the  management  thereof  which  is  directed  towards
achieving  the  contemplated  income  or  profit.    It  is  not  necessary  that  there
should  be  no  individual  management  activity,  only  that  the  nature  of  the
arrangement is that, in essence, the property  is managed as a whole, to which
question the amount of individual management of the property would plainly be
relevant:  Financial  Conduct Authority  v  Capital Alternatives  Ltd  [2014]  3 All
ER 780.

Pooling requirement

requires

the  pooling  of

Section  20AM(2)(a)(ii)

the  capital
42.
contributions of the participating persons and the profits or income from which
payment is made to them.    The term “participating persons” is not defined and
refers  to  the  investors  in  a  particular  arrangement.    In  short,  participating
persons or participants are the beneficial owners of interests in the arrangements
or the property underlying the arrangements whether they have legal ownership
of  their  interests7.    The  participating  persons  of  a fund  in  limited  partnership
form  are  the  limited  partners  whereas  the  participating  persons  of  a  fund
structured as an OFC are the shareholders.

The  word  “pool”  is  not  defined  and  should  be  accorded  its  literal
43.
meaning8.    Reading as a whole, the term “participating persons” used in section
20AM(2)  refers  to  participants  or  investors  of  a  pooled  arrangement.    The

7

8

The meaning of the term “participant” used by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is
  See  HMRC  Offshore  Funds  Manual  OFM05100  Meaning  of  a  Mutual  Fund:
adopted.
Introduction – Section 356 TIOPA 2010.
According to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (sixth edition), “pool” means “put (resources
etc.) into a common stock or fund; share in common, combine for the common benefit”.    The mere
fact that participants’ moneys are held on trust for the participants according to their contributions
does  not  prevent  the  moneys  from  being  “pooled”  if  the  moneys  are  aggregated  or  collectively
managed  rather  than  separately  held  and  separately  managed:  Financial  Services  Authority  v
Fradley and another [2006] 2 BCLC 616 at 626.

16

capital  contributions  from  multiple  investors  and  their  profits  or  income  are
combined together under an arrangement.    Though section 20AM(2) refers to
“participating persons”, an arrangement under very special circumstances may
be accepted or may continue to be accepted as a fund even if it has one investor
at a certain point in time within a  year of assessment (e.g.  during the start-up
period or winding-down period).    However, it is apparent that an arrangement
intended to have one single investor only is unlikely an arrangement under which
the capital contributions and profits or income are pooled and would not satisfy
the “pooling” requirement.

44.
Though  the  contributions  and  profits  or  income  are  not  pooled,  the
arrangement may still be a fund if the property is managed as a whole by or on
behalf  of  the  person  operating  the  arrangement  and  other  requirements  as
required  in  section  20AM(2)  are  satisfied.    A  broker  would  not  generally  be
regarded as managing the share portfolios as a whole if the individual investors
only  engage  the  broker  to  carry  out  the  administrative  steps  to  buy  or  to  sell
shares for them according to the terms specified by each of them under specific
instructions, and the arrangements are that individual investors would direct and
make key profit-generating decisions in respect of their own share portfolios (e.g.
when to sell and the selling price).

45.
If the contributions and profits or income are pooled and the property
is managed as a whole by or on behalf of the person operating the arrangement,
the arrangement may also constitute a fund.

Separate pools of assets and different classes of interests

If  an  arrangement  (e.g.  umbrella  fund  or  protected  cell  company)
46.
involves  a  number  of  “separate  pools”  of  assets,  then  each  asset  pool  will  be
considered separately for determining whether each pool should constitute a fund.
Whether a particular arrangement with separate pools of assets is managed as a
whole as required under section 20AM(2)(a)(i) or on an individual basis taking
into account each investor’s interests has to be decided in light of all the relevant
facts and circumstances.

47.
If  an  asset  pool  has  different  classes  of  interests  (e.g.  share  classes
carrying different rights), each class of interest will be considered separately for
the purpose of determining whether that class of interest constitutes a separate

17

fund.    However,  the  Commissioner  is  prepared  to  reduce  the  administrative
burden placed on the operator by treating the different classes of interests as if
they are a single fund provided that there is no segregation of assets and liabilities
between classes of interests (e.g. the units of each different class issued in “series”
are identical in all respects and the income of all share classes of the fund will
derive from a single pool of assets in current and future reporting periods).

No day-to-day control

Section  20AM(2)(b)  requires  that  the  participating  persons  do  not
48.
have  day-to-day  control  over  the  management  of  the  property.    “Day-to-day
control” 9   means  routine,  ordinary,  everyday  management  or  operational
decisions.    The phrase does not just mean the legal ability to decide what is to
happen  to  the  property.    Rather,  the  test  focuses  on  whether  the  participating
persons can really make management decisions about the property.    Where the
contracts appear to give the participating persons “day-to-day control” but they
do not have that control in practice, the arrangement may still be a fund even if
the  participating  persons  have  the  right  to  be  consulted  or  give  directions  in
respect of such management.

The  term  “participating  persons”  refers  to  investors  in  a  particular
49.
arrangement and “control” would therefore mean having control by way of rights
as an investor.    If the fund manager, who is responsible for the overall operation
of a fund10, holds units or shares in the fund managed then that alone would not
prevent the “no day-to-day control” requirement from being satisfied.    In the
case  of  a  fund  with  an  advisory  committee,  which  would  typically  comprise
either a few key investors or independent investment experts, nothing prevents
the “no day-to-day control” requirement from being satisfied.    Particularly so
in this case as it would not be expected that the role of the fund manager would
be usurped by such a committee.    In case of a limited partnership, the limited
partners  as  the  participating  persons  do  not  have  day-to-day  control  over  the
management  of  the  property  while  the  general  partner  who  holds  a  minimal
interest  (e.g.  1%)  in  the  limited  partnership  is  responsible  for  the  ultimate
management,  control  and  decision-making  in  respect  of  the  property.    Again

9

The meaning of the term “day-to-day control” is explained in The Answers to Frequently Asked
Questions regarding Part IV of the SFO on Offers of Investments, Appendix 1, Question 7, issued
by the SFC.

10    Per Fund Manager Code of Conduct (FMCC) issued by the SFC, fund managers are responsible for
the  day-to-day  operation  and  management  of  the  fund  and  must  comply  with  certain  FMCC
requirements.

18

this  should  not  prevent  the  “no  day-to-day  control”  requirement  from  being
satisfied.

50.
Merely having a right to be consulted or to give directions does not
result in a participating person having day-to-day control (e.g. the right to a vote
at annual general meetings, to participate in an advisory committee or to hold a
veto right would not be considered to amount to day-to-day control).

In  order  for  an  arrangement  to  satisfy  the  “no  day-to-day  control”
51.
requirement, it is sufficient that any one of the individual participating persons
is not a party to exercising day-to-day control, regardless of the extent of their
interest in the fund.    In other words, all investors must have day-to-day control
over  the  management  of  their  properties  for  an  arrangement  not  to  be  a  fund.
Even if one  investor does not have day-to-day  control, the arrangement could
still be a fund.

Purpose or effect of the arrangement

52.
Section  20AM(2)(c)  requires  that  the  purpose  or  effect  of  the
arrangement is to enable the participating person to participate in the acquisition,
holding, management or disposal of the property, or to receive profits or income
from  those  transactions  or  sums  paid  out  of  such  profits  or  income.    The
requirement is deliberately drawn widely so that it applies to a broad range of
arrangements that are designed to facilitate pooled investments.    The purpose
or effect of a fund is to enable the participation or receipt by participating persons
of profits, income, or returns via the arrangement.    Such purpose or effect of a
fund is a question of fact which depends on the objective evidence.

At all times requirement

An  arrangement  will  only  qualify  as  a  fund  if  it  meets  all  the
53.
requirements  listed  in  section  20AM(2)(a),  (b)  and  (c)  at  all  times  during  the
basis  period  for  the  year  of  assessment.    The  “at  all  times”  requirement  is  to
ensure  that  an  arrangement  qualifies  as  a  “fund”  continuously  throughout  the
year of assessment so long as it claims for profits tax exemption for that year.
For a fund which is newly set up during a year of assessment, its fund status will
be determined by reference to the period from its set-up date to the end of the
basis period for the  year of assessment.    Likewise, for a fund which is being

19

wound  up  during  a  year  of  assessment,  its  fund  status  will  be  determined  by
reference  to  the  period  from  the  beginning  of  the  basis  period  for  the  year  of
assessment to the date of cessation of business.

54.
A fund may change its status during a year of assessment (i.e. from a
non-fund entity to a fund entity or vice versa).    If a non-fund entity in the first
half of a year of assessment becomes eligible as a fund in the second half of the
year of assessment, the entity will not be allowed profits tax exemption because
it fails to meet the “at all times” requirement in section 20AM(2).    Profits tax
exemption can only be considered for the year of assessment following the year
of assessment in which its status changed.

Complex and multi-vehicle fund structures

55.
 Complex  and  multi-vehicle  fund  structures,  including  master-feeder
structures  and  parallel  funds,  may  be  used  in  order  to  accommodate  the
preferences of fund investors.    The totality of facts, including the constitutive
documents, the investment mandate and the management agreements, would be
examined to decide whether the feeder funds or parallel funds constitute in law
and in fact one or more than one fund within the meaning of “fund” in section
20AM(2).

Example 2

Fund(LP)-F, being the principal fund, was a private equity fund in the
form  of  a  limited  partnership  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F  with  two
parallel  funds  at  all  times  during  the  year  of  assessment  2019/20.
The fund agreement of each parallel fund was substantially the same
as the fund agreement for the principal fund, subject to modifications
for  regulatory,  tax,  structuring  or  other  reasons.    The  size  of  the
principal fund and the parallel funds were aggregated for the purposes
of any overall fund size cap, and investors in the principal fund and
the  parallel  funds  generally  were  aggregated  for  the  purposes  of
voting under the fund agreements.

The  totality  of  facts,  including  the  constitutive  documents,  the
investment  mandate  and  the  management  agreements,  would  be
examined  to  decide  whether  the  two  parallel  funds  constituted  two

20

different funds within the meaning of “fund” in section 20AM(2).    If
the  two  parallel  funds  constituted  two  different  and  separate  funds,
each  parallel  fund  would  be  regarded  as  a  “fund”  for  profits  tax
purposes.    In the example, Fund(LP)-F, the principal fund, and two
parallel funds should be looked upon as a single fund.

Example 3

Hedge Fund-F1 was resident in Jurisdiction-F1 with a master-feeder
structure at all times during the year of assessment 2019/20.    In this
case, the sponsor formed two feeder funds that would aggregate the
from  Jurisdiction-F2  and
investors
commitments  of  certain
Jurisdiction-F3.    One feeder fund was structured as a blocker vehicle
and  was  taxed  as  a  corporation  for  income  tax  purposes  in
Jurisdiction-F2.
fund  was  structured  as  a
feeder
transparent vehicle and the investors were taxed directly for income
tax  purposes  in  Jurisdiction-F3.    These  feeder  funds  would  then
invest directly in Hedge Fund-F1.

  Another

Feeder  funds  are  often  vehicles  to  account  for  the  needs  of  the
investors and they may not have independent existence on their own.
To determine whether  the feeder funds constitute in law and in fact
one or  more than one  fund within the  meaning of “fund” in section
20AM, the totality of facts including the constitutive documents would
be  examined.    Since  the  two  feeder  funds  were  set  up  purely  to
address  the  needs  of  investors  from  different  jurisdictions  for
investment into Hedge Fund-F1 only, the two feeder funds would not
constitute  as  two  separate  funds  within  the  meaning  of  “fund”  in
section 20AM.    It would not be inappropriate to regard Hedge Fund-
F1 and two feeder funds as one single fund for the purposes of section
20AM(2).

Example 4

National Pension Plan-F of Jurisdiction-F funded retirement pensions,
disability  pension,  death  benefits,  survivor’s  pension  and  other
pension/benefit for some 18 million contributors and beneficiaries in
Jurisdiction-F.    National  Pension  Plan-F,  as  a  limited  partner,

21

invested in Fund(LP)-HK in the form of a limited partnership at all
times  during  the  year  of  assessment  2019/20.  Fund(LP)-HK  was  a
private equity fund, centrally managed and controlled in Hong Kong.

In general, a pension fund of such a scale is regulated by legislation
and  is  likely  to  operate  with  great  independence.    The  participants
and beneficiaries of the pension fund would have no direct or indirect
control or influence over the management of investments made by the
pension fund.    For the purposes of determining whether Fund(LP)-
HK is a qualifying investment fund, National Pension Plan-F would
be counted as one investor.

Sovereign wealth fund

Sovereign  wealth  funds  are  pools  of  assets  owned  and  managed
56.
directly or indirectly by governments under an arrangement to achieve national
objectives.    Their objectives usually include:

(a)

to diversify assets;

(b)

to get a better return on reserves;

(c)

to provide for pensions in the future;

(d)

(e)

to provide for future generations when natural resources run
out;

to  insulate  the  budget  and  the  economy  against  commodity
(usually oil) price swings;

(f)

to promote industrialisation; and

(g)

to promote strategic and political objectives.

Since a sovereign wealth fund may not fit in the definition of “fund”
57.
under  section  20AM(2),  section  20AM(4)  expressly  provides  that  a  sovereign
wealth fund is to be regarded as a fund under section 20AM(2).    A sovereign
wealth fund is defined in section 20AM(4) to mean an arrangement established

22

and  funded  by  a  state  or  government  (or  any  political  subdivision  or  local
authority of a state or government) for the purposes of:

(a)

carrying out financial activities; and

(b)

holding and managing a pool of assets,

for the benefit of the state or government (or the political subdivision or local
authority).

Excluded arrangements

58.
Even  if  an  arrangement  does  fall  within  the  meaning  of  a  fund  in
section  20AM(2),  it  is  further  necessary  to  determine  whether  or  not  it  is  an
excluded arrangement.    Section 20AM(5) excludes from the definition of “fund”
the following arrangements:

(a)

Arrangement not operated by way of business

If  an  arrangement  is  operated  otherwise  than  by  way  of
business  (i.e.  non-business  arrangement),  the  arrangement
will  fall  outside  the  scope  of  fund.    If  an  arrangement  is
managed as a business by a person, the arrangement will be
regarded as falling within the scope of fund whether or not the
person is conducting any business.

(b)

Group scheme

Each  of  the  participating  persons  of  an  arrangement  is  a
corporation in the same group of companies as the operator of
the  arrangement.    It  refers  to  an  arrangement  or  structure
within  a  corporate  group  and  does  not  relate  to  situations
where  a  fund  which  begins  in  a  year  of  assessment  with  a
single  seed  investment  by  an  affiliate  of  the  investment
manager.

23

(c)

Employee share scheme

Each of the participating persons of an arrangement is‒

(i)

a  bona  fide  employee  or  former  employee  of  a
corporation  in  the  same  group  of  companies  as  the
operator of the arrangement; or

(ii)  a  spouse,  widow,  widower,  minor  child  (natural  or
adopted) or minor step-child of such employee or former
employee.

The  effect  of  this  exclusion  is  clear:  taxable  remuneration/
benefits of employees (e.g. share option scheme, share award
scheme,  profit-sharing  plan,  post-employment  benefit
arrangement  and  termination  benefit  arrangement)  will  be
prevented from being turned into tax exempted distributions
through a tax exempted fund structure11.    A private pension
fund operated by a group of companies would fall within this
exclusion.

(d)

Franchise arrangement

An arrangement is a franchise arrangement if under which the
franchisor or franchisee earns profits or income by exploiting
a right conferred by the arrangement to use a trade name or
design or other intellectual property or goodwill attached to it.

(e)

Solicitor’s accounts

An  arrangement  under  which  money  is  taken  by  a  solicitor
(whether from the solicitor’s client or as a stakeholder) acting
in the solicitor’s professional capacity in the ordinary course
of the practice.

11    Under  the  IRO,  a  pension  fund,  other  than  a  mandatory  provident  fund  scheme  or  occupational
retirement scheme, is chargeable to profits tax and contributions by an employer to such a pension
fund are not tax deductible.

24

(f)

Compensation fund

The  arrangement  is  made  for  the  purposes  of  a  fund  or  a
scheme maintained by ‒

(i)

 the SFC within the meaning of the SFO; or

(ii)

 a recognized exchange company, a recognized clearing
house, a recognized exchange controller or a recognized

to  operate  under

(i)

 Publicly offered fund

The  arrangement  is  a  mutual  fund,  unit  trust  or  similar
investment scheme falling within the descriptions in section
26A(1A)(a)(i)  and  (ii).    Such  an  arrangement  is  exempted
from profits tax under section 26A(1A) and is excluded so as
to avoid overlapping of the exemption provisions.

25

Business undertaking for commercial or industrial purposes

Since the policy objective is to provide profits tax exemption to a fund
59.
operating in Hong Kong, the fund as an investment vehicle is not expected and
allowed to engage in activities undertaken by companies or entities for general
commercial  or  industrial  purposes.    To  reduce  the  risk  of  tax  abuses  by
businesses repackaging themselves as funds, section 20AM(6) makes it clear that
a  business  undertaking  for  general  commercial  or  industrial  purposes  is  not  a
fund.    A  business  undertaking  would  include  any  commercial  or  industrial
activity  without  limiting  to  those  activities  listed  in  section  20AM(7).
Specifically,  a  fund  is  not  permitted  under  section  20AM(7)  to  engage  in  the
following activities (which are not exhaustive):

(a)

a commercial activity that involves‒

(i)

any purchase, sale or exchange of goods or commodities;
or

(ii)  any supply of services;

(b)

an industrial activity that involves any production of goods or
construction  of  immovable  property  as  defined  by  section
20AP(4);

(c)

 property  development  or  property  holding  (other  than  self-
used property);

(d)

finance, including‒

(i)

 banking;

(ii)  providing capital (other than providing capital to a SPE,
or  an  investee  private  company,  as  defined  in  section
20AO(4));

(iii)   leasing;

(iv)   factoring;

26

(v)

 securitization; and

(vi)  money-lending;

(e)

insurance business;

(f)

(g)

construction or direct acquisition of infrastructure as defined
in section 20AP(4);

making direct investments that derive rent, royalties or lease
payments.

60.
The term “immovable property” as defined by section 20AP(4) means
land (whether covered by water or not), any estate, right, interest or easement in
or over any land, and things attached to land or permanently fastened to anything
attached to land, but does not include infrastructure.

61.
The term “infrastructure” as defined by section 20AP(4)  means any
publicly  or  privately  owned  facility  providing  or  distributing  services  for  the
benefit of the public, and includes any water, sewage, energy, fuel, transportation
or communication facility.

For  the  sake  of  clarity,  a  fund’s  engagement  in  “qualifying
62.
transactions”  specified  in  Schedule  16C  will  not  be  regarded  as  a  business
undertaking for general commercial or industrial purposes.

63.
activities would be covered:

In relation to property development or property holding, the following

(a)

direct investment in an immovable property to derive rent;

(b)

 provision  of  services  incidental  to  the  earning  of  rent  from
direct investment in an immovable property (e.g. parking fees,
utilities and common security services provided in the letting
property to lessees);

(c)

licenses and other rights to use an immovable property (e.g.
serviced apartment);

27

(d)

(e)

(f)

direct  sale  of  goods  or  supply  of  services  or  provisions  of
facilities in relation to an immovable property;

sale or disposal of an immovable property (or of a long-term
lease  of  an  immovable  property)  that  has  been  acquired  for
development, re-sale or disposal;

investment

direct
infrastructure
availability payments).

income  (e.g.

in  an

infrastructure  which  derives
transmission  charges,

tolls,

A fund investing in a private company which engages in one of the
64.
activities specifically  listed in section 20AM(7), would be regarded as having
“indirectly”  engaged  in  those  activities  and  such  indirect  activities  would  not
prevent  the  fund  from  being  eligible  for  profits  tax  exemption  under  section
20AN.

65.
An  arrangement  will  only  qualify  as  a  fund  if  it  meets  all  the
requirements set out in section 20AM(2)(a), (b) and (c) at all times during the
basis period for the year of assessment.    The “at all times” requirement equally
applies to the “no business undertaking” condition.    In other words, a fund is
not permitted to directly engage in any trading or business activities for general
commercial or industrial purposes at any time during the year of assessment.

66.
If  an  arrangement  directly  engages  in  a  commercial  activity  that
involves the purchase and sale of goods (e.g. purchase and sale of garments) in
the  first  half  of  the  year  of  assessment  and  engages  in  qualifying  transactions
specified  in  Schedule  16C  in  the  second  half  of  the  year  of  assessment,  the
arrangement  would  not  be  a  fund.    Equally,  an  arrangement  would  not  be
regarded as a fund if part of its investment for the year of assessment is property
holding other than self-used property (e.g. an office).    As a rule, it would not be
necessary  to  look  beyond  the  fund  in  determining  whether  the  “no  business
undertaking”  condition  is  satisfied  (i.e.  commercial  or  business  undertaking
carried on by an investee private company or an investor would not be taken into
account  for  determining  whether  the  fund  is  engaged  in  any  commercial  or
business undertaking).    In relation to a fund in trust form, since the trustee is
legally in charge of the trust estate and holds the legal title of the trust’s properties,
any  commercial  or  business  undertaking  carried  on  by  the  trustee  of  the  trust

28

estate  for  the  fund  would  be  regarded  as  commercial  or  business  undertaking
carried on by the fund.

67.
If  an  arrangement  is  directly  engaged  in  both  commercial  and
investment activities, it would not qualify for profits tax exemption under section
20AN even though it satisfies the requirements in section 20AM(2).    Strictly,
an  arrangement  which  engages  directly  in  a  business  undertaking  for  general
commercial or industrial purposes would not meet the definition of “fund” under
section 20AM.    In determining whether the fund is a business undertaking for
general commercial or industrial purposes as prohibited under section 20AM(6)
and (7), a fund’s activities in and outside Hong Kong would be considered as a
whole.

Example 5

Company-HK, incorporated in Hong Kong in 2006, all along has been
carrying  on  commercial  and  investment  business  activities  in  Hong
Kong.    Company-HK closed its accounts on 31 December annually.
On 1 April 2019, Fund-HK was set up as a fund with Company-HK
and four other investors.    From 1 April 2019 to 31 December 2019,
Fund-HK used funds contributed by Company-HK and the other four
investors to carry out Schedule 16C transactions.

In  order  to  qualify  for  profits  tax  exemption  under  section  20AN,
Fund-HK  had  to  first  satisfy  the  meaning  of  “fund”  under  section
20AM(2).    Second, Fund-HK should not fall within the exclusions in
section  20AM(5).  Third,  Fund-HK  should  not  be  a  business
undertaking  for  general  commercial  or  industrial  purposes  which
carried out commercial or industrial transactions as prohibited under
section 20AM(6) and (7).    The totality of facts would be examined in
determining  whether  Fund-HK  was  a  qualifying  investment  fund
operating in Hong Kong.

29

THE EXEMPTION PROVISIONS

Exemption from tax payment

The exemption provisions are contained in section 20AN.    Subject to
68.
sections 20AP and 20AQ, a fund is exempt from payment of tax in respect of its
assessable profits for a year of assessment if:

(a)

 the profits are earned from‒

(i)

transactions in assets of a class specified in Schedule
16C (qualifying transactions);

(ii)

transactions incidental to the carrying out of qualifying
transactions (incidental transactions); and

(iii)    transactions in assets of a class that is not specified in
Schedule 16C (non-Schedule 16C class) if the fund is
an OFC; and

(b)

at all times during the basis period for a  year of assessment
either‒

(i)    the qualifying transactions are carried out in Hong Kong
by or through, or arranged in Hong Kong by a specified
person  (i.e.  a  corporation  licensed  or  an  authorized
financial institutions registered under the SFO to carry
on a business in any regulated activity as defined under
the SFO); or

(ii)

the fund is a qualified investment fund.

Scope of exemption

An arrangement which meets the definition of “fund” in section 20AM
69.
and fulfils the exemption conditions specified in section 20AN would be eligible
for profits tax exemption in respect of its qualifying transactions. The exemption
also  covers  profits  derived  from  the  incidental  transactions  provided  that  the

30

fund’s trading receipts from the incidental transactions do not exceed 5% of the
total of the fund’s trading receipts from both the qualifying transactions and the
incidental transactions.

A fund can carry on any trade, profession or business in Hong Kong,
70.
involving  transactions  other  than  the  qualifying  transactions  and  transactions
incidental to the carrying out of the qualifying transactions.    The tax-exempted
profits of the fund from qualifying transactions and incidental transactions will
not be tainted even if the fund is taxed on its profits derived from transactions in
assets of non-Schedule 16C class (non-qualifying transactions).    If the profits
or gains derived from non-qualifying transactions are offshore or capital in nature,
they  remain  not  chargeable  to  profits  tax.    It  should  be  noted  that  an
arrangement must first satisfy the definition of “fund” under section 20AM in
order to qualify for profits tax exemption.    If an arrangement is in substance a
business undertaking for general commercial or industrial purposes, it is not a
fund  and  its  profits  derived  in  a  year  of  assessment  from  qualifying  and  non-
qualifying transactions can be charged to profits tax.    If the arrangement is not
a fund in the first place, the provisions for profits tax exemption in section 20AN
would not be applicable to the arrangement.

71.
An  OFC  incorporated  under  Part  IVA  of  the  SFO  is  an  open-ended
collective investment scheme and is subject to the regulatory requirements of the
SFC.    Publicly offered OFCs are allowed to invest in asset classes in accordance
with  the  SFC’s  product  code  requirements  and  authorization  conditions  (i.e.
mainly in securities and futures).    Privately offered OFCs are allowed to invest
mainly  in  asset  types  the  management  of  which  would  constitute  a  Type  9
regulated activity in accordance with the investment scope laid down in the OFC
Code and other  asset  classes  not  exceeding 10% gross  asset  value  of  the  OFC
(10% de minimis rule).  Since an OFC is regulated by the SFC and in particular,
a privately offered OFC is required to comply with the 10% de minimis rule as
per the OFC Code, profits tax exemption is given to the OFC in respect of profits
derived from transactions in permissible asset classes which include qualifying
and non-qualifying transactions.    Despite section 20AN, the OFC will be taxed
on its profits from carrying on a direct trading or direct business undertaking in
Hong Kong in assets of a class not specified in Schedule 16C or holding of assets
of a non-Schedule 16C class that are utilized to generate income.    Thus, the tax-
exempt profits of the  OFC will not be tainted.    If an OFC breaches the OFC
Rules and/or OFC Code (including the 10% de minimis rule) in a way that results

31

in cancellation of registration by the SFC, the OFC will not qualify for profits
tax exemption under section 20AN.

Classes of assets for qualifying transactions

Schedule  16C  to  the  IRO  contains  the  list  of  11  classes  of  assets
72.
specified for qualifying transactions.    It covers typical transactions carried out
by funds:

(a)

securities;

(b)

shares, stocks, debentures, loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes
of, or issued by, a private company;

(c)

futures contracts;

(d)

(e)

(f)

foreign  exchange  contracts  under  which  the  parties  to  the
contracts  agree  to  exchange  different  currencies  on  a
particular date;

deposits  other  than  those  made  by  way  of  a  money-lending
business;

deposits (as defined by section 2(1) of the Banking Ordinance
(Cap.  155))  made  with  a  bank  (as  defined  by  Part  1  of
Schedule 1 to the SFO);

(g)

certificates of deposit (as defined by Part 1 of Schedule 1 to
the SFO);

(h)

exchange-traded commodities;

(i)

foreign currencies;

(j)

(k)

OTC derivative products (as defined by Part 1 of Schedule 1
to the SFO); and

an investee  company’s shares co-invested  by a partner fund
and ITVFC under the ITVF Scheme.

32

Part 1 of Schedule 16C covers the specified transactions in Schedule

73.
16  and  classes  of  assets  specified  in  Schedule  16A  which  has  been  repealed.
The definitions in Part 2 of Schedule 16C are based on those in Schedule 16 with
the necessary modifications.    The important definitions of the classes of assets
specified for qualifying transactions and their interpretations are at Appendix 2.

74.
To cater for changes in the financial products traded in the market, the
Commissioner is empowered under section 20AN(5) to amend Schedule 16C by
notice published in the Gazette.

Incidental transactions

75.
A  fund  may  carry  out  transactions  in  Hong  Kong  which  are  not
qualifying  transactions  but  incidental  to  the  carrying  out  of  the  qualifying
transactions.    The  term  “incidental  transaction”  is  not  defined.    The  word
“incidental”,  which  is  accorded  its  common  meaning 12 ,  should  cover  various
modes of operation of different funds.    Whether particular transactions carried
out by a fund are “incidental transactions” is a question of fact, the answer to
which can only be determined by reference to the particular mode of operation
of  the  fund  concerned.    Typical  incidental  transactions  include  custody  of
securities, and receipt of interest or dividend on securities acquired through the
qualifying transactions.

76.
The  incidental  transactions  carried  out  in  the  relevant  year  of
assessment are subject to the 5% threshold and tax exemption is to be allowed in
respect  of  the  profits  derived  therefrom.    Section  20AN(4)  provides  that  the
exemption  under  section  20AN(2)  does  not  apply  to  assessable  profits  earned
from  incidental  transactions  if  the  percentage  calculated  according  to  the
following formula exceeds 5%:

A/B × 100%

  where–

A  =

the  fund’s  trading  receipts  from  incidental
transactions in the basis period;

12    According to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (sixth edition), “incidental” means “liable to
happen to; naturally attaching to; occurring as something casual or of secondary importance; not
directly relevant to; following (up) on as a subordinate circumstance”.

33

B  =

the total of the fund’s trading receipts from
qualifying
incidental
transactions  and
transactions in the basis period.

77.
The  5%  threshold  refers  to  the  situation  where  the  fund’s  trading
receipts from the incidental transactions do not exceed 5% of the total trading
receipts  from  the  qualifying  transactions  and  the  incidental  transactions  taken
together.    If  the  5%  threshold  is  exceeded,  the  whole  of  the  fund’s  trading
receipts from the incidental transactions (i.e. not just the amount in excess of the
5%  threshold)  will  be  chargeable  to  profits  tax.    Profits  derived  from  the
qualifying
Incidental transactions should have been chargeable profits and the policy intent
of the 5% threshold is to provide operational convenience only.

transactions,  however,  will  remain  fully  exempt  from

tax.

78.
The holding of a debt instrument (e.g. debentures, loan stocks, bonds
or notes) to earn “interest income” is not a transaction in securities since such
holding does not involve two parties transacting in securities.    The payment of
“interest”  therefrom  is  not  a  “transaction  in  securities”  since  the  payment  of
interest to holders of the debt instrument merely gives effect to the rights already
attached to the debt instrument.    The receipt of interest could only be considered
as  an  incidental  transaction  subject  to  the  5%  threshold  and  not  a  “qualifying
transaction”.    Generally,  the  buying  and  selling  of  a  debt  security  is  a
qualifying  transaction  falling  within  section  20AN(2)(a)  while  the  payment
and receipt of interest from such a debt security is an incidental transaction
falling within section 20AN(2)(b).

79.
In  calculating  the  percentage  according  to  the  formula  stipulated  in
section  20AN(4),  exempted  or  non-taxable  sums,  such  as  dividends,  capital
receipts or offshore income are excluded from the fund’s trading receipts.

Specified persons

80.
qualifying transactions if the qualifying transactions of the fund are:

Tax exemption is allowed in respect of profits derived by a fund from

(a)

carried out in Hong Kong by or through a specified person; or

(b)

arranged in Hong Kong by a specified person.

34

The  specified  person  is  defined  in  section  20AN(6)  to  mean  a
81.
corporation licensed or an authorized financial institution registered  under the
SFO for carrying on a business in any regulated activity as defined by Part 1 of
Schedule 5 to the SFO.    The words “arranged in Hong Kong by” cover cases
where  a  qualifying  transaction  is  not  carried  out  by  a  specified  person  but
arranged  in  Hong  Kong  by  the  specified  person  to  be  carried  out  by  another
person (e.g. the investment manager of a fund, who is a specified person, can
arrange in Hong Kong to buy or sell stocks traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
through  an  intermediary  in  Tokyo).    In  relation  to  an  OFC,  the  investment
manager, who is licensed by or registered with the SFC to carry out a Type 9
regulated  activity  and  qualified  as  a  specified  person,  may  sub-delegate  the
investment management function to an overseas sub-manager or advisor with or
without discretionary power to buy or sell.

Qualified investment fund

Definition of qualified investment fund

82.
Tax exemption is also allowed in respect of profits derived by a fund
from qualifying transactions if  the fund is a qualifying investment fund.    The
definition of “qualified investment fund” in section 20AN(6) has followed the
definition  of  “qualifying  fund”  in  section  20AC(6)  with  slight  modifications.
In order to be a qualified investment fund, the following conditions must be met:

(a)

at all times after the final closing of sale of interests‒

(i)

the number of investors exceeds 4; and

(ii)

the capital commitments made by investors exceed 90%
of the aggregate capital commitments; and

(b)

an  agreement  governing  the  operation  of  the  fund  provides
that not more than 30% of the net proceeds arising out of the
transactions of the fund are to be received by  the originator
and  the  originator’s  associates,  after  deducting  the  portion
attributable
is
proportionate  to  that  attributable  to  the  investors’  capital
contributions).

their  capital  contributions

(which

to

35

Section  20AN(6)  contains  definitions  of  “aggregate  capital
83.
commitment”,  “associate”,  “capital  commitment”,  “final  closing  of  sale  of
interests”, “investor”, “net proceeds” and “originator” in relation to the meaning
of “qualified investment fund”.    These definitions have followed the meaning
of the same terms in section 20AC(6).

84.
For  the  purposes  of  a  qualified  investment  fund,  the  “investor”  is
defined to mean a person, other than the originator or the originator’s associates,
who makes capital commitment to the fund.    The “originator” means a person
who directly or indirectly originates or sponsors the fund and has the power to
make investment decisions on behalf of the fund.    In the context of a limited
partnership structure, generally the “investors” are the limited partners and the
“originator” is the general partner.

85.
The term of “capital commitment” means a commitment that is in the
form  of  an  amount  of  money  payable  by  an  investor,  the  originator  or  the
originator’s associate to the fund under an agreement governing the operation of
the fund and in respect of which the originator may make capital calls from time
to  time  according  to  the  terms  of  the  agreement.    The  “aggregate  capital
commitment” is the total of the capital commitments made by the investors, the
originator and the originator’s associates.

In  relation  to  a  qualified  investment  fund,  “final  closing  of  sale  of
86.
interests”  is  defined  to  mean  the  date  on  which  the  originator  last  accepts
subscriptions  from  investors  for  making  capital  commitments.    The  time  of
“final  closing”  should  be  clear  from  the  fund  document  or  prospectus  which
forms part of a contract agreed at the outset.    In relation to private equity funds
which are generally closed ended vehicles, the Commissioner would not accept
that  an  originator  can  continually  vary  the  closing  date  by  inviting  new
subscribers into the fund, thereby moving the reference point of time.

87.
Provisions on “associate” are required to prevent the fund from being
controlled by the originator and its associates.    Section 20AN(6) contains the
definition of “associate” and the related definitions of “associated corporation”,
“associated partnership”, “control”, “principal officer” and “relative”.

36

Number of investors

The  requirement  of  having  at  least  five  investors,  who  have  made
88.
capital commitments in the fund, at any  time after the final closing of sale  of
interests is not new and has already been adopted for “qualifying fund” in section
20AC(6).    In a multi-layer ownership structure with a series of intermediaries
or a fund of funds structure, it is essential to correctly identify the fund for the
purposes  of  section  20AN(2)  before  counting  the  number  of  investors.    To
determine whether it is appropriate to see through a series of intermediaries or a
fund of funds structure (e.g. feeder funds or parallel funds) when counting the
number of investors, the totality of facts, including the constitutive documents,
the investment mandate and the management agreements, would be examined to
decide  whether  the  intermediaries,  feeder  funds  or  parallel  funds  constitute
different and separate funds for the purposes of sections 20AM and 20AN.

An investor like a pension fund, an insurance company or a sovereign
89.
wealth  fund  would  be  counted  as  one  single  investor  for  the  purposes  of
counting the number of investors and determining whether a fund is a qualified
investment  fund,  even  though  they  have  a  large  number  of  participating
persons and beneficiaries.

Capital commitment

90.
The  90%  capital  commitment  requirement  in  defining  a  qualified
investment fund is the same as that for “qualifying fund” in section 20AC(6).
The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the fund is not simply a vehicle
of  one  single  investor.    The  term  “capital  commitment”  is  defined  in  section
20AN(6) to mean a commitment in respect of which the originator may make
calls from time to time for payment of the capital, which has not been paid or
satisfied by an investor, the originator or the originator’s associate according to
the  terms  of  an  agreement  governing  the  operation  of  the  fund.    The  term
“capital calls” in the definition of “capital commitment” is not defined in the IRO.
It carries the literal meaning (i.e. calls or requests for capital) and such calls are
invariably  governed  by  the  contractual  terms  laid  down  in  an  agreement
governing the operation of the fund.

37

30% of net proceeds

The requirement of having “not more than 30% of net proceeds” is the
91.
same  as  that  for  “qualifying  fund”  in  section  20AC(6).    The  reference  to  the
30% threshold is intended primarily to deny tax exemption to funds the profits
of  which  are  simply  siphoned  to  one  single  investor  who  may  be  the  fund
manager.    The requirement also ensures that the vehicle is a bona fide fund (i.e.
the fund is not simply a vehicle primarily owned by the fund manager with other
investors holding a nominal interest).

92.
It  is  not  uncommon  in  the  private  equity  business  to  reward  the
investment manager a performance fee or carried interest which is around 20%
of the fund’s profits above a hurdle rate.    The 30% threshold is higher than the
industry  benchmark  of  20%.    In  considering  whether  the  30%  threshold  has
been observed, it is necessary to refer to various documents, such as the limited
partnership  agreement,  so  as  to  ascertain  the  performance  fee,  performance
linked reward, carried interest or profit-related return (however described).    It
is  also  expected  that  fund  constitutive  documents,  such  as  private  placement
memorandum  and  management  agreement,  would  be  made  available  to  the
Commissioner to prove that the fund is established as a bona fide private equity
fund.

Section  20AN(6)  defines  the  term  “net  proceeds”,  in  relation  to  a
93.
qualified investment fund at a particular time, to mean an amount calculated by:

(a)

adding together‒

(i)

the sum of the cumulative distributions received by the
investors,  the originator and the  originator’s  associates
from the fund by the particular time; and

(ii)

the value at the particular time of all assets, if any, held
by the fund; and

(b)

subtracting  the  cumulative  capital  contributions  of  the
investors, the originator and the originator’s associates by the
particular time.

38

Distributions are always made by the operator after making provisions
94.
for  all  known  liabilities  as  required  by  the  distribution  provisions  in  the
agreement governing the operation of the fund.    Therefore, it is expected that
the “distributions” in the definition of “net proceeds” have been arrived in such
manner.

EXEMPTION FOR SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES

Exempt from tax payment

The scope of exemption for SPEs under the fund regime is the same
95.
as  that  for  special  purpose  vehicles  under  the  offshore  private  equity  regime.
The aim is to cater for a case where a fund sets up one tier or multiple tiers of
SPEs  to  hold  their  investment  in  private  companies  so  as  to  facilitate  the
subsequent  disposal  of  such  companies  by  way  of  transferring  the  ownership
interests in SPEs.

96.
With the definition of “securities” in section 1 of Part 2 of Schedule
16C and subject to sections 20AP and 20AQ, funds are exempt from payment of
tax in respect of profits derived from a transaction in:

(a)

(b)

(c)

shares, stocks, debentures, loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes
of, or issued by a SPE;

rights,  options,  or  interests  (whether  described  as  units  or
otherwise) in or in respect of such shares, stocks, debentures,
loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes of a SPE; or

certificates of interest or participation in, temporary or interim
certificates  for,  receipts  for,  or  warrants  to  subscribe  for  or
purchase, such shares, stocks, debentures, loan stocks, funds,
bonds or notes of a SPE.

97.
Section  20AO  has  replicated  the  exemption  provisions  for  special
purpose vehicles contained in section 20ACA.    Subject to sections 20AP and
20AQ, a SPE is exempted, to the extent corresponding to the percentage of the
tax-exempted fund’s ownership of the SPE, from payment of tax in respect of its

39

assessable profits arising from the following transactions:

(a)

(b)

(c)

 transactions in shares, stocks, debentures, loan stocks, funds,
bonds  or  notes  (specified  securities)  of,  or  issued  by,  an
investee private company or an interposed SPE;

 transactions in rights, options or interests (whether described
as  units  or  otherwise)  in,  or  in  respect  of,  the  specified
securities; and

transactions  in  certificates  of  interest  or  participation  in,
temporary or interim certificates for, receipts for, or warrants
to subscribe for or purchase, the specified securities.

Meaning of SPE

Restrictions

98.
The  definition  of  “SPE”  in  section  20AO(4)  is  the  same  as  the
definition of “special purpose vehicle” in section 20ACA(2).    A SPE means a
corporation, partnership, trustee of a trust estate or any other entity that:

(a)

is wholly or partially owned by a fund;

(b)

(c)

(d)

is  established  solely  for  the  purpose  of  holding,  whether
directly or indirectly, and administering one or more investee
private companies;

is  incorporated,  registered  or  appointed  in  or  outside  Hong
Kong;

does not carry on any trade or activities except for the purpose
of holding, whether directly or indirectly, and administering
one or more investee private companies; and

(e)

is not itself a fund or an investee private company.

40

Legal forms

A  SPE  is  a  purpose-built  structuring  tool  of  funds.    It  may  be  a
99.
corporation,  partnership,  trustee  of  a  trust  estate  or  any  other  entity  which  is
incorporated,  registered  or  appointed  in  or  outside  Hong  Kong.    It  can  be
wholly or partially owned by a fund and is established solely for the purpose of
holding, directly or indirectly, and administering one or more investee private
companies.    The term “any other entity” is included in the definition of “SPE”
so as to facilitate the use of various forms of SPE by the industry.

Permitted activities

100.
A SPE, as defined in section 20AO(4), is not allowed to carry on any
trade or activities other than for the purpose of holding, directly or indirectly, and
administering one or more investee private companies.    It should not engage in
an active business with buying and selling transactions (i.e. trading transactions).
Equally, it cannot derive service fees from a fund for the provision of services.
The SPE is expected to only derive passive dividend income from one or more
investee private companies.

101.
Since the words “holding” and “administering” are not defined, they
should  be  interpreted  according  to  their  literal  meaning  (i.e.  holding  and
administering investee private companies in the capacity as a shareholder or a
holder of participation or equity interest).    The “holding” and “administering”
of  an  investee  private  company  can  be  direct  or  through  other  persons.      It
should  not  be  interpreted  as  the  management  of  the  business  of  the  investee
private  companies  (i.e.  maintenance  and  administration  of  the  business  of
investee private companies would not be allowed).    Hence, the activities of a
SPE are restricted to:

(a)

(b)

(c)

the  review  of  financial  statements  of  investee  private
companies  normally  made  available  to  shareholders  or
investors;

attending  the  shareholders’  meetings  of  investee  private
companies;

opening  bank  accounts  for  collection  of  dividends  or
investment receipts; and

41

(d)

appointing company secretary and auditor.

If the obligations undertaken by a SPE far exceed those normally attached to a
shareholder, the SPE would not satisfy the exemption requirement.

The SPE in this context is not meant to be an investee private company.
102.
In practice, the investee private company can be identified after examining the
transactions and having regard to the fund documents, including the investment
mandate of the fund.

Interposed SPE

103.
 The term “interposed SPE” is defined in section 20AO(4) to have the
same meaning of “interposed special purpose vehicle” in section 20ACA(2) as
follows:

(a)

(b)

in relation to a SPE that has an indirect beneficial interest in
an investee private company through an interposed person that
is a SPE, means the interposed person; or

in relation to a SPE that has an indirect beneficial interest in
an  investee  private  company  through  a  series  of  2  or  more
interposed persons that are SPEs, means any of the interposed
persons.

The definition of “interposed SPE” has made it clear that an interposed
104.
SPE is also a SPE.   The “SPE” and “interposed SPE” will only be exempt from
profits tax to the extent corresponding to the percentage of ownership interests
held by the fund which is exempt from profits tax under section 20AN(2) in the
year of assessment.    A SPE indirectly owned by a fund is an “interposed SPE”.

SPE as holding platform

The provisions in section 20AO will remain applicable to a holding
105.
platform  entity  if  the  holding  platform  entity  used  by  a  fund  as  a  regional
investment platform is a SPE.    In other words, the holding platform entity is:

(a)

established  solely
administering investee private companies;

for

the  purpose  of  holding  and

42

(b)

the  activities  of  the  holding  platform  entity  are  restricted  to
activities for the purpose in subparagraph (a) above.

The holding of assets, other than interests in investee private companies, is not
within the scope of activities permitted under the definition of SPE  in section
20AO(4).    Indeed,  the  assets  held  by  the  holding  platform  entity  have  to  be
investee private companies as defined in section 20AO(4).

Example 6

Limited  Partnership-F1,  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F1,  was  a  fund  as
defined  in  section  20AM.    Holding  Platform  Entity-HK,  a  private
company  resident  in  Hong  Kong,  was  wholly-owned  by  Limited
Partnership-F1.

Holding  Platform Entity-HK was operated  as a regional investment
platform  through  which  an  investment  return  was  generated  for
Limited  Partnership-F1  from  investee  private  companies  located  in
Asia-Pacific region including Hong Kong.

Investment Manager-HK, a specified person, was engaged to provide
services  in  Hong  Kong  to  Limited  Partnership-F1,  including:
monitoring  the  performance  of  the  investee  private  companies;
making  of  investment  decisions;  offering  advice  on  growth  of  the
portfolio; contracting to buy and sell the investee private companies.

Holding Platform Entity-HK held:

(a)

(b)

(c)

100%  of  the  share  capital  in  Company-HK  in  Hong  Kong,
through Company(SPE)-HK1;
100% of the share capital in Company-F2 in Jurisdiction-F2
through Company(SPE)-HK2;
100% of the share capital in Company-F3 in Jurisdiction-F3
through Company(SPE)-HK3;

Company-HK, Company-F2 and Company-F3 were investee private
companies carrying on business in Hong Kong, Jurisdiction-F2 and
Jurisdiction-F3 respectively.

43

Company(SPE)-HK1, Company(SPE)-HK2 and Company(SPE)-HK3
were  interposed  SPEs  incorporated  in  Hong  Kong  and  established
solely  for  the  purposes  of  holding  and  administering  Company-HK,
Company-F2 and Company-F3.

Tax treatment of Limited Partnership-F1, Holding Platform Entity-HK,
Investment  Manager-HK,  Company(SPE)-HK1,  Company(SPE)-
HK2 and Company(SPE)-HK3 would be as follows:

Limited Partnership-F1
Limited  Partnership-F1  would  be  exempt  from  payment  of  tax  as  a
fund  if  the  conditions  under  sections  20AN,  20AP  and  20AQ  were
satisfied.

Holding Platform Entity-HK
Holding  Platform  Entity-HK  operated  as  a  regional  investment
platform.    Since  it  was  structured  in  the  form  a  SPE,  Holding
Platform Entity-HK would be exempt from payment of tax as a SPE
under section 20AO(2) if the conditions under sections 20AN, 20AP
and 20AQ were satisfied.

Investment  Manager-HK  was  providing

Investment Manager-HK
investment
Since
management service to Limited Partnership-F1, it would be assessed
to profits tax in accordance with the principles in section 14.

Company(SPE)-HK1,  Company(SPE)-HK2  and  Company(SPE)-
HK3
Company(SPE)-HK1,  Company(SPE)-HK2  and  Company(SPE)-
HK3 would be exempt from payment of tax as interposed SPEs under
section  20AO(2)  if  the  conditions  under  sections  20AN,  20AP  and
20AQ were satisfied.

Investee private company

106.
In section 20AO(4), the term “investee private company” is defined to
mean a private company held by a SPE or an interposed SPE as a shareholder on
behalf of the fund.

44

The term “private company” in relation to the definition of “investee
107.
private  company”  has  the  same  meaning  given  by  section  20ACA(2).    That
means  a  company,  whether  incorporated  in  or  outside  Hong  Kong,  that  is  not
allowed  to  issue  any  invitations  to  the  public  to  subscribe  for  any  shares  or
debentures of the company.      In deciding whether a company is not allowed to
issue  invitations  to  the  public  to  subscribe  for  its  shares  or  debentures,  all
circumstances will be examined.    If the company is incorporated in Hong Kong,
the relevant provisions in the Companies Ordinance will be applied to determine
whether the company is a private company (i.e. whether it can issue invitations
to the public for capital).    If the company is incorporated outside Hong Kong,
provisions  in  overseas  legislation,  including  but  not  limiting  to  overseas
company  legislation,  will  be  applied  to  determine  whether  the  company  is
allowed to issue invitations to the public for capital.    If taking additional steps
or seeking approval would allow the company to issue invitations to the public
but without involving a substantial change to its nature, the company is treated
as not prohibited from issuing shares or debentures to the public.    In general,
neither  a  listed  company  nor  a  non-private  unlisted  company  (i.e.  a  public
company with more than 50 members) would be treated as a “private company”.

An investee private company is a private company in corporate form
108.
by definition.    Accordingly, the exemption for SPE in section 20AO applies to
specified securities of an investee private company in corporate form only and
not those of a non-corporate entity (e.g. partnership or trust).

Example 7

Fund-F1  was  a  private  equity  fund  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F1.    It
held  100%  of  the  share  capital  in  Company-F2  in  Jurisdiction-F2,
through  Company(SPE)-HK1  and  Company(SPE)-HK2,  which  were
both  Hong  Kong  incorporated  companies  without  any  trade  or
business activities in Hong Kong other than the holding of the share
capital in Company-F2.    Company(SPE)-HK1 held Company(SPE)-
HK2, which in turn held Company-F2.

Company(SPE)-HK1  was  a  SPE  and  Company(SPE)-HK2  was  an
interposed  SPE.    Company(SPE)-HK1,  Company(SPE)-HK2  and
Company-F2  were  the  “special  purpose  entity”,  “interposed  special
purpose  entity”  and  “investee  private  company”  respectively  as
defined  in  section  20AO(4).    Fund-F1  would  be  exempt  from  tax

45

under section 20AN(2) on profits derived from disposal of shares in
Company(SPE)-HK1  (i.e.  a  SPE).    Company(SPE)-HK1  would  be
exempt from payment of tax under section 20AO(2) on profits derived
from  disposal  of  shares  in  Company(SPE)-HK2  (i.e.  an  interposed
SPE).    Company(SPE)-HK2 would be exempt from payment of tax
under  section  20AO(2)  on  profits  derived  from  sale  of  shares  in
Company-F2 (i.e. an investee private company).

Example 8

Fund-HK was a private equity fund resident in Hong Kong.    It wholly
owned  Company-SPE  which  in  turn  formed  a  joint  venture  with
another investor to make investment in Company-F in Jurisdiction-F.

Company-SPE and Company-F fell respectively within the definitions
of “special purpose entity” and “investee private company” as defined
in  section  20AO(4).    Fund-HK  would  be  exempt  from  tax  under
section  20AN(2)  on  profits  derived  from  disposal  of  shares  in
Company-SPE (i.e. a SPE).    Company-SPE would be exempt from
payment  of  tax  under  section  20AO(2)  on  profits  derived  from
disposal of shares in Company-F (i.e. an investee private company).

Example 9

Fund-HK, resident in Hong Kong, fell within the definition of “fund”
in section 20AM.    Fund-F1, resident in Jurisdiction-F1, was a fund
which did not meet the definition of “fund” in section 20AM.    Fund-
HK  and  Fund-F1  respectively  owned  70%  and  30%  shares  in
Company-SPE  which  in  turn  made  investment  in  Company-F2  in
Jurisdiction-F2.    Company-F2 did not carry on any business in Hong
Kong.

Company-SPE fell within the definition of “special purpose entity” in
section 20AO(4).    Fund-HK would be exempt from tax under section
20AN(2) on profits derived from disposal of shares in Company-SPE
(i.e. a SPE) if the conditions in section 20AP or 20AQ are met.    Fund-
F1 would not be exempt from tax under section 20AN(2) on profits
derived from disposal of shares in Company-SPE (i.e. a SPE) because

46

Fund-F1 failed to meet the definition of “fund” under section 20AM.
However, Fund-F1 could receive exemption under section 20AC(2) as
a non-resident non-fund entity.

Company-SPE would be exempt from payment of tax under section
20AO(2) and (3) in respect of its 70% profits from the sale of shares
in Company-F2 (i.e. an investee private company).    Company-SPE
would also be exempt from payment of tax under section 20ACA(1)
in respect of its 30% profits from the sale of shares in Company-F2
(i.e. an excepted private company as defined in section 20ACA(2)).

Example 10

Fund-HK,  resident  in  Hong  Kong,  was  a  fund  falling  within  the
definition of “fund” in section 20AM.    It invested in the shares issued
by Investee Private Company-HK and Investee Private Company-F2,
incorporated in Hong Kong and Jurisdiction-F2 respectively, through
Company(SPE)-F1,  which  was
in
Jurisdiction-F1, without any trade or business activities in Hong Kong
other than the holding of Fund-HK’s investments.

incorporated  and  resident

Company(SPE)-F1,  Investee  Private  Company-HK  and  Investee

Private Company-F2 fell respectively within the meanings of “special

purpose entity” and “investee private company” in section 20AO(4).

Since Fund-HK was exempted from profits tax under section 20AN,

Company(SPE)-F1  would  also  be  exempt  from  profits  tax  under

section  20AO(2)  in  respect  of  its  profits  from  the  sale  of  the  two

investee private companies’ shares if the conditions in section 20AP

or 20AQ were met.    In deciding whether exemptions should be given

to Fund-HK and Company(SPE)-F1, the fact that the investee private

companies  were  or  were  not  carrying  on  business  in  Hong  Kong

(except the holding of immovable property in Hong Kong) would not

be of any relevance.

47

INVESTMENT IN PRIVATE COMPANIES

Transaction in shares of private company

109.
Private  companies  may  hold  any  type  of  assets  in  Hong  Kong.    In
order  to  reduce  the  risk  of  tax  evasion  by  funds  through  their  investment  in
private  companies,  sections  20AP  and  20AQ  specify  the  circumstances  under
which the profits tax exemption in sections 20AN and 20AO would not apply to
transactions carried out by a fund or a SPE in securities of, or issued by, a private
company.    The  term  “private  company”  has  the  meaning  given  by  section
20AO(4).    If a fund or a SPE (specified body) carries out transactions in shares,
stocks, debentures, loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes (specified securities) of, or
issued by, a private company (relevant company), the following factors will all
contribute to the end result of whether profits tax exemption under section 20AN
or 20AO is to be available to the specified body:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the relevant company holding or not holding, whether directly
or indirectly, immovable property (immovable property test);

the period of the relevant company’s specified securities being
held by the specified body (holding period test);

the  specified  body  having  or  not  having  control  over  the
relevant company (control test); and

the  level  of  short-term  assets  held  by  the  relevant  company
(short-term asset test).

The diagram at Appendix 3 shows how the above tests would operate in practice.
Sections 20AP and 20AQ deal with investment in specified securities of a private
company only and not those of a non-corporate entity such as partnership or trust.

Immovable property test

110.
The relevant company held by the specified body is not expected to
invest excessively in Hong Kong immovable property market.    The immovable
property  test  aims  to  prevent  the  relevant  company  from  converting  taxable

48

profits  derived  from  property  investment  into  non-taxable  income  via  a  fund
structure.    It is stipulated that the aggregate value of the immovable property
held  in  Hong  Kong  by  the  relevant  company  and  the  share  capital  (however
described)  in  another  private  company,  with  direct  or  indirect  holding  of
immovable  property  in  Hong  Kong,  cannot  exceed  10%  of  the  value  of  the
relevant company’s assets.    This 10% threshold in the immovable property test
is  not  new  and  has  been  adopted  for  “excepted  private  company”  in  section
20ACA(2).

If the 10% threshold in the immovable property test is exceeded, the
111.
specified body is not exempt from the payment of profits tax in respect of the
profits arising from transactions in specified securities.    If the 10% threshold in
the immovable property test is not exceeded, the specified body will be exempt
from tax if the holding period test, the control test and short-term asset test are
satisfied in good faith by the specified body.

In  case  the  relevant  company  does  not  hold,  whether  directly  or
112.
indirectly,  immovable  property  in  Hong  Kong  nor  share  capital  (however
described) in another company holding immovable property in Hong Kong, the
specified body will be exempt from tax if it satisfies the holding period test, the
control test and short-term asset test in good faith.    The words “in good faith”
are  intended  to  guard  against  notional  but  not  genuine  compliance  of  the
requirement.    Similar  wording  (i.e.  the  Latin  equivalent  “bona  fide”)  can  be
found  in  the  IRO,  such  as  section  26A(1A)(a)(ii)  (relating  to  profits  tax
exemption for publicly offered funds) and section 14G(1) (relating to profits tax
concessions  to  qualifying  aircraft  lessors  and  qualifying  aircraft  leasing
managers).

The term “immovable property” is widely defined in section 20AP(4)
113.
to  mean: land (whether covered by  water or  not); any  estate, right,  interest or
easement in or over any land; and things attached to land or permanently fastened
to anything attached to land, but does not include infrastructure.    In this context,
the  term  “infrastructure”  means  any  publicly  or  privately  owned  facility
providing or distributing services for the benefit of the public, and includes any
water, sewage, energy, fuel, transportation or communication facility.

The  term  “share  capital  (however  described)”  covers  all  forms  of
114.
participation interests or equity interests which entitle the holders to participate

49

in  or  share  profits  accrued  to  the  relevant  company,  with  or  without  a  share
capital.

115.
The “value of its assets” refers to the “market value” of the relevant
company’s  assets.    In  calculating  the  value  of  the  total  assets  of  the  relevant
company, debts of the company including liabilities secured by mortgages on the
relevant  immovable  property  are  not  deducted.    Thus  the  values  used  in  the
percentage calculation are in gross amount.

When  applying  the  10%  threshold,  it  is  necessary  to  examine  the
116.
audited  financial  statements  of  the  relevant  company  for  the  latest  year,
supplemented by management accounts up to the date of transaction in securities,
to determine:

(a)

(b)

 the  market  value  of  the  holding  of  immovable  property  in
Hong Kong;

 the  market  value  of  the  holding  of  share  capital  in  another
private company with direct or indirect holding of immovable
property in Hong Kong; and

(c)

 the market value of the assets of the relevant company.

117.
Due to price fluctuation, the value of immovable properties held by
the relevant company may exceed 10% of its assets at one time and fall below
10%  at  another  time  during  the  year  of  assessment.    If  a  fund  invests  in  the
relevant  company  with  immovable  property  assets,  there  is  concern  at  which
point  in  time  the  immovable  property  test  would  be  applied  to  determine  the
fund’s eligibility for tax exemption under section 20AN and whether the fund
needs to keep track of the value of the immovable properties held by the relevant
company.    Generally,  it  may  not  be  necessary  to  obtain  a  valuation  of  the
underlying immovable properties since the fund might not be able to request a
valuation of the immovable properties.    A snapshot at the time of transaction of
the relevant company’s assets would be taken.    The eligibility for tax exemption
would then be assessed according to the proportion of the immovable properties’
value over the relevant company’s assets.

50

Holding period test

The holding period test is targeted at encouraging funds to focus on
118.
the long-term prospects of the investee private companies.    The two-year period
under  the  holding  period  test  is  drawn  up  having  regard  to  the  genuine
operational needs of private equity funds.

119. If the relevant company does not hold, whether directly or indirectly, any
immovable property in Hong Kong, or holds, whether directly or indirectly, not
more  than  10%  of  its  assets  in  immovable  property  in  Hong  Kong  and  the
investment in the relevant company has been held by the specified body for at
least two years (whether or not the specified body has control over the relevant
company), the specified body will not be taxed on the profits arising from the
transaction  in  securities  in  the  relevant  company.    If  the  relevant  company
has been held by the specified body for less than two years, the control test and
the short-term asset test will apply.

In section 20AP(3) and section 20AQ(3), the term “transaction” refers
120.
to  the  disposal  of  securities  of  the  relevant  company  whereas  the  expression
“series of transactions” will be interpreted in line with section 50AAI of the IRO.
The two-year period counts from the date when the specified body acquired the
specified securities of the relevant company.

Control test and short-term asset test

The control test and the short-term asset test are to reduce the risk of
121.
tax  abuse  by  engaging  in  trading  activities  (i.e.  transacting  in  trading  assets)
through sales of specified securities in private companies.

If  the  two-year  holding  period  test  cannot  be  satisfied,  profits  tax

122.
exemption would only be provided under the following conditions:

(a)

(b)

the  specified  body  does  not  have  a  controlling  stake  in  the
relevant company; or

the  specified  body  has  a  controlling  stake  in  the  relevant
company, but the relevant company does not hold more than
50% of the value of the relevant company’s  assets in short-
term assets.

51

The  word  “control”  is  defined  in  section  20AN(6)  and  means,  in
123.
relation to a corporation, the power of a person to secure: by means of the holding
of shares or the possession of voting power in or in relation to the corporation or
any  other corporation;  or by  virtue of any powers conferred  by the  articles of
association or other document regulating the corporation or any other corporation,
that the affairs of the corporation are conducted in accordance with the wishes of
the person.    A controlling interest in a private company normally refers to over
50%  ownership  interest.    In  relation  to  a  partnership,  “control”  means,  the
power  of  a  person  to  secure:  by  means  of  the  holding  of  interests  or  the
possession  of  voting  power  in  or  in  relation  to  the  partnership  or  any  other
partnership; or by virtue of any powers conferred by the partnership agreement
or other document regulating the partnership or any other partnership, that the
affairs  of  the  corporation  are  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  wishes  of  the
person.

124.
term asset” is defined in section 20AP(4) to mean an asset:

In relation to the specified securities of the relevant company, “short-

(a)

that is of a class not specified in Schedule 16C;

(b)

that is not immovable property in Hong Kong; and

(c)

that has been held by the company for less than 3 consecutive
years before the date of disposal of the specified securities.

In  this  context,  a  short-term  asset  is  not  limited  to  the  asset  held  in
125.
Hong Kong.    The “3 consecutive years before the date of disposal” requirement
counts  backward  from  the  date  when  the  specified  securities  of  the  relevant
company are being disposed of by a fund, whether or not through a SPE.

Example 11

Fund-HK,  resident  in  Hong  Kong,  was  a  fund  falling  within  the
definition  of  “fund”  in  section  20AM.    On  1 April  2019,  Fund-HK
acquired  51%  of  the  shares  in  Private  Company-HK,  which  was
incorporated and carrying on business in Hong Kong without holding
any  immovable  properties  in  Hong  Kong.    The  value  of  short-term
assets  of  Private  Company-HK  did  not  exceed  50%  of  the  value  of

52

Private Company-HK’s assets.    On 1 June 2019, Fund-HK disposed
2% of the shares in Private Company-HK.    On 2 July 2019, Fund-
HK further disposed 49% of the shares in Private Company-HK.

Fund-HK was exempt from payment of tax in respect of its assessable
profits derived from transactions in  the shares of Private Company-
HK because the value of Private Company-HK’s short-term assets did
not exceed 50% of the value of Private Company-HK’s assets though
Fund-HK disposed of the shares in Private Company-HK less than two
years after acquisition and had control over Private Company-HK.

Example 12

Listed/ unlisted securities

Depending on the market conditions, a fund may sell its investment in
126.
an investee private company to another strategic investor or to the public through
an initial public offering (IPO).    If the fund sells its investment in the investee
private company through an IPO, it is in substance no different from a transaction
in listed securities or a transaction in securities of an investee private company.
That is, the fund will continue to be eligible for profits tax exemption in respect
of the divestment if the exemption conditions in section 20AN remain satisfied.
Conversely, if a listed company after privatisation is sold as an investee private
company, the fund will continue to be exempt from profits tax provided the same
exemption conditions have been fulfilled.    The extent of exemption for a SPE
is the percentage of the tax-exempted fund’s ownership of the SPE in the year of
assessment.    It  is  recognized  that  a  SPE  may  be  required  to  hold  certain
percentage  of  the  securities  of  an  investee  private  company  for  a  reasonable
period of time after IPO.    If the SPE does not commence to carry on any trade
or activities other than the holding of investments in investee private companies,
including listed securities converted from the SPE’s previous interests in investee
private company after IPO, the Commissioner would continue to accept that the
SPE remains a SPE.

ITVF SCHEME

Profits tax exemption for investment co-invested in private companies
127.
by the ITVFC and the partner funds remains the status quo.    Given that the co-
investment  is  subject  to  the  control  and  monitoring  of  the  Information  and
Technology Commission (including that the investee companies have to meet the
criteria  for  “Eligible  Local  Innovation  and Technology  Start-up”  of  the  ITVF
Scheme), section 20AR specifies that the co-investment transactions do not need
to be subject to the tests in sections 20AP and 20AQ (i.e. immovable property
test, holding period test, control test and short-term asset test).    Yet, investment
in private companies by the partner funds on their own (i.e. not co-investment
with the ITVFC) will be subject to the four tests.    The IRO does not prevent the
use  of  a  SPE  in  a  co-investment  by  a  partner  fund  of  the  ITVF  Scheme.
However,  a  transaction  in  shares  of  a  SPE  held  by  a  partner  fund  is  not  a
transaction in assets of Class 11 specified in Schedule 16C.

OPEN-ENDED FUND COMPANY

Tax treatments for non-qualifying transactions

128.
Section 20AS, replicated from the provisions in the repealed section
20AH(7),  provides  for  the  disapplication  of  profits  tax  exemption  to  an  OFC.
Despite that an OFC may enjoy profits tax exemption on transactions in assets
of a non-Schedule 16C class pursuant to section 20AN(2)(c), if an OFC meeting
the definition of “fund” in section 20AM13  engages in direct trading or direct
business undertaking in Hong Kong in assets of a non-Schedule 16C class, or
utilizes assets of a non-Schedule 16C class to generate income, it will be assessed
to profits tax in respect of its assessable profits earned from the trading, business
undertaking or utilization.    Since the mode of operation of each OFC differs, it
would be difficult to specify in the IRO the types of non-qualifying transactions
carried out by OFCs, and how the assets of a non-Schedule 16C class would be
used for direct trading or direct business undertaking.    Transactions in assets of
a  non-Schedule  16C  class  of  an  OFC  and  incidental  transactions  would  not

13

A publicly offered or privately offered OFC is not allowed to be a business undertaking for general
commercial  or  industrial  purposes.    See  Chapter  7  of  the  SFC  Handbook  for  Unit  Trusts  and
Mutual Funds and Chapter 11 of the OFC Code.    Therefore, an OFC would generally be accepted
as a fund under section 20AM for the purposes of tax exemption.

55

qualify for profits tax exemption if such transactions relate to assets which are
normally purchased and sold in the normal course of business of a commercial
or industrial enterprise, in particular those mentioned in section 20AM(7), and
the  OFC  constitutes  as  a  business  undertaking  for  general  commercial  or
industrial purposes.    In any event, an OFC would not be assessed to profits tax
in respect of any offshore profits or capital gains, whether relating to assets of a
class specified in Schedule 16C or not.

Sub-funds of OFC

129.
An OFC may be created as an umbrella fund meaning that the OFC
could  consist  of  a  number  of  separately  pooled  sub-funds  and  each  sub-fund
would have a pool of assets that is managed in accordance with the investment
objectives  and  policies  for  that  particular  sub-fund.    Operationally,  each  sub-
fund would also be distinct.    Per section 20AT, replicated from the provisions
in the repealed section 20AG, if the instrument of incorporation of an OFC (i.e.
the main company) provides for the division of its scheme property (as defined
by section 112A of the SFO) into separate parts (each of which is a sub-fund),
then when applying section 14 to the main company:

(a)

a reference to assessable profits in section 14 is a reference to
the total of the assessable profits of all of its sub-funds; and

(b)

 for computing the assessable profits of the sub-funds–

(i)

each sub-fund is to be regarded as an OFC;

(ii)

the main company is to be regarded as not being an OFC;
and

(iii)  the provisions of Part 4 of the IRO apply to a sub-fund

as if it were an OFC.

Tax exemption should be allowed to each sub-fund separately as long
130.
as each sub-fund meets the exemption conditions as set out in section 20AN.    If
the condition for exemption from payment of tax under section 20AN is met in
respect of a sub-fund, the sub-fund is exempt from tax under that section even if
the  condition  is  not  met  in  respect  of  another  sub-fund  of  the  main  company.

56

As a matter of symmetry, any loss sustained by a sub-fund is not available for set
off against any assessable profits of another sub-fund of the main company.

131.
Since a sub-fund is not a legal person, section 20AT(3) provides that
a main company will be liable for the profits tax attributable to each of its sub-
funds.    The tax liability of the main company  is the aggregate amount of tax
liability on each sub-fund’s profits.    Having regard to the segregated liability of
sub-funds  as  mentioned  in  section  112S  of  the  SFO,  any  profits  tax  liability
attributable to a sub-fund must only be discharged out of the assets of the sub-
fund.    In other words, the assets of a sub-fund must not be used to discharge the
liabilities under the IRO of the main company or any other sub-fund, and any
liability incurred on behalf of a sub-fund may only be discharged out of its assets.

The main company being a legal person has to bear the legal obligation
132.
of  complying  with  the  provisions  of  the  IRO  on  reporting  chargeability,
lodgement  of  returns,  providing  information,  lodgement  of  objections  and
appeals, payment of tax, etc.    Penalties and offences under Part 14 of the IRO
would be imposed on the main company for failures to comply with the relevant
statutory  provisions.    In  case  any  liabilities  (e.g.  penalties  for  late  filing  of
returns) are not attributable to any particular sub-fund, the main company may
allocate any liabilities between its sub-funds in a manner that it considers as fair
to its shareholders according to section 112S(5) of the SFO.

LOSS TREATMENTS

Losses sustained by funds (other than OFC) and SPE

 The loss treatment under section 20AU is the same as that set out in
133.
section  20AD.    As  a  rule,  losses  sustained  by  a  fund  other  than  an  OFC  in
respect of its qualifying transactions and incidental transactions are not available
for set off against any of its assessable profits for the year of assessment or any
subsequent  year  of  assessment.    Likewise,  losses  sustained  by  a  SPE  from
qualifying transactions and incidental transactions in specified securities and the
related  rights,  options  or  interests  in  an  investee  private  company  or  an
interposed SPE in a year of assessment are not available for set off against any
of  its  assessable  profits  for  the  year  of  assessment  or  any  subsequent  year  of
assessment.

57

Losses sustained by OFC

The loss treatment under section 20AV is the same as that set out in
134.
the repealed section 20AL(1) and (3).    As a rule, losses sustained by an OFC
from qualifying transactions, incidental transactions or transactions in assets of
a  non-Schedule  16C  class  per  section  20AN(2)(a),  (b)  and  (c)  in  a  year  of
assessment are not available for set off against any of its assessable profits for
the  year  of  assessment  or  any  subsequent  year  of  assessment.    In  addition,
losses sustained by an  OFC from a specified  activity, profits of which are not
tax-exempted, in a year of assessment are only available for set off against any
of  its  assessable  profits  earned  from  the  specified  activity  for  the  year  of
assessment  or  any  subsequent  year  of  assessment.    Specified  activity  in  this
context  means  a  transaction,  a  direct  trading,  a  direct  business  undertaking  or
utilization of assets in a non-Schedule 16C class.

ANTI-ROUND TRIPPING PROVISIONS

Resident person with not less than 30% interest

135.
The  anti-round  tripping  provisions  under  sections  20AX  and  20AY,
same as those set out in sections 20AE and 20AF, are to prevent abuse or round-
tripping  by  resident  persons  to  take  advantage  of  the  profits  tax  exemption.
Section 20AY also prevents booking of profits in SPEs without distributing to
the fund.

136.
If a resident person, either alone or jointly with the person’s associates,
holds a beneficial interest (whether direct or indirect or both) of not less than
30% in a fund with profits exempted under section 20AN, or any percentage if
the fund is the resident person’s associate, the resident person is deemed under
section 20AX to have derived assessable profits in respect of the profits earned
by the fund from the qualifying transactions and incidental transactions carried
out in Hong Kong.    Where the fund has a beneficial interest (whether direct or
indirect or both) in a SPE that is exempt from the payment of tax in respect of its
assessable  profits  from  transactions  falling  within  section  20AO,  the  resident
person  is  deemed  under  section  20AY  to  have  derived  assessable  profits  in
respect of the profits earned by the SPE.

58

The  provisions  in  sections  20AX  and  20AY  apply  in  any  year  of

137.
assessment commencing on or after 1 April 2019.

Resident person / non-resident person

Definition of residence

Section 20AW sets out the definitions of “resident person” and “non-
138.
resident person” for the purposes of sections 20AX and 20AY and Schedules 15C
and 15D.      In determining the residency for sections 20AX and 20AY, different
legal  tests  are  prescribed  for  individuals  and  non-individual  entities  which
include corporations, partnerships and trustees of trust estates.    By definition, a
non-resident person is a person who is not a resident person.

Individuals

In  relation  to  a  year  of  assessment,  an  individual  is  regarded  as  a
139.
resident person if the individual ordinarily resides in Hong Kong in that year of
assessment, or stays in Hong Kong for a period or a number of periods amounting
to more than 180 days during that year of assessment or more than 300 days in
two  consecutive  years  of  assessment  one  of  which  is  that  year  of  assessment.
These provisions are the same as those under section 41 of the IRO relating to
the  concepts  “ordinarily  resident”  and  “temporary  resident”  which  qualify  an
individual for election for personal assessment.

For  the  purpose  of  determining  an  individual’s  residency,  it  is
140.
generally considered that an individual “ordinarily resides” in Hong Kong if the
individual  has  a  permanent  home  in  Hong  Kong  where  the  individual  or  the
individual’s family lives.    The mere fact that an individual holds a Hong Kong
identity card is inconclusive in showing that the individual ordinarily resides in
Hong  Kong.    In  this  respect,  the  Board  of  Review  in  its  decision  D57/02,
IRBRD vol 17, 829 applied the test adopted by the Court of Appeal in Director
of  Immigration  v  Ng  Shun-loi  to  decide  whether  an  individual  was  ordinarily
resident in Hong Kong:

“The  Hong  Kong  Court  of Appeal  has  defined  the  term  ‘ordinarily
resident’ in Director of Immigration v Ng Shun-loi [1987] HKLR 798,
per Hunter J:

59

‘The  words  “ordinarily  resident”  mean  that  the  person  must  be
habitually  and  normally  resident  here  apart  from  temporary  or
occasional absences of long or short duration’ (Levene v. IRC [1928]
AC 217 applied).

‘A  person  is  resident  where  he  resides.  …  When  is  he  ordinarily
resident?    I think that is when he resides there in the ordinary way.
That must be the meaning of the adverb.    The expression is therefore
contemplating  residence  for  the  purposes  of  everyday  life.    It  is
residence in the place where a person lives and conducts his daily life
in circumstances which lead to the conclusion that he is living there
as  an  ordinary  member  of  the  community  would  live  for  all  the
purposes of his daily life’ (R v. Barnet London Borough Council, ex
parte Nilish Shah [1982] 1 QB 688 applied).”

141.
In ascertaining the number of days an individual stays in Hong Kong,
part of a day will be counted as one day.    This practice is consistently adopted
in applying the 60-day rule under salaries tax in section 8(1B), in deciding the
eligibility for election for personal assessment and in determining residency for
tax treaty purposes.

Non-individual entities

142.
 Non-individual entities, which include corporations, partnerships and
trustees of trust estates, are subject to the same legal test in determining whether
they are resident persons.    In relation to a year of assessment, a corporation, a
partnership or a trustee of a trust estate is regarded as a resident person if the
central management and control of the corporation, partnership or trust estate is
exercised in Hong Kong in that year of assessment.

Central management and control

143.
The  “central  management  and  control”  test  is  a  well-established
common law rule adopted in many jurisdictions, such as the UK, Australia and
Singapore, in determining the residence of a company and other non-individual
entities.    The common law rule was enunciated by Lord Loreburn in De Beers
Consolidated Mines, Limited v Howe 5 TC 198 at page 213:

60

“…  a  company  resides,  for  purposes  of  Income  Tax,  where  its  real
business is carried on.  … I regard that as the true rule; and the real
business  is  carried  on  where  the  central  management  and  control
actually abides.”

The  central  management  and  control  refers  to  the  highest  level  of
144.
control  of  the  business  of  a  company  or  an  entity.    The  exercise  of  central
management  and  control  does  not  necessarily  require  any  active  involvement.
The  place  where  the  central  management  and  control  is  exercised  is  not
necessarily the place where the main operations of the business are to be found,
though the two places may often coincide.    Further, the place of incorporation
of a company or the place of establishment of an entity is not in itself conclusive
of  the  place  where  the  central  management  and  control  is  exercised,  and  is
therefore not conclusive of the place where the company or entity is resident per
the judgment in Todd v Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Co. Ltd., 14 TC 119.

The location of central management and control is wholly a question
145.
of fact.    Each case must be decided on its own facts.    Factors that are decisive
in  one  case  may  carry  little  weight  in  another.    In  general,  if  the  central
management  and  control  of  a  company  is  exercised  by  the  directors  in  board
meetings or by the partners in partners’ meetings, the relevant locality is where
those meetings are held.    In many cases, the directors or partners meet in the
jurisdiction where the business operations take place, and central management
and  control  is  clearly  located  in  that  jurisdiction.    In  other  cases,  central
management  and  control  may  be  exercised  by  directors  or  partners  in  one
jurisdiction though the actual business operations may take place elsewhere.    It
should be noted that the residence of individual directors or partners is generally
not relevant in determining the locality of the central management and control of
a  company  or  partnership.    Therefore,  the  mere  fact  that  the  majority  of  the
directors of a company or partners of a partnership are resident in Hong Kong
does not of itself mean that the company or partnership is centrally managed and
controlled in Hong Kong, and hence would not adversely affect the application
of the tax exemption.

The  place  of  board  meetings  or  partners’  meetings  also  is  not
146.
necessarily  conclusive.    It  is  significant  only  in  so  far  as  those  meetings
constitute  the  medium  through  which  central  management  and  control  is
exercised.    In cases where central management and control of a company or a

61

partnership  is  in  fact  exercised  by  an  individual  (e.g.  the  board  chairman,  the
managing director or general partner), the relevant locality is the place where the
  As  central
controlling
management  and  control  is  a  question  of  fact  and  reality,  when  reaching  a
conclusion in accordance with the case law principles, only factors which exist
for genuine commercial reasons will be accepted.

the

Beneficial interest

Definition of beneficial interest

Section 20AW sets out the definitions of “direct beneficial interest”
147.
and “indirect beneficial interest” for the purposes of sections 20AX and 20AY
and Schedules 15C and 15D.

Direct beneficial interest

148.
Section 20AW(4) provides that a person is to be regarded as having a
direct beneficial interest in a corporation, a partnership, a trustee of a trust estate
or any other entity if:

(a)

(b)

the  person  holds  any  of  the  issued  share  capital  (however
described) of the corporation (where the corporation is not a
trustee of a trust estate);

the person, as a partner in the partnership, is entitled to any of
the profits of the partnership (where the partnership is not a
trustee of a trust estate);

(c)

the person, otherwise than through another person－

(i)  benefits under the trust estate; or

(ii)  not being a trustee of the trust estate (or a director of the
trustee  where  the  trustee  is  a  corporation),  is  able  or
might reasonably be expected to be able to control the
activities  of  the  trust  estate  or  the  application  of  its
corpus (i.e. capital) or income; or

62

(d)

the  person  has  any  of  the  ownership  interests  in  the  entity
which is not a corporation, a partnership and a trustee of a trust
estate.

149.
Section  20AW(8)  provides  that  if  a  partner  is  not  entitled  to  the
partnership’s profits but entitled to a distribution of the partnership’s assets upon
its dissolution, a reference to the entitlement to the partnership’s profits is to be
construed according to section 20AW(8) as a reference to the entitlement to a
distribution of the partnership’s assets upon its dissolution.

150.
Section 20AW(9) provides that the reference to the issued share capital
of a corporation does not include the shares comprised in the issued share capital
of the corporation that do not entitle the holders to receive dividends, whether in
cash or in kind, and a distribution of the corporation’s assets upon its dissolution
other  than  a  return  of  capital.    Thus,  when  computing  the  percentage  of  the
issued  share  capital  of  the  corporation  held  by  a  fund  manager,  non-profit
participating shares held by the fund manager for the sole purpose of managing
a fund corporation are excluded.

Example 13

Mutual  Fund  Corp-F,  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F,  had  issued  10,000
shares, out of which 500 were “management shares” and holders were
entitled
to  special  management  rights  but  not  dividends  or
distributions  of  assets  upon  dissolution.    Fund  Management  Corp-
HK,  a  fund  management  company  resident  in  Hong  Kong,  was
appointed  as  the  fund  manager  of  Mutual  Fund  Corp-F.    Fund
Management Corp-HK was allotted the 500 management shares and
it further acquired 1,500 shares issued by Mutual Fund Corp-F.

The extent of Fund Management Corp-HK’s direct beneficial interest
in Mutual Fund Corp-F was computed as 1,500  ÷  (10,000 – 500) =
15.79%.    The 500 management shares were excluded in ascertaining
Fund  Management  Corp-HK’s  beneficial  interest  in  Mutual  Fund
Corp-F.

63

Indirect beneficial interest

Section 20AW(5) provides that a person is to be regarded as having an
151.
indirect  beneficial  interest  in  a  corporation,  a  partnership,  a  trustee  of  a  trust
estate or any other entity (the other person) if, through a third person (interposed
person)  or  through  a  series  of  two  or  more  interposed  persons,  who  is  or  are
related to the person and the other person in the way described in section 20AW(6)
and (7):

(a)

(b)

the  person is  interested  in  any  of  the  issued  share  capital
(however  described)  of
the
corporation is not a trustee of a trust estate);

the  corporation

(where

the person is entitled to any of the profits of th e partnership
(where the partnership is not a trustee of a trust estate);

(c)

the person–

(i)  benefits under the trust estate; or

(ii)  not being a trustee of the trust estate (or a director of the
trustee  where  the  trustee  is  a  corporation),  is  able  (or
might reasonably be expected to be able) to control the
activities  of  the  trust  estate  or  the  application  of  its
corpus or income; or

(d)

the  person  has  any  of  the  ownership  interests  in  the  entity
which is not a corporation, a partnership and a trustee of a trust
estate.

Section 20AW(6) provides that if there is one interposed person, the
152.
person has a direct beneficial interest in the interposed person and the interposed
person  has  a  direct  beneficial  interest  in  the  other  person.    Section  20AW(7)
further provides that if there is a series of two or more interposed persons, the
person has a direct beneficial interest in the first interposed person in the series;
each interposed person (other than the last interposed person) in the series has a
direct beneficial interest in the next interposed person in the series; and the last
interposed person in the series has a direct beneficial interest in the other person.

64

Control of a trust estate

A  person  who  has  the  control  of  the  activities  of  a  trust  estate  can
153.
distribute the trust estate’s income or asset according to the person’s discretion
and  to  whomever  the  person  chooses  including  himself.    To  counteract
opportunities for tax-avoidance, a resident person who has a direct  or indirect
beneficial  interest  in  a  trustee  of  a  trust  estate  by  reason  of  the  fact  that  the
resident person is able or might reasonably be expected to be able to control the
activities of the trust estate or the application of its corpus or income, is to be
regarded  as  being  interested  in  100%  in  value  of  the  trust  estate  per  sections
20AX(5) and 20AY(4).

Associate

In  administering  the  anti-round  tripping  provisions  under  sections
154.
20AX  and  20AY,  provisions  on  “associate”  are  required  to  prevent  resident
persons from circumventing these provisions by holding beneficial interests in
funds through associates.    Under section 20AX(2), beneficial interests in a fund
held by a resident person’s associates, resident or non-resident, will be taken into
account in determining whether the “not less than 30%” threshold is exceeded.
Besides, in the case where a resident person holds a beneficial interest in a fund
which is the resident person’s associate, the anti-round tripping provisions will
apply, per sections 20AX(3) and 20AY(2), in respect of any percentage of the
resident person’s beneficial interest in the fund.

Specific provisions on “associate” apply where the resident person is
155.
a natural person, a corporation or a partnership.    Broadly speaking, in respect
of a resident person who is a natural person, “associate” generally includes the
person’s  “relative”,  the  person’s  partner  and  a  corporation  controlled  by  the
person.    In  respect  of  a  resident  person  which  is  a  corporation,  “associate”
generally  includes  its  “associated  corporation”,  which  is  defined  to  mean  a
corporation over which the resident corporation has control, a corporation which
has  control  over  the  resident  corporation,  or  a  corporation  which  is  under  the
control of the same person as is the resident corporation.    In respect of a resident
person which is a partnership, “associate” generally includes a partner in and a
corporation controlled by the resident partnership.    The definition of “associate”
in section 20AN(6) covers the following persons:

65

(a)

(b)

if it is a corporation, a partnership in which the corporation is
a partner; and

if  it  is  a  partnership,  an  “associated  partnership”  of  the
partnership.

156.
The term “associated  partnership” is defined to  mean:  a partnership
over which the resident partnership has control; a partnership which has control
over the resident partnership; or a partnership which is under the control of the
same person as is the resident partnership.

157.
For the purposes of sections 20AX and 20AY, where a resident person
holds beneficial interest in a fund which is a partnership, the Commissioner takes
the position that the mere fact that the resident person is a partner in the fund and
the other partners in the fund are fellow partners of the resident person would not
render  the  fund  or  the  other  partners  in  the  fund  “associates”  of  the  resident
person.

Ascertainment of deemed profits

158.
The amount of the assessable profits deemed under section 20AX to
have been derived by a resident person for a year of assessment commencing on
or  after  1 April  2019  is  ascertained  in  accordance  with  Schedule  15C.    The
amount  of  the  assessable  profits  deemed  under  section  20AY  to  have  been
derived by a resident person for a year of assessment commencing on or after 1
April 2019 is ascertained in accordance with Schedule 15D.

159.
The amount of deemed assessable profits under section 20AX is the
total sum arrived at by adding up the amount ascertained in accordance with the
formula in section 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 15C for each day in the period in the
year of assessment during which the resident person has the following percentage
of direct or indirect beneficial interest in the fund:

(a)

alone or jointly with the resident person’s associates, not less
than 30%; or

(b)

any percentage if the fund is the resident person’s associate.

66

The amount of deemed assessable profits under section 20AY is the
160.
total sum arrived at by adding up the amount ascertained in accordance with the
formula in section 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 15D for each day in the period in the
year of assessment during which the resident person has the following percentage
of indirect beneficial interest in the SPE:

(a)

alone or jointly with the resident person’s associates, not less
than 30%; or

(b)

any percentage if the fund is the resident person’s associate.

Section 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 15C sets out the following formula in
161.
ascertaining the amount of deemed assessable profits, out of the exempt profits
of a fund, of the resident person for a particular day in a year of assessment:

A

=

B    ×    C

D

where–  A   means the exempt profits of the fund for a particular day

in a year of assessment

B  means the extent of the resident person’s beneficial interest
in the fund on the particular day, expressed as a percentage
determined in accordance with Part 2 of Schedule 15C

C  means  the  exempt  profits  of  the  fund  for  the  accounting

period in which the particular day falls

D  means the total number of days in the accounting period of

the fund in which the particular day falls

 In section 1 of Part 2 of Schedule 15C, the extent of a resident person’s

162.
direct beneficial interest in the fund is determined as follows:

(a)

the percentage of the issued share capital (however described)
of the corporation held by the resident person (if the fund is a
corporation that is not a trustee of a trust estate);

(b)

the percentage of the profits of the partnership to which the

67

resident person is entitled (if the fund is a partnership that is
not a trustee of a trust estate);

the percentage in value of the trust estate in which the resident
person is interested (if the fund is a trustee of a trust estate);
or

the percentage of ownership interests that the resident person
has  in  the  entity  (if  the  fund  is  an  entity  that  is  not  a
corporation, a partnership or a trustee of a trust estate).

(c)

(d)

163.

 In section 2 of Part 2 of Schedule 15C, the extent of a resident person’s

indirect beneficial interest in the fund is determined as follows:

(a)

(b)

if there is one interposed person – the percentage arrived at by
multiplying the percentage of the resident person’s beneficial
interest  in  the  interposed  person  by  the  percentage  of  the
interposed person’s beneficial interest in the fund; or

if  there  is  a  series  of  two  or  more  interposed  persons  –  the
percentage  arrived  at  by  multiplying  the  percentage  of  the
resident  person’s  beneficial  interest  in  the  first  interposed
person in the series by the percentage of the beneficial interest
of  each  interposed  person  (other  than  the  last  interposed
person) in the series in the next interposed person in the series
and  the  percentage  of  the  beneficial  interest  of  the  last
interposed person in the series in the fund.

164.
Section 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 15D sets out the following formula in
ascertaining the amount of deemed assessable profits, out of the exempt profits
of a SPE, of the resident person for a particular day in a year of assessment:

A

=

B1  ×  B2  ×  C

D

where–  A   means the exempt profits of the SPE for a particular day

in a year of assessment

68

B1  means  the  extent  of  the  resident  person’s  beneficial
interest in the fund on the particular day, expressed as a
percentage  determined  in  accordance  with  Part  2  of
Schedule 15C

B2  means the extent  of the fund’s beneficial  interest  in the
SPE  on  the  particular  day,  expressed  as  a  percentage
determined in accordance with Part 2 of Schedule 15D
C  means the exempt profits of the SPE for the accounting

period of the SPE in which the particular day falls

D  means the total number of days in the accounting period

of the SPE in which the particular day falls

Section 1 of Part 2 of Schedule 15D provides that the extent of a fund’s

165.
direct beneficial interest in the SPE is determined as follows:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

 the percentage of the issued share capital (however described)
a
of the corporation held by the fund ( if
corporation that is not a trustee of a trust estate);

the  SPE

is

the percentage of the profits of the partnership to which the
fund is entitled   (if the SPE is a partnership that is not a trustee
of a trust estate);

the percentage in value of the trust estate in which the fund is
interested ( if the SPE is a trustee of a trust estate); or

the percentage of ownership interests that the fund has in the
entity ( if  the  SPE  is  not  a  corporation,  a  partnership  or  a
trustee of a trust estate).

A fund has an indirect beneficial interest in a SPE, if it has a direct
166.
beneficial interest in the first interposed person and the first interposed person
has a direct beneficial interest in the next interposed person in the series and so
on, and the last interposed person in the series has a direct beneficial interest in
the SPE.

167.
beneficial interest in the SPE is determined as follows:

 In section 2 of Part 2 of Schedule 15D, the extent of a fund’s indirect

69

(a)

(b)

if there is one interposed person – the percentage arrived at by
multiplying the percentage of the fund’s beneficial interest in
the  interposed  person  by  the  percentage  of  the  interposed
person’s beneficial interest in the SPE; or

if  there  is  a  series  of  2  or  more  interposed  persons  –  the
percentage  arrived  at  by  multiplying  the  percentage  of  the
fund’s beneficial interest in the first interposed person in the
series  by  the  percentage  of  the  beneficial  interest  of  each
interposed person (other than the last interposed person) in the
series  in  the  next  interposed  person  in  the  series  and  the
percentage  of  the  beneficial  interest  of  the  last  interposed
person in the series in the SPE.

No deemed loss for resident persons

The  anti-round  tripping  provisions  are  intended  disincentives  to  a
168.
resident person for taking advantage of the profits tax exemption by carrying out
round-tripping.    In this regard, the anti-round tripping provisions only impose
deemed profits but not losses on a resident person.    A resident person, therefore,
will not be entitled to claim any proportionate amount of the losses sustained by
a fund or a SPE in which the resident person holds a beneficial interest.

A resident person may sustain losses in other businesses carried on in
169.
Hong Kong for the relevant year of assessment.    Section 20AX provides that
the deemed assessable profits “are to be regarded as the assessable profits arising
in, or derived from, Hong Kong of the resident person for the year of assessment
from a trade, profession or business carried on by the resident person in Hong
Kong.”    Whether a resident person can set off the deemed assessable profits,
like  those  derived  from  a  normal  trade,  profession  or  business,  by  losses
sustained  in  other  businesses  of  the  resident  person  in  accordance  with  the
provisions of section 19C depends on the status of the resident person.    In the
case of a resident corporation, the set-off is allowable.    In the case of a resident
individual or resident partnership, the set-off is not allowable, unless the holding
of the beneficial interest in the fund is part and parcel of the other business of the
resident  person.    The  individual  or  partners  of  the  partnership  can,  however,
obtain the set-off under personal assessment, if applicable.

70

Provisions not applicable if bona fide widely held

Sections  20AX(8) and 20AY(7) provide that the anti-round tripping
170.
provisions do not apply to a resident person if the Commissioner is satisfied that
beneficial  interests  in  the  fund  concerned  are  bona  fide  widely  held.    These
subsections  are  meant  to  be  an  escape  route  in  case  a  resident  person
unintentionally  holds  a  beneficial  interest  above  the  prescribed  threshold  in  a
fund that is bona fide widely held by investors.

The term “bona fide widely held” in sections 20AX(8) and 20AY(7)
171.
has also been adopted in sections 20AE(8) and 26A(1A) of the IRO.    Likewise,
the term “bona fide widely held” would be consistently interpreted as follows:

(a)

(b)

 during the year of assessment in question, at no time did fewer
than 50 persons hold (or have the right to become the holders
of) all of the units, shares or interests in the fund; and

 at no time during the year did fewer than 21 persons hold (or
have the right to become the holders of) units or shares that
entitled the holders, directly or indirectly, to 75%, or more, of
the income or property of the fund.

Where the above benchmark figures are not met, the Commissioner
172.
will still accept in practice that the “bona fide widely held” requirement has been
satisfied  if  it  is  clear  from  the  constitutive  documents  of  the  fund  and  other
relevant materials that it was established with a view to wide public participation
and that genuine efforts are being taken with the aim of achieving that objective.
That is to say, there is nothing to suggest that the fund is intended to be a closely
held investment vehicle.    The “bona fide widely held” test applies to all funds
though  private  equity  funds  by  their  nature  are  unlikely  to  be  widely  held.
Sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, central banks and government agencies
are separate and independent legal entities with different investment mandates.
Within a private equity fund, each of them is regarded as an investor.    The fact
that  an  investor  is  a  sovereign  wealth  fund,  pension  fund,  central  bank  or
government  agency  cannot  turn  the  private  equity  fund  into  a  widely-held
investment  vehicle.    However,  pension  funds,  central  banks  and  government
agencies resident outside Hong Kong may enjoy tax exemption under sections
20AC or 26A(1A) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions therein.

71

No double deeming

Sections  20AX(9)  and  20AY(8)  specifically  provide  that  a  resident
173.
person  is  not  liable  to  tax  in  respect  of  the  deemed  assessable  profits  if  the
interposed  resident  person  or  any  of  the  interposed  resident  persons  through
whom the resident person holds an indirect beneficial interest in a SPE is liable
to tax under the anti-round tripping provisions in respect of the assessable profits
of the same SPE.

Reporting requirements

Sections 20AX and 20AY impose tax liabilities on a resident person
174.
in respect of the deemed assessable profits earned by a fund and a SPE.    Like
other persons chargeable to tax, the resident person bears the legal obligation of
complying with the provisions of the IRO on reporting chargeability, lodgement
of returns, providing information, payment of tax, etc.    Penalties under Part 14
of the IRO  may  be imposed for failures to comply  with the relevant statutory
provisions.    In determining the tax liability of the resident person, the Assessor
may  be  required  to  examine  the  fund  constitutive  documents  and  accounting
records of the tax-exempted fund.

TAX ASSESSMENT

Assessment on funds and resident persons

175.
Examples showing how assessments, if required, are raised on funds
can  be  found  at  Appendix  4.    Examples  illustrating  the  way  the  anti-round
tripping provisions are applied to resident persons are at Appendix 5.

TAXATION OF INVESTMENT MANAGER

The current practice relating to the taxation of investment managers
176.
remains unchanged.    Paragraphs 72 to 78 of DIPN 51, relating to the application
of anti-abuse provisions to the taxation of investment managers, continue to be
followed.

72

TAX RESIDENCE

Tax residence of funds

177.
A certificate of resident status is a document issued by the Hong Kong
competent authority to a resident of Hong Kong who requires proof of resident
status for the purposes of claiming tax benefits under a specific double taxation
agreement  or  arrangement.    If  a  fund  is  a  resident  of  Hong  Kong  for  the
purposes of a specific double taxation agreement, then a certificate of resident
status will be issued to the fund upon application.

In deciding whether a certificate of resident status should be issued to
178.
a  fund,  all  the  relevant  issues  have  to  be  considered,  including  the  business
substance, the beneficial owner and the entitlement to benefits.    In the absence
of facts or circumstances showing that a fund’s investment is part of an arrangement
or relates to another transaction undertaken for a principal purpose of obtaining
the benefit of a specific double taxation agreement or arrangement, it would not
be reasonable for the treaty partner to deny the benefit to the fund issued with a
certificate of resident status, showing that the fund is a resident of Hong Kong.

If the regional investment platform of a fund is located in Hong Kong
179.
for  acquisition  and  management  of  a  diversified  portfolio  of  private  market
investments in various territories in a regional grouping that includes Hong Kong
and the decision to establish the regional investment platform in Hong Kong is
mainly driven by the availability of fund executives with knowledge of regional
business  practices  and  regulations,  then  the  benefits  under  a  double  tax
agreement or arrangement should be available to the fund.14

A  private  equity  fund,  which  is  usually  structured  as  a  limited
180.
partnership, is regarded as resident in Hong Kong if the central management and
control of the limited partnership is exercised in Hong Kong.    The fact that the
general  partner  resides  outside  Hong  Kong  does  not  necessarily  lead  to  the
conclusion that the central management and control of the private equity fund is
located outside Hong Kong.    Where the central management and control of a
private  equity  fund  is  exercised  by  the  general  partner,  the  residence  of  the
private  equity  fund  is  the  place  where  the  central  management  and  control  is
exercised by the general partner.    Though the central management and control

14

Example  K  at  paragraph  182  of  the  Commentary  on  Article  29  of  the  OECD  Model  Tax
Convention on Income and Capital (10th edition of the condensed version).

73

may  be  exercised  by  the  general  partner  in  Hong  Kong,  the  actual  business
operations of a private equity fund may take place outside Hong Kong.

181.
For  umbrella  arrangements  and  sub-funds  (e.g.  protected  cell
companies), it would usually follow that each sub-fund has the same residence
status as the overall arrangement.    In the case of a corporation resident in Hong
Kong, it is expected that each sub-fund would also be resident in Hong Kong if
it  is  under  the  “central  management  and  control”  of  the  directors  of  the
corporation which constitutes the overall arrangement.    In the case of a trustee
of a trust estate resident in Hong Kong, it is expected that each sub-fund would
also be resident in Hong Kong if the “central management and control” of the
trust estate which constitutes the overall arrangement is exercised in Hong Kong.

Tax residence of SPE

Since  the  operation  of  a  SPE  is  very  restrictive  by  definition  (i.e.
182.
holding  and  administering  investee  private  companies  in  the  capacity  of  a
shareholder), the place of residence of the SPE, wholly or partially owned by a
private equity fund, generally follows that of the private equity fund despite that
the SPE might be incorporated, registered or appointed in Hong Kong.

183.
The certificate of resident status would only be issued to a SPE as a
proof of its resident status for claiming tax  benefits under the relevant double
taxation agreement or arrangement if it can be proved that the SPE is resident in
Hong Kong.    In deciding whether a certificate of resident status could be issued
to  a  SPE,  all  the  facts  and  circumstances  would  be  examined  to  determine
whether the SPE has substantial business activities in Hong Kong (e.g. whether
the  SPE  has  a  permanent  office  or  employs  staff  in  Hong  Kong  to  hold  and
administer its investment in investee private companies).

The issue of a certificate of resident status will be refused if the SPE
184.
is a mere conduit.    In such a case, the SPE will not be regarded as a resident of
Hong  Kong.    The  issue  of  a  certificate  of  resident  status  to  a  SPE  will  not
guarantee that it will be successful in its claim to treaty benefits.    The decision
as to whether relief from foreign taxes can be granted is, ultimately, one to be
made  by  the  treaty  partner.    It  will  be  up  to  the  treaty  partner  to  determine
whether all the relevant conditions are fulfilled and whether the benefits should
be granted.

Appendix 1

Major Features of an Open-Ended Fund Company

Legal framework for the open-ended fund company

To diversify the fund management platform, a legal framework for a
1.
fund structure in the form of open-ended fund company (OFC) has been put in
place in Hong Kong.    The OFC regime allows funds to be set up in corporate
form.    The OFC regime, commenced on 30 July 2018, is implemented through
the following:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the  Securities  and  Futures  (Amendment)  Ordinance  2016
which  provides  a  legal  framework  for  the  OFC  regime  and
empowers  the  Securities  and  Futures  Commission  (SFC)  to
issue  codes  and  guidelines  in  relation  to  the  regulation  of
OFCs;

the  Securities  and  Futures  (Open-ended  Fund  Companies)
Rules (Cap. 571AQ) (OFC Rule)  which set  out the detailed
statutory  requirements  concerning  an  OFC’s  formation  and
maintenance,  appointment  and  cessation  of  appointment  of
key  operators  of  an  OFC  (i.e.  the  directors,  investment
manager  and  custodian),  the  functions  of  the  Registrar  of
Companies  (CR)  (primarily  in  respect  of  incorporation  and
corporate filings), the segregated liability feature of sub-funds
of OFCs, winding-up, and offences;

the  Securities  and  Futures  (Open-ended  Fund  Companies)
(Fees)  Regulation  (Cap.  571AR)  which  concerns  the  fees
charged by the SFC and the Registrar of Companies; and

 the  Code  on  Open-Ended  Fund  Companies  (OFC  Code),
which  is  made  under  section  112ZR  of  the  Securities  and
Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571) (SFO), provides guidelines in
respect  of  matters  relating  to  the  registration,  management,
and operation of OFCs and their business.

i

The  SFC,  being  the  principal  regulator,  is  responsible  for  the
2.
registration and regulation of OFCs.    The CR oversees the incorporation and
statutory corporate filings of OFCs.

Structure and key features

3.
 An  OFC  is  an  open-ended  collective  investment  scheme,  which  is
structured  in  corporate  form  with  limited  liability  and  variable  share  capital.
The OFC structure has characteristics similar to a conventional limited company
in  that  it  has  a  legal  personality;  it  has  a  constitutional  document,  namely  the
Instrument  of  Incorporation;  it  is  governed  by  a  board  of  directors  who  are
subject to fiduciary duties; and the liabilities of its shareholders are limited to the
amount unpaid on their shares in the OFC.    The OFC could be a publicly1  or
privately2  offered fund.

4.

However, being an investment vehicle, an OFC should not be:

bound  by  restrictions  on  the  reduction  of  share  capital
applicable
the  Company
Ordinance  (Cap.  622)  (CO),  and  instead  will  have  the
flexibility to vary its share capital in order to meet shareholder
subscription and redemption requests;

bound  by  restrictions  on  distribution  out  of  share  capital
applicable  to  companies  formed  under  the  CO  and  instead,
may  distribute  out  of  share  capital  subject  to  solvency  and
disclosure requirements; and

required  to  be  licensed  as  a  licensed  corporation  under  the
SFO, but will have to be registered with the SFC, and should

its

1    A publicly offered OFC is a fund that is offered for sale to the public in Hong Kong and should be

subject to the authorization of the SFC.

2 A privately offered OFC is a fund that is not offered for sale to the public in Hong Kong and is not

subject to the authorization of the SFC.

ii

Key operators

The directors, the investment manager and the custodian are the key
5.
operators  of  an  OFC.    The  key  operators  have  to  meet  some  basic  eligibility
requirements.    The OFC board is legally responsible for all the affairs of the
OFC and will provide an additional layer of oversight for shareholders.    As the
investment  management  functions  of  the  OFC  are  delegated  to  an  investment
manager,  individual  directors  of  the  OFC  board  will  not  be  required  to  be
licensed under the SFO.    While there is no requirement for the directors to be
residents of Hong Kong, each of the non-resident directors of the OFC should
appoint a process agent in Hong Kong to accept service of process.    Also, the
investment managers are required to be those licensed by or registered with the
SFC to carry out a Type 9 regulated activity.

The assets of an OFC must be segregated from those of the investment
6.
manager  and  entrusted  to  a  separate,  independent  custodian  for  safekeeping.
Aside from a custodian incorporated in Hong Kong, an OFC may also appoint
an  overseas  custodian,  provided  that  it  has  a  place  of  business  or  an  agent  in
Hong  Kong  for  the  purpose  of  accepting  the  service  of  notices  and  legal
documents in Hong Kong.

Investment scope and fund operation

7.
A publicly offered OFC is allowed by the SFC to invest in asset classes
in  accordance  with  the  SFC’s  product  code  requirements  and  authorization
conditions (i.e. mainly in securities and futures).    A privately offered OFC is
allowed by the SFC to invest in asset classes in accordance with the OFC Code3.

An OFC  may  also be  created as an  umbrella fund  meaning that the
8.
OFC could consist of  a number of separately pooled  sub-funds and each sub-
fund  would  have  a  pool  of  assets  that  is  managed  in  accordance  with  the
investment  objectives  and  policies  for  that  particular  sub-fund.    Further,  a
protected cell structure is made available for an OFC, such that the assets of a
sub-fund of an umbrella OFC belong exclusively to that sub-fund and shall not

3    According to the OFC Code published in July 2018, a privately offered OFC must invest at least 90%
of  its  gross  asset  value  in  those  asset  types  the  management  of  which  would  constitute  a Type  9
regulated activity (i.e. mainly securities and futures) contracts, and/ or cash, bank deposits, certificates
of deposit, foreign currencies and foreign exchange contracts.    A privately offered OFC may also
invest in other asset classes, but only up to 10% of its gross asset value.

iii

be used to discharge the liabilities of or claims against the umbrella OFC or any
other sub-fund.

Incorporation and registration of an OFC

To incorporate an OFC, the applicant (e.g. a proposed director, senior
9.
executive of investment manager) should apply to the SFC for registration prior
to  applying  to  the  CR  for  incorporation.    Once  the  SFC  is  satisfied  that  the
registration requirements are met, it will issue a notice of registration to the CR.
The CR will incorporate an OFC if it has received the notice of registration and
other relevant documents from the SFC and is satisfied that the requirements for
incorporation have been met.  The registration of the OFC will take effect only
on the day of issue of the certificate of incorporation by the CR.

An  OFC  is  required  to  register  under  the  Business  Registration
10.
Ordinance  (Cap.  310).
  Under  the  one-stop  company  incorporation  and
business  registration  service,  the  CR  will  issue  to  the  OFC  the  first  business
registration certificate on behalf of the Commissioner simultaneously together
with the certificate of incorporation.    A sub-fund of an OFC is not required to
apply for a branch registration.    Where the business of an OFC is carried on at
more than one address, the OFC is required to apply for branch registration in
respect of the business carried on at the place other than its main business address.

Filing obligations of an OFC after incorporation

As an OFC is incorporated under the SFO, the OFC will be subject to
11.
the filing obligations under the SFO and the OFC Rules (rather than the CO).
The CR is responsible for the administration of statutory corporate filings of an
OFC, keeping records of information relating to an OFC and the provision to the
public with services to access the OFC information that it holds.    Details on the
filing obligations of an OFC after incorporation and search on OFC information
can be found at the CR’s website (www.cr.gov.hk).    More information can be
found at the SFC’s website (www.sfc.hk).

Termination of OFC

Under section 112ZH of the SFO, an OFC may apply to the SFC for
12.
cancellation of registration voluntarily upon termination (voluntary termination).

iv

The OFC must follow all applicable procedures in the OFC Rules and OFC Code
in relation to an application for a voluntary termination.    After the OFC’s assets
have been fully realized, all liabilities have been settled and proceeds have been
distributed to shareholders of the OFC, the board of directors can submit relevant
documents  to  the  SFC  and  apply  for  cancellation  of  registration  of  the  OFC.
When submitting an application for cancellation of registration of the OFC, the
board of directors should ensure that the OFC has no outstanding tax liabilities
by obtaining a tax clearance letter from the Department.

for qualifying transactions are set out in the ensuing paragraphs.

The relevant definitions and their interpretation of the classes of assets

Securities

3.

In section 1 of Part 2 of Schedule 16C, “securities” is defined to mean:

(a)

(b)

(c)

subject to section 21(6) of Schedule 17A (specified alternative
bond scheme and its tax treatment), shares, stocks, debentures,
loan  stocks,  funds,  bonds  or  notes  of,  or  issued  by,  a  body
(including a special purpose entity), whether incorporated or
unincorporated,  or  a  government  or  municipal  government
authority;

rights,  options  or  interests  (whether  described  as  units  or
otherwise) in, or in respect of, such shares, stocks, debentures,
loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes;

certificates of interest or participation in, temporary or interim
certificates  for,  receipts  for,  or  warrants  to  subscribe  for  or
purchase, such shares, stocks, debentures, loan stocks, funds,
bonds or notes;

(d)

interests in any collective investment scheme;

(e)

(f)

interests,  rights  or  property,  whether  in  the  form  of  an
instrument or otherwise, commonly known as securities; or

a  structured  product  in  respect  of  which  the  issue  of  any
advertisement,  invitation  or  document  that  is  or  contains  an
invitation  to  the  public  to  do  any  act  referred  to  in  section
103(1)(a)  of  the  SFO  is  authorized,  or  required  to  be
authorized, under section 105(1) of that Ordinance.

 ii

For the purposes of paragraphs 3(a), (b) and (c) above in the definition
4.
of  “securities”,  a  regulatory  capital  security  is  treated  as  a  bond.    Section
20AN(7) provides that section 21 of Schedule 17A provides for modifications to
that section.

Section  1  of  Part  2  of  Schedule  16C  also  contains  definitions  of
5.
“collective  investment  scheme”,  “debenture”  and  “share”  in  relation  to  the
meaning of “securities”.

The  term  “collective  investment  scheme”  is  defined  in  section  1  of
6.
Part 2 of Schedule 16C.    The meaning of “collective investment scheme” aligns
with  the  meaning  of  “fund”  in  section  20AM(2)  and  is  similar  to  that  of
“collective investment scheme” set out in section 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the
SFO.    Interest in a private equity fund in the form of a limited partnership could
constitute “securities” so long as the private equity fund falls within the meaning
of “collective investment scheme”.

The term “debenture”, as defined in section 1 of Part 2 of Schedule
7.
16C, includes debenture stocks, bonds, and other debt securities of a corporation
(whether constituting a charge on the assets of the corporation or not).    In this
context,  the  term  “other  debt  securities”  covers  bills  of  exchange,  promissory
notes or instruments which evidence an obligation to pay a stated or determinable
amount of money to the bearer or to the bearer’s order, on or before a fixed time,
with or without endorsement, and the right to receive that stated or determinable
amount of money, with or without interest, is transferable.    Loans or distressed
debts structured in the form of securities are assets of a Schedule 16C class.

The term “share” is defined to mean any shares in the share capital of
8.
a  corporation,  and,  except  where  a  distinction  between  stock  and  shares  is
expressed or implied, includes stock.

Shares, stocks, debentures, loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes of, or issued by,
a private company

9.
In  this  context,  the  term  “private  company”,  as  defined  in  section
20AO(4), means a company incorporated in or outside Hong Kong that is not
allowed  to  issue  any  invitation  to  the  public  to  subscribe  for  any  shares  or
debentures of the company.

 iii

Futures contracts

10.

“Futures contract” is defined to mean:

(a)

a contract or an option on a contract made under the rules or
convention of a futures market; or

(b)

any other contract for differences–

(i)

that is listed on a specified stock exchange, or traded on
a  specified  futures  exchange,  within  the  meaning  of
section 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the SFO;

(ii)

that an authorized institution within the meaning of the
Banking  Ordinance  (Cap.  155)  (BO)  may  enter  into
under that ordinance; or

(iii)  the  transaction  in  respect  of  which  is  regulated  by  or
under, or is carried out in compliance with, the SFO.

11.
In  relation  to  paragraph  10(b)  above  in  the  definition  of  “futures
contract”, the term “contract for differences” is defined to mean an agreement
the purpose or effect of which is to obtain a profit or avoid a loss by reference to
fluctuations in the value or price of property of any description or in an index or
other factor designated for that purpose in the agreement.    In general terms, a
contract for differences is a contract which rides on the differences in the value
of  the  underlying  property  or  index,  which  is  commonly  used  for  hedging
purposes in the financial market.    It covers a wide range of contracts, including
the common types of financial derivatives traded (e.g. cash-settled commodity
futures contract, Hang Seng Index futures contract, etc.).

12.
The  definition  of  “futures  contract”  covers  contracts  for  differences
that  may  be  properly  carried  out  through  a  specified  stock  exchange  or  a
specified  futures  exchange,  as  well  as  those  entered  into  by  an  authorized
institution  under  the  BO  and  those  that  are  regulated  by  or  carried  out  in
compliance with the SFO.

iv

Foreign exchange contracts

“Foreign exchange contract” is a contract under which the parties to
13.
the  contract  agree  to  exchange  different  currencies  on  a  particular  time.    It
covers both leveraged and non-leveraged foreign exchange transactions.    The
transactions may involve entirely foreign currencies, or foreign currencies and
Hong Kong dollars.

Deposit other than by way of a money-lending business

14.

“Deposit” is defined to mean a loan of money:

(a)

at interest; or

(b)

repayable at a premium or repayable with any consideration
in money or money’s worth.

15.
Funds in the normal course of business may hold money deposits in
their  asset  portfolios.    This  asset  class  covers  the  holding  of  such  money
deposits, which may be in any currency.    As clearly provided, this asset class
does not cover cases where a person makes deposits in the ordinary course of
carrying on a money-lending business.    The term “money-lending business” is
not defined and would be accorded its ordinary meaning.    It is a question of fact
whether a money-lending business is carried on.    In the context of the IRO, it
has  been  decided  in  tax  cases  that  in  determining  whether  a  money-lending
business  is  carried  on,  the  absence  of  a  money-lender’s  licence  granted  under
other ordinances is not conclusive.    See Shun Lee Investment Co., Ltd. v CIR, 1
HKTC 322 and Board of Review Decision D38/89, IRBRD vol 4, 433.    Though
“deposit” is defined to mean “a loan of money”, this asset class “deposit other
than  by  way  of  a  money-lending  business”  should  not  cover  “loan”,  whether
made out or acquired as investment.

Exchange-traded commodities

16.
 “Exchange-traded  commodity”  is  defined  to  mean  gold  or  silver
traded  on  a  commodity  exchange  in  Hong  Kong  to  which  the  Commodity
Exchanges (Prohibition) Ordinance (Cap. 82) (CEPO) does not apply by virtue
of section 3(d) of that ordinance.    The CEPO in general prohibits the operation

v

of commodity exchanges in Hong Kong with the exception of those provided in
section 3 thereof.    Section 3(d) of the CEPO refers to a commodity exchange
which  was  in  operation  on  20  June  1973.    The  Chinese  Gold  and  Silver
Exchange Society is a commodity exchange in Hong Kong to which the CEPO
does  not  apply  by  virtue  of  section  3(d).    This  type  of  specified  transactions
therefore covers transactions in gold or silver traded on the Chinese Gold and
Silver Exchange Society.

Foreign currencies

17.
Transactions in “foreign currencies” cover spot transactions in foreign
currencies (transactions in exchanging currencies at a future time are covered by
“transaction  in  foreign  exchange  contracts”)  and  transactions  in  exchanging
foreign currencies from or to Hong Kong dollars.

OTC derivative products

An “OTC derivative product” is defined in section 1B(1) in Part 1 of
18.
Schedule  1  to  the  SFO  to  mean  a  structured  product,  subject  to  a  number  of
exclusions under section 1B(2) and inclusion in section 1B(3).    This definition
is added to this Schedule by the Securities and Futures (Amendment) Ordinance
2014, which seeks to establish a framework for regulation of over-the-counter
derivative  products  and  transactions.    The  definitions  of  “OTC  derivative
products” and “OTC derivative transactions” came into effect on 10 July 2015.

ITVF Scheme

An  investee  company’s  shares  co-invested  by  a  partner  fund  and
19.
ITVFC  under  the  ITVF  Scheme  is  one  of  the  classes  of  assets  for  qualifying
transactions.    On  and  after  1 April  2019,  a  partner  fund,  whether  onshore  or
offshore, joining the ITVF Scheme, is eligible for tax exemption under section
20AN in respect of profits derived from co-investment transactions in an investee
company’s shares subject to the following condition:

(a)

the co-investment transactions have been carried out in Hong
Kong by or through a specified person (as defined in section
20AN(6)) or arranged in Hong Kong by a specified person; or

vi

(b)

the partner fund is a qualified investment fund (as defined in
section 20AN(6).

20.
need to be subject to the tests in sections 20AP and 20AQ.

Section  20AR  specifies  that  the  co-investment  transactions  do  not

21.

An investee company as defined in section 20AR(2) means:

(a)

 a  corporation  that  has  ITVFC  and  a  partner  fund  as
shareholders under the ITVF Scheme; or

(b)

a corporation that–

(i)

 had, at any time, ITVFC and a partner fund (Fund A) as
shareholders under the ITVF Scheme; and

(ii)   has,  since  that  time,  continued  to  have  a  partner  fund
(whether  Fund  A  or  another  partner  fund)  as  a
shareholder.

22.
that is a party (whether or not through an agent) to an agreement:

A partner fund is also defined in section 20AR(2) and means a fund

(a)

 to which ITVFC is also a party;

(b)

that stipulates the overall rights and obligations of ITVFC and
the fund in respect of their participation in the ITVF Scheme;
and

(c)

that is valid and in force.

List  of  partner  funds  (or  co-investment  funds)  can  be  found  at  the  website  of
ITVF  administered  by
Information  and  Technology  Commission

Appendix 4

Examples on Raising Assessments on Funds

The exemption provisions in section 20AN apply to a fund as defined
1.
in section 20AM.    Though a business undertaking for general commercial or
industrial purposes is not a fund, the exemption provisions in section 20AC may
apply to a non-resident business undertaking.

Example 4.1

Contractual  Arrangement-F1  was  established  and  resident  in
Jurisdiction-F1  with  five  investors.    In  the  year  of  assessment
2019/20,  Contractual  Arrangement-F1  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong
through a specified person the following transactions:

Schedule 16C transactions1  and
incidental transactions (≤5%)

Non-Schedule 16C2
transactions

Profits of $5m

Profits of $4m

in  section  20AM(6)  and

If  Contractual  Arrangement-F1  was  or  constituted  a  business
undertaking  for  general  commercial  or  industrial  purposes  as
elaborated
then  Contractual
Arrangement-F1  would  not  be  regarded  as  a  “fund”  under  section
20AM for the purposes of tax exemption.    However, the provisions
in section 20AC would be applicable to Contractual Arrangement-F1,
subject to the conditions therein, if it was a non-fund person resident
outside Hong Kong.

(7),

If  the  non-Schedule  16C  transactions  related  to  assets  which  were
normally  purchased  and  sold  in  the  normal  course  of  business  of  a
commercial or industrial enterprise, in particular those mentioned in
section  20AM(7),  then  Contractual  Arrangement-F1  might  be  a
business undertaking, depending on the facts and circumstances.

1

2

“Schedule 16C transactions” means transactions in assets of a class specified in Schedule 16C.
 “Non-Schedule 16C transactions” means transactions in assets of a class that is not specified in
Schedule 16C.

i

If Contractual Arrangement-F1 fell within the definition of “fund” in
section  20AM,  tax  exemption  on  profits  of  $5m  derived  from
Schedule  16C  transactions  and  incidental  transactions  would  be
allowed  under  section  20AN(2)(a)  and  (b).    Profits  tax  assessment
for  the  year  of  assessment  2019/20  would  be  raised  on  Contractual
Arrangement-F1 in respect of profits derived from non-Schedule 16C
transactions.

Profits derived by a fund from Schedule 16C transactions carried out
2.
or arranged in Hong Kong and incidental transactions thereof are chargeable to
profits tax if not because of the exemption provided in section 20AN.    The fund
is exempt from payment of tax in respect of profits derived from the Schedule
16C  transactions  and  incidental  transactions  thereof  if  the  Schedule  16C
transactions are carried out in Hong Kong by or through a specified person or
arranged in Hong Kong by a specified person.    Profits derived by a fund from
non-Schedule  16C  transactions  carried  out  or  arranged  in  Hong  Kong  are
chargeable  to  profits  tax.    Specified  person  is  not  required  if  the  fund  is  a
qualified investment fund.

 Example 4.2

Limited Partnership-F2, resident in Jurisdiction-F2, was established
as  an  investment  fund  and  fell  within  the  definition  of  “fund”  in
section  20AM.
  In  the  year  of  assessment  2019/20,  Limited
Partnership-F2 carried out or arranged in Hong Kong the following
transactions:

Schedule 16C transactions and
incidental transactions (≤5%)

Non-Schedule 16C
transactions

Profits of $10m

Profits of $5m

If  the  non-Schedule  16C  transactions  related  to  assets  which  were
normally  purchased  and  sold  in  the  normal  course  of  business  of  a
commercial or industrial enterprise, in particular those mentioned in
section 20AM(7), then Limited Partnership-F2 might in fact constitute
a business undertaking, depending on the facts and circumstances.

ii

If the Schedule 16C transactions were carried out in Hong Kong by or
through a specified person or arranged in Hong Kong by a specified
person,  then  tax  exemption  on  profits  of  $10m  derived  from  the
Schedule  16C  transactions  and  incidental  transactions  would  be
allowed under section 20AN(2)(a) and (b).

If the Schedule 16C transactions were not carried out in Hong Kong
by  or  through  a  specified  person  or  arranged  in  Hong  Kong  by  a
specified person, then tax exemption on profits of $10m derived from
the Schedule 16C transactions and incidental transactions would not
be  allowed  under  section  20AN(2)(a)  and  (b)  unless  Limited
Partnership-F2 was a qualified investment fund as defined in section
20AN(6).

Profits tax assessment for the  year of assessment 2019/20 would be
raised on Limited Partnership-F2 in respect of profits derived from the
non-Schedule 16C transactions.

3.

Profits derived by a fund which is an open-ended fund company (OFC)

from  Schedule  16C  transactions  and  incidental  transactions  thereof  would  be
exempt from profits tax under section 20AN(2)(a) and (b) if the Schedule 16C
transactions are carried out in Hong Kong by or through a specified person or
arranged in Hong Kong by a specified person.    Section 112Z of the Securities
and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 517) (SFO) requires an OFC to have an investment
manager who is responsible for managing the scheme property of the company.
The investment manager of the OFC is required to be licensed or registered for
a Type 9 regulated activity.

4.
Profits derived by a fund which is an  OFC from non-Schedule 16C
transactions would be exempt from profits tax under section 20AN(2)(c) unless
such profits were derived from:

(a)

direct trading or direct business undertaking in Hong Kong; or

(b)  utilization of non-Schedule 16C assets held to generate income.

iii

Example 4.3

OFC-HK1 was incorporated in Hong Kong on 1 April 2019.    At all
times, OFC-HK1 complied with the 10% de minimis rule as set out in
the Securities and Futures Commission’s (SFC) Code on Open-Ended
Fund  Companies  (OFC  Code).    During  the  year  of  assessment
2019/20, OFC-HK carried out in Hong Kong, through an investment
manager licensed for a Type 9 regulated activity as required under the
OFC Code, the following transactions:

Schedule 16C transactions and
incidental transactions (≤5%)

Non-Schedule 16C
transactions

Profits of $10m

Profits of $5m

OFC-HK1, subject to the regulatory requirements of the SFC, would
be  accepted  as  a  fund  under  section  20AM  for  the  purposes  of  tax
exemption.

Tax  exemption  on  profits  of  $10m derived from the Schedule 16C
transactions  and  incidental  transactions  would  be  allowed  under
section  20AN(2)(a)  and  (b).    Tax  exemption  on  profits  of  $5m
derived  from  the  non-Schedule  16C  transactions  would  also  be
granted under section  20AN(2)(c) unless  such  profits  were  derived
from  direct  trading  or  direct  business  undertaking  in  Hong  Kong
or utilization of non-Schedule 16C assets held to generate income.

No profits tax assessment would be raised on OFC-HK1 for the year
of assessment 2019/20.

Example 4.4

OFC-HK2 was incorporated in Hong Kong on 1 April 2019.    At all
times, OFC-HK2 complied with the 10% de minimis rule as set out in
the SFC’s OFC Code.    During the year of assessment 2019/20, OFC-
HK2 carried out the following transactions:

iv

Schedule 16C transactions and
incidental transactions (≤5%)

Non-Schedule 16C
transactions

Profits of $15m

Direct trading profits of $10m

OFC-HK2, subject to the regulatory requirements of the SFC, would
be  accepted  as  a  fund  under  section  20AM  for  the  purposes  of  tax
exemption.

If the Schedule 16C transactions were carried out in Hong Kong by or
through a specified person or arranged in Hong Kong by a specified
person, tax exemption on profits of $15m derived from the Schedule
16C transactions and incidental transactions would be allowed under
section 20AN(2)(a) and (b).

Profits  of  $10m  derived  from  the  non-Schedule  16C  transactions
would not be exempt from profits tax under section 20AS since such
profits were derived from direct trading of non-Schedule 16C assets.

Profits tax assessment would be raised on OFC-HK2 for the year of
assessment 2019/20 in respect of profits derived from direct trading of
non-Schedule 16C assets.

5.
 The assessable profits  of an umbrella OFC would be the total of the
assessable profits of all of its sub-funds, each of which would be regarded as an
OFC for computing assessable profits of the sub-fund.

Example 4.5

OFC-HK3 was incorporated in Hong Kong under Part IVA of SFO on
1 April  2019.    Sub-Fund A  and  Sub-Fund  B  were  the  sub-funds  of
OFC-HK3.  OFC-HK3  was  a  privately  offered  OFC  subject  to  the
regulatory  requirements  of  the  SFC.    At  all  times,  OFC-HK3,  Sub-
Fund  A  and  Sub-Fund  B  complied  with  the  Securities  and  Futures
(Open-ended  Fund  Companies)  Rules  (OFC  Rules)  and  OFC  Code
(including the 10% de minimis rule).    During the year of assessment
2019/20,  Sub-Fund  A  and  Sub-Fund  B  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong,
through a specified person, the following transactions:

v

Schedule 16C transactions and
incidental transactions (≤5%)

Non-Schedule
16C transactions

Sub-Fund A

Profits of $1m

Loss of $2m

Sub-Fund B

Loss of $0.5m

Profits of $2m

Insofar as OFC-HK3, Sub-Fund A and Sub-Fund B were concerned,
they complied with the OFC Rules and the OFC Code (including the
10%  de  minimis  rule).    Since  at  all  times  during  the  year  of
assessment they complied with the OFC Code, they would be accepted
as funds under section 20AM for the purposes of tax exemption.

Profits from the Schedule 16C transactions and incidental transactions
would be exempt from tax under section 20AN(2)(a) and (b).    Profits
from the non-Schedule 16C transactions would also be exempt under
section  20AN(2)(c)  from  tax  unless  such  profits  were  derived  from
direct  trading  or  direct  business  undertaking  in  Hong  Kong  or
utilization of non-Schedule 16C assets held to generate income.

Tax treatment of OFC-HK3, Sub-Fund A and Sub-Fund B for the year
of assessment 2019/20 would be as follows:

Sub-Fund A
Tax exemption on profits of $1m from the Schedule 16C transactions
and incidental transactions would be allowed.    Since profits derived
from  the  non-Schedule  16C  transactions  would  have  been  tax
exempted under section 20AN(2)(c), the loss of $2m incurred in the
year of assessment 2019/20 from the non-Schedule 16C transactions
would not be carried forward under section 20AV(2) to set off against
any of its assessable profits in any subsequent year of assessment.

Sub-Fund B
Tax  exemption  in  respect  of  profits  of  $2m  derived  from  the  non-
Schedule  16C  class  would  be  allowed  under  section  20AN(2)(c)
unless assessable under section 20AS.    Since profits derived from the
Schedule  16C  transactions  and  incidental  transactions  would  have
been tax exempted under section 20AN(2)(a) and (b), loss of $0.5m

vi

the  Schedule  16C

incidental
derived  from
transactions would not be carried forward under section 20AV(2) to
set off against any of its profits in any subsequent year of assessment.

transactions  and

OFC-HK3
Profits tax assessment, if any, would be issued under section 20AT(2)
in  the  name  of  HK-OFC3.    OFC-HK3’s  tax  liability  would  be  the
aggregate amount of tax liability, if any, of each of its sub-funds (i.e.
Sub-Fund A and Sub-Fund B).    For the year of assessment 2019/20,
neither profits tax assessment nor statement of loss would be issued to
OFC-HK3.

Appendix 5

Examples on Applying the Anti-round Tripping Provisions

When applying the anti-round tripping provisions in section 20AX(1)
1.
relating  to  a  fund  which  has  profits  exempted  from  tax  under  section  20AN,
reference has to be made to a resident person’s beneficial interest:

(a)

(b)

both direct and indirect beneficial interests are to be taken into
account; and

beneficial  interests  held  by  associates  are  to  be  taken  into
account.

Example 5.1

Company-HK1, a company resident in Hong Kong, held directly 20%
and indirectly 15%, through other persons, of the issued share capital
of Mutual Fund Corp-F1.    Mutual Fund Corp-F1 was a mutual fund
corporation  established  and  resident  in  Jurisdiction-F1,  having
profits exempted from tax under section 20AN.

Company-HK1’s  direct  and  indirect  beneficial  interests  in  Mutual
Fund  Corp-F  aggregated  35%  (i.e.  20%  +  15%),  exceeding  the
threshold  of  “not  less  than  30%”  in  section  20AX(2).    Per  section
20AX(1), 35% of the profits of Mutual Fund Corp-F1 exempted from
tax under section 20AN would be deemed to be the assessable profits
of Company-HK1.

Example 5.2

Company-HK2 and Company-HK3 were companies resident in Hong
Kong.    They were subsidiaries of Holding Company-F2, resident in
Jurisdiction-F2.    Company-HK2 and Company-HK3 held 20% and
25% respectively of the issued share capital of Mutual Fund Corp-F2,
a mutual fund corporation, resident in Jurisdiction-F2, having profits
exempted from tax under section 20AN.

i

Company-HK2 and Company-HK3 were associated corporations and
  Since  their
were  therefore  associates  under  section  20AN(6).
beneficial interests in Mutual Fund Corp-F2 equalled in total 45% (i.e.
20% + 25%), exceeding the threshold of “not less than 30%”, 20% and
25% of the profits of Mutual Fund Corp-F2 exempted under section
20AN would be deemed to be the assessable profits of Company-HK2
and Company-HK3 respectively.

Though Holding Company-F2, having indirect beneficial interests in
Mutual  Fund  Corp-F2,  was  resident  outside  Hong  Kong,  the  anti-
round  tripping  provisions  would  apply  since  Company-HK2  and
Company-HK3 were residents in Hong Kong.

Example 5.3

Facts were the same as those in Example 5.2 except that Company-
HK3 was a company resident outside Hong Kong.

Per  section  20AX(2),  the  beneficial  interest  of  Company-HK2,  a
person resident in Hong Kong, would include the issued share capital
of Mutual Fund Corp-F2 held by Company-HK2 and Company-HK3
even  though  Company-HK3  was  an  associate  of  Company-HK2
resident outside Hong Kong.

Since the total beneficial interests of Company-HK2 in Mutual Fund
Corp-F2 amounted to 45% (i.e. 20% + 25%), exceeding the threshold
of “not less than 30%”, 20% of the profits of Mutual Fund Corp-F2
exempted under section 20AN would be deemed to be the assessable
profits  of  Company-HK2.    No  profits  of  Mutual  Fund  Corp-F2
exempted under section 20AN would be deemed to be the assessable
profits  of  Company-HK3  since  the  anti-round  tripping  provisions
were not to be applied to a non-resident.

The anti-round tripping provisions in section 20AX(3) would apply in
2.
respect  of  any  percentage  of  beneficial  interests  held  in  a  fund  which  is  an
associate of a resident person.

ii

Example 5.4

Fund(LP)-F3,  established  as  a  limited  partnership,  was  a  private
equity fund resident in Jurisidiction-F3.    Company-HK4, a company
resident in Hong Kong, was entitled to 20% of the profits of Fund(LP)-
F3.    Fund(LP)-F3  was  an  associate  of  Company-HK4  and  had
profits exempted from tax under section 20AN.

The  anti-round  tripping  provisions  in  section  20AX(1)  would  not
apply since the beneficial interest of Company-HK4 in Fund(LP)-F3
was less than 30%.    However, the anti-round tripping provisions in
section 20AX(3) would apply since Fund(LP)-F3 was an associate of
Company-HK4.    All  profits  of  Fund(LP)-F3  exempted  from  tax
under section 20AN would be deemed to be the assessable profits of
Company-HK4.

Example 5.5

Facts were the same as those in Example 5.4 except that Fund(LP)-
F3  was  not  an  associate  of  Company-HK4.    Company-HK4  was
entitled to 20% and 35% of the profits of Fund(LP)-F3 in the years of
assessment 2019/20 and 2020/21 respectively.

The  anti-round  tripping  provisions  in  section  20AX(1)  would  not
apply in the year of assessment 2019/20 since the beneficial interest
of Company-HK4 in Fund(LP)-F3 was less than 30%.    However, the
anti-round tripping provisions would apply in the year of assessment
2020/21 since the beneficial interest of Company-HK4 in Fund(LP)-
F3  was  not  less  than  30%.    35%  of  the  profits  of  Fund(LP)-F3
exempted from tax under section 20AN would be deemed to be the
assessable  profits  of  Company-HK4  for  the  year  of  assessment
2020/21.

When applying the anti-round tripping provisions in section 20AX(1)
3.
or section 20AY(1), the deemed assessable profits of a resident person would be
the total sum arrived at by adding up:

iii

(a)

(b)

the profits of the fund exempted under section 20AN for each
day in the period during which the resident person has a direct
or indirect interest of not less than 30% in the fund; and

the profits of the special purpose entity exempted under section
20AO  for  each  day  in  the  period  during  which  the  resident
person  has  an  indirect  interest  of  not  less  than  30%  in  the
special purpose entity.

Example 5.6

On  1  October  2019,  Company-HK5,  a  company  resident  in  Hong
Kong,  acquired  an  interest  of  20%  in  value  of  the  trust  estate  of
Fund(T)-F4.    Fund(T)-F4,  structured  in  the  form  of  a  trust,  was
resident  in  Jurisdiction-F4.    Fund(T)-F4  was  not  an  associate  of
Company-HK5.    Company-HK5  and  its  associates  had  no  other
beneficial interest in Fund(T)-F4.

Company-SPE  was  a  special  purpose  entity  wholly  owned  by
Fund(T)-F4.    It  was  used  to  hold  Company-F5  which  was  an
investee  private  company  in  Jurisdiction-F5.    On  1  January  2020,
Company-HK5  purchased a further interest  of 30%  in Fund(T)-F4.
Fund(T)-F4 closed its accounts on 31 March every year.

In the year ended 31 March 2020, Fund(T)-F4 derived profits of $80m,
excluding  distributions  from  Company-SPE,  which  were  exempted
from  tax  under  section  20AN.    Company-SPE  derived  profits  of
$100m from disposal of shares in Company-F5 which were exempted
from tax under section 20AO.

Deemed  assessable  profits  of  Company-HK5  for  the  year  of
assessment 2019/20 would be computed as follows:

[$80m  ×   50%  ×   (91  days  ÷   366  days)]  +  [$100m  ×   50%  ×
100%  ×  (91 days  ÷  366 days)] = $22.4m

Number  of  days  from  1  January  2020  to  31  March  2020  was  91.
Days from 1 April 2019 to 31 December 2019 would not be taken into

iv

account since Company-HK5 held a beneficial interest of 20% (i.e.
less than 30%) in Fund(T)-F4 during this period.

4.
If  an  interposed  person  is  a  resident  person  who  is  liable  to  tax  in
respect of the profits deemed assessable under section 20AX(1) or (3), then the
resident person liable to tax under section 20AX(1) or (3) because of the resident
person’s  indirect  beneficial  interest  in  a  fund  through  that  interposed  person
would  be  discharged  from  liability  per  section  20AX(9).    Equally,  if  an
interposed person is a resident person who is liable to tax in respect of the profits
deemed assessable under section 20AY(1) or (2), then the resident person liable
to  tax  under  section  20AY(1)  or  (2)  because  of  the  resident  person’s  indirect
beneficial interest in a SPE through that interposed person would be discharged
from liability per section 20AY(8).

Example 5.7

Company-HK6 held 90% of the share capital of Company-HK7 which
in turn held 70% of the share capital of Company-HK8.    Company-
HK6, Company-HK7 and Company-HK8 were companies resident in
Hong Kong.

Company-HK8  held  50%  of  the  ownership  interest  in  Investment
Fund-F5  which  was  an  entity  not  structured  in  the  form  of  a
corporation,  partnership  or  trust.    Investment  Fund-F5,  a  fund
resident in Jurisdiction-F5, in turn held an investee private company
through Company-SPE, a wholly owned special purpose entity.

Investment Fund-F5 was exempted from payment of tax in respect of
profits  derived  from  transactions  in  securities  under  section  20AN.
Company-SPE was exempted from payment of tax in respect of profits
derived from sale of specified securities issued by the investee private
company under section 20AO.

Per sections 20AX(1) and 20AY(1), 50% of the profits of Investment
Fund-F5  exempted  from  tax  under  section  20AN  and  50%  of  the
profits  of  Company-SPE  exempted  from  tax  under  section  20AO
would be deemed to be the assessable profits of Company-HK8.

v

liability

Since  Company-HK8  was  liable  to  tax  on  the  deemed  assessable
profits,  Company-HK6  and  Company-HK7  would  be  discharged
tax  per  sections  20AX(9)  and  20AY(8)
from
notwithstanding  that  they  both  held  indirect  beneficial  interests  of
more than 30% (i.e. Company-HK6: 90%  ×  70%  ×  50% = 31.5%;
Company-HK7: 70%  ×  50% = 35%) in Investment Fund-F5.
