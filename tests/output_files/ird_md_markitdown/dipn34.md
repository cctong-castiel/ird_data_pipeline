INTRODUCTION

On  30  June  1998,  the  Chief  Executive  in  Council  made  the
Exemption from Profits Tax (Interest Income) Order 1998 under Section 87 of
the Inland Revenue Ordinance (the Ordinance).   The purpose of the Order is
to exempt persons other than financial institutions from the payment of profits
tax on interest income chargeable under Part IV of the Ordinance.  The Order
has been amended by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Ordinance 2004 (the
2004  Amendment  Ordinance),  in  consequence  of  the  amendments  made  to
section 16 of the Ordinance.

This  Interpretation  and  Practice  Note  sets  out  the  Department’s
2.
views  on  the  application  of  the  Order,  as  revised  to  reflect  the  amendments
made by the 2004 Amendment Ordinance.  In addition, the opportunity is taken
to explain the approach the Department will adopt in respect of practical issues
arising out of the application of the Order.

EXEMPT PERSONS

Taxpayers exempted from payment of profits tax on interest income

3.
to which the Order applies are -

(a)

corporations, other than financial institutions, carrying on
a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong, and

(b)  	 persons,  other  than  corporations,  carrying  on  a  trade,
profession  or  business  in  Hong  Kong  where  the  interest
income  is  in  respect  of  funds  of  the  trade,  profession  or
business.

The  exemption  from  the  payment  of  profits  tax  does  not  apply  to  interest
income received by financial institutions.

A  financial  institution  is  defined  in  section  2  of  the  Ordinance  as

4.
being -

(a)

an  authorized  institution  within  the  meaning  of  section  2
of the Banking Ordinance (Cap. 155);

(b)

	 any  associated  corporation  of  such  an  authorized
institution  which,  being  exempt  by  virtue  of  section
3(2)(a) or (b) or (c) of the Banking Ordinance (Cap. 155),
would  have  been  liable  to  be  authorized  as  a  deposit-
taking  company  or  restricted  licence  bank  under  that
Ordinance had it not been so exempt.

Section 2 of the Banking Ordinance defines the term “authorized institution” as
meaning a bank, restricted licence bank or deposit taking company.

BASIS OF EXEMPTION

5.
The  Order  specifies  that  a  taxpayer  is  exempt  from  the  payment  of
tax on interest income to which the Order applies.  Accordingly, whilst no tax
is  payable  on  the  relevant  interest  income,  the  income  itself  does  not  come
within  the  categorisation  of  “exempt”  income.    Such  income  therefore
continues  to  retain  its  underlying  characteristic  as  chargeable  profits.
Examples of the application of the Order to a number of practical situations are
set out in paragraph 14.

RELEVANT INTEREST INCOME

6.
For the purpose of the Order, the relevant interest income is interest
income derived from any deposit placed with an authorized institution in Hong
Kong  by  a  person  to  whom  the  Order  applies.    Such  person  may  either  be  a
corporation,  or  a  person  other  than  a  corporation,  carrying  on  a  trade,
profession or business in Hong Kong.  Where the person is not a corporation,
the  interest  income  has  to  be  in  respect  of  funds  of  the  trade,  profession  or
business  carrying  on  by  that  person.    It  is  worth  noting  that  interest  income
derived  from  solicitors’  clients’  money  does  not  fall  within  the  scope  of  the
Order.  This is because clients’ money is not funds of the solicitors’ profession
[see  CIR  v.  Messrs.  Lau,  Wong  &  Chan  Solicitors,  2  HKTC  470].  The
currency  in  which  the  deposit  is  denominated  is  not  relevant  and  there  is  no
requirement for the deposit to be evidenced by a certificate of deposit.

2

ASSOCIATED EXPENSES

The interest income that is exempt from the payment of tax is the net
7.
amount  derived  by  the  person  as  reduced  by  all  attributable  losses,  outgoing
and  expenses  incurred  in  the  production  of  that  interest  income.    The  general
principles embodied in the Ordinance requiring an appropriate adjustment to be
made  for  expenses  not  incurred  in  the  production  of  assessable  profits  are
applicable  to  determining  the  amount  of  the  interest  income  that  is  subject  to
exemption from the payment of tax.  Only the net interest income earned (the
interest income received after deduction of attributable costs) is so exempted.

Expenses attributable to Hong Kong-sourced interest income will be
8.
computed  on  the  same  basis  as  that  applied  to  the  calculation  of  offshore
interest income.  The Department’s policy as regards adjustments for expenses
attributable  to  the  earning  of  interest  income  is  only  to  require  an  adjustment
for  expenses  to  be  made  where  there  is  a  direct  link  between  the  expenses  in
question and the interest income in question.  Where the link is merely indirect
or incidental, adjustments to expense deductions are not usually required to be
made.  Assessors do, however, reserve the right to make adjustments in specific
situations  where  the  particular  facts  of  individual  cases  indicate  that  such
adjustments are appropriate in the circumstances.

EFFECTIVE DATE OF ORDER

The exemption from payment of tax applies, in respect of a deposit
9.
placed  or  renewed  prior  to  22  June  1998,  to  the  whole  of  the  interest
accrued on or after that date.  For any new deposits placed on or after 22
June 1998  or any existing deposit renewed on or after that date, the whole of
the  interest  paid  on  such  deposit,  when  received  by  a  qualifying  person,  is
exempt from the payment of tax.

10.
It is well established judicially that interest accrues on a day-to-day
basis.  Accordingly, as regards deposits placed prior to 22 June 1998, only the
interest that accrued on or after 22 June 1998 will qualify for the exemption.  In
particular, any interest that accrued prior to 22 June 1998, whether paid to the
taxpayer  before  or  after  the  date,  will  continue  to  be  subject  to  profits  tax.
Where  the  term  of  a  deposit  straddles  22  June  1998,  it  will  be  necessary  to

3

apportion  any  interest  received  on  a  “days  before”  and  “days  after”  basis  to
ascertain the amount qualifying for exemption under the Order.

11.
For  deposits  placed  with  financial  institutions  on  or  after  22  June
1998,  the  whole  of  the  interest  income  received  will  be  exempt  from  the
payment of profits tax.

DEPOSITS AS SECURITY FOR BANKING FACILITIES

12.
Any  interest  income  arising  on  deposits  that  have  been  pledged  as
collateral for financing facilities is not exempt from the payment of tax, if the
interest  expenses  incurred  on  the  financing  facilities  are  allowable  for  tax
deduction.  While  the  interest  expenses  deduction  scheme  has  been  amended
by  the  2004  Amendment  Ordinance,  the  basic  principles  for  granting
exemption  from  payment  of  tax  under  this  Order  remain  unchanged.    The
positions  on  the  application  of  the  exemption  before  and  after  the  2004
Amendment Ordinance are as follows -

(a)

Before the 2004 Amendment Ordinance

The exemption does not apply to any deposit which is used to
secure  or  guarantee  a  loan  of  money  where  the  condition
specified  in  the  then  section  16(2)(d)  of  the  Ordinance  is
satisfied.  In  such  case,  the  interest  income  earned  from  the
deposit  is  chargeable  to  tax,  while  the  interest  expense
incurred on the loan is allowable for deduction.  The position
remains the same even if there are other securities for the loan
or  the  interest  expense  incurred  on  the  loan  is  less  than  the
interest  income  earned  from  the  deposit.    The  whole  of  the
interest  income  is  chargeable  to  tax  because  the  Order  does
not  allow  partial  exemption  for  the  interest  income.  The
taxpayer  cannot  give  up  the  interest  expense  deduction  and
claim the interest income exemption.

4

(b)  After the 2004 Amendment Ordinance

The exemption does not apply to any deposit which is used to
secure  or  guarantee  a  loan  of  money  where  the  condition
under section 16(2)(c), (d) or (e) of the Ordinance is satisfied
and the restriction on interest expense deduction under section
16(2A) does not apply.  In such  case,  the  interest  expense  is
allowable and the interest income is not exempt from payment
of  tax  by  the  Order,  notwithstanding  that  there  are  other
securities for the loan or the interest expense incurred on the
loan is less than the interest income earned from the deposit.
As  before,  partial  exemption  for  the  interest  income  is  not
allowed.  The  taxpayer  cannot  give  up  the  interest  expense
deduction and claim the interest income exemption.

ADVANCE RULINGS

Section  88A  of  the  Ordinance  permits  the  Commissioner,  upon
13.
application  from  a  person,  to  make  a  ruling  on  matters  specified  in  Part  I  to
Schedule 10 of the Ordinance.  In particular, section 1 of Part I of Schedule 10
provides  that  the  Commissioner  may  make  a  ruling  on  how  any  provision  of
the  Ordinance  applies  to  the  applicant  or  to  the  arrangement  described  in  the
application.  Advance  rulings  may  be  given  in  respect  of  the  application  of
Orders made under section 87.

PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE ORDER

As  noted  above,  the  Order  exempts  taxpayers  from  the  payment  of
14.
profits  tax  on  interest  income  to  which  it  relates.    Notwithstanding  the
legislative approach adopted, the practical effect of the Order is to exempt the
relevant  interest  income  from  tax.  To  ensure  consistency  in  the  basis  of
assessment  with  the  situation  that  would  have  prevailed  had  the  relevant
interest income been excluded from chargeability, the following practices will
be adopted by the Department in finalising assessments -

5

(a)  	 The  Order  will  be  applied  to  the  relevant  interest
income  as  regards  both  the  final  profits  tax  liability
and the provisional profits tax liability.

(b)

In  computing  the  assessable  profits  of  a  taxpayer,  the
relevant  interest  income  will  be  treated  as  “exempt
income”.

as  exempt  income.    The  estimated  1998/99  assessable  profits
are  therefore  less  than  90%  of  the  1997/98  assessable  profits
and provisional tax charged on the relevant income can be held
over.
