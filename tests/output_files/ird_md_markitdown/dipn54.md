INTRODUCTION

Background

Financing  the  global  airline  industry  presents  major  business
opportunities for the financial and professional service sectors in Hong Kong.
The proportion of new aircraft being financed by leasing rose from less than 1%
50 years ago to about 51% in 2021.    There are a myriad of factors contributing
to the attractiveness of aircraft leasing, including: financial flexibility; avoidance
of large upfront investments; fleet flexibility; reduced delivery lead time for new
planes; preservation of capital; and capture of market share without significant
capital commitment (popular among low cost carriers).

In recent years, there has been trendsetting migration of aircraft lessors

2.
to Asia which is driven mainly by growth of the airline industry in the Mainland.
Intra-Asia  leasing  activities  are  particularly  noticeable.    It  is  estimated  that  a
total of over 41,100 aircraft will be delivered in the next 20 years, over 20% of
which will be delivered to the Mainland.    The principal lessee’s obligations are:
pay  rentals  and  any  maintenance  reserves  on  time  and  in  full;  operate  and
maintain  aircraft  in  accordance  with  regulations;  maintain  aircraft  to  the
maintenance  schedule  approved  by  the  lessor;  maintain  insurance  cover  at  all
times; ensure continuous possession of the aircraft; settle all invoices related to
the aircraft as they fall due; and return aircraft when and as agreed by the lessor.

3.
The core business model of an aircraft lessor is focused on purchasing
new, fuel-efficient, in-demand aircraft at competitive prices directly from aircraft
manufacturers, financing those aircraft purchases efficiently, placing the aircraft
on operating leases with a globally diversified customer base.    The three key
channels from  which lessors typically acquire aircraft are: direct from  OEMs;
purchase-leaseback; and secondary market.    In an operating lease, the risks and
rewards of the aircraft ownership sit with the lessor and the risks and rewards of
operation  remain  with  the  lessee.    In  essence,  the  lessee  (i.e.  the  aircraft
operator) pays the lessor (i.e. the owner of the aircraft) rental payments in order
to operate the leased aircraft over an agreed fixed term.

In the aircraft leasing industry, a special purpose vehicle (SPV), which
4.
is  a  corporation,  is  normally  used  to  hold  an  aircraft  as  owner  and  lessor  for
leasing.    Activities incidental to aircraft leasing, such as evaluation of aircraft
investment,  fund  raising,  procurement  of  aircraft,  soliciting  lessees,  etc.,  are
carried out by an aircraft leasing manager remunerated by a service fee.    The
contractual arrangements among the aircraft lessors, aircraft leasing manager and
aircraft operators are illustrated as follows:

5.
Hong  Kong  as  an  international  financial  centre  possesses  favourable
conditions  necessary  for  developing  aircraft  leasing  business,  namely  sound
legal  and  banking  systems,  well-developed  and  diversified  capital  markets,
excellent  aviation  infrastructure  and  talents,  and  proximity  to  the  Mainland
market.

6.
In April 2015, the Mainland and Hong Kong signed the Fourth Protocol
to the Double Taxation Arrangement between the Mainland of China and Hong
Kong  Special Administrative  Region,  which  reduced  the  withholding  tax  rate
from 7% to 5% on lease rentals paid to an aircraft and ship leasing business under
the Royalties Article.    This provides a solid foundation for Hong Kong to attract
aircraft lessors to domicile their leasing operations in Hong Kong.

2

In  July  2017,  the  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  (No.  3)  Ordinance
7.
2017  (the  2017 Amendment  (No.  3)  Ordinance)  was  enacted.    While  aircraft
lessors resident in Hong Kong continue to be denied depreciation allowance for
aircraft  leased  to  persons  who  are  not  operators  of  Hong  Kong  aircraft,  tax
concessions  are  given  in  respect  of  rentals  derived  from  such  aircraft  leasing
transactions.    In  effect,  the  gross  rental  income  after  deducting  allowable
expenses  is  taxed  at  a  tax  rate  comparable  to  rental  income  derived  from
operators of Hong Kong aircraft.

8.
The 2017 Amendment (No. 3) Ordinance provides a level playing field
for  aircraft  leasing  activities  with  persons  who  are  not  Hong  Kong  aircraft
operators  vis-à-vis  those  with  Hong  Kong  aircraft  operators.    With  the  tax
concessions,  the  way  has  been  paved  for  grasping  new  business  opportunities
from the Mainland market.    The purpose of this Note is to set out in detail the
Department’s views and practice on the tax concessions for qualifying aircraft
lessors and qualifying aircraft leasing managers.

The 2017 Amendment (No. 3) Ordinance

The 2017 Amendment (No. 3) Ordinance amended the Inland Revenue
9.
Ordinance  (the  Ordinance)  to  give  profits  tax  concessions  to  corporations
carrying on certain businesses in connection with aircraft and to make provisions
for  profits  tax  purposes  about  such  businesses.    The  main  provisions  are  as
follows:

Profits tax concessions for aircraft leasing

(a)

Section 14G is added to provide for the interpretation of terms
used in the provisions for the profits tax concessions, including
the  definitions  of  qualifying  aircraft  leasing  activity  and
qualifying aircraft leasing management activity.

(b)

Sections  14H  and  14I  are  added  to  provide  for  the  profits  tax
concessions for qualifying aircraft lessors –

(i)

Section  14H(1)  provides  that  a  corporation  that  is  a
qualifying  aircraft  lessor  for  a  year  of  assessment  is
entitled  to  have  its  profits  derived  from  its  qualifying

3

aircraft  leasing  activity  for  that  year  of  assessment
charged  at  one-half  the  profits  tax  rate  specified  in
Schedule 8 to the Ordinance (i.e. the concessionary rate).

(ii)

Section  14H(2)  and  (4)  provides  for  how  a  corporation
may  be  a  qualifying  aircraft  lessor  and  how  it  can  be
entitled to the concessionary rate.

(iii)  Section  14I  provides  that  if  the  profits  tax  concession
under section 14H applies to a corporation for a year of
assessment,  the  net  lease  payments  derived  from  its
qualifying aircraft leasing activity are to be calculated in
accordance  with  the  formula  set  out  in  section  14I(2).
The  effect  is  that  the  taxable  amount  of  the  lease
payments is to be equal to 20% of the tax base (i.e. gross
lease  payments  less  deductible  expenses,  excluding  tax
depreciation).

(c)

Section 14J is added to provide for the profits tax concession for
qualifying aircraft leasing managers –

(i)

Section  14J(1)  provides  that  a  corporation  that  is  a
qualifying  aircraft  leasing  manager  for  a  year  of
assessment is entitled to have its profits derived from its
qualifying  aircraft  leasing  management  activity  for  that
year of assessment charged at the concessionary rate.

(ii)

Section 14J(2) provides for how a corporation may be a
qualifying aircraft leasing manager, namely –

  by  satisfying  the  conditions  specified  in  section

14J(3);

  by satisfying the safe harbour rule under section 14K;

or

  by obtaining the determination of the Commissioner
of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) under section
14L.

4

(iii)    Section 14J(5) is added to provide for certain conditions

for the entitlement to the concessionary rate.

(d)

Section  14K  is  added  to  provide  for  how  a  corporation  may
satisfy  the  safe  harbour  rule.  There  are  two  alternative  safe
harbours –

(i)

(ii)

The “1-year safe harbour” in section 14K(2) requires the
corporation  to  satisfy  certain  conditions  regarding  its
aircraft  leasing  management  profits  and  aircraft  leasing
management assets for the year of assessment concerned.

The  “multiple-year  safe  harbour”  in  section  14K(3)
requires the corporation to satisfy similar conditions for
the year of assessment concerned and the preceding one
or two years of assessment.

(e)

(f)

Section  14L  is  added  to  provide  for  the  Commissioner’s
discretion to make a determination that a corporation, which is
not otherwise qualified, is a qualifying aircraft leasing manager.

Section  14M  is  added  to  provide  for  anti-abuse  measures  for
preventing avoidance of profits tax by means of the profits tax
concessions granted to qualifying aircraft lessors and qualifying
aircraft leasing managers.

(g)

Section 14N is added to empower the Commissioner to amend,
by order published in the Gazette, Schedule 17F.

(h)    Section 19CA is amended to cover the trading receipts in respect
of  which  assessable  profits  are  chargeable  to  tax  at  the
concessionary rate under section 14H or 14J.

(i)

Schedule  17F  is  added  to  define  aircraft  leasing  activity  and
aircraft leasing management activity and specify the prescribed
percentages relating to the calculation of net lease payments and
the safe harbour rule.

5

Gains or profits arising through or from aircraft business

(j)

Section 15(1)(n) is added to make it clear that sums received by
or accrued to a corporation from carrying on certain businesses
in connection with aircraft as having a Hong Kong source, even
if the aircraft are used outside Hong Kong.

Anti-tax arbitrage provision

(k)

Section 16(1A) is added to prevent tax arbitrage through aircraft
leasing transactions between connected persons.

Notional depreciation allowances

(l)

Sections  37,  38,  39B  and  39D  are  amended  to  deal  with
computation of the cost and capital expenditure in relation to an
aircraft that is used by a corporation for carrying out a qualifying
aircraft  leasing  activity  before  being  used  in  another  trade,
profession or business.

QUALIFYING AIRCRAFT LESSOR

Concession for qualifying aircraft lessor

While  section  14H  contains  the  specific  provisions  relating  to  the
10.
profits tax concession for qualifying aircraft lessors, the charging provisions in
section 14 for profits tax continue to be applicable.    Thus, a qualifying aircraft
lessor  is  chargeable  to  profits  tax  under  section  14  since  it  is  carrying  on  an
aircraft leasing business in Hong Kong.

11.
By virtue of the provision in section 14H(1), a qualifying aircraft lessor
is  entitled  to  have  its  qualifying  profits  charged  at  one-half  of  the  corporate
profits tax rate.    Qualifying profits would include income incidental to profits
from an aircraft leasing business, like interest income, exchange gains or hedging
gains, as long as the transactions are ancillary to the qualifying activities.    The
half rate concession applies to a qualifying aircraft lessor for a year of assessment
only if:

6

(a)

in that year of assessment –

(i)

(ii)

the central management and control of the corporation is
exercised in Hong Kong (the central management and
control requirement);

the  activities  that  produce  its  qualifying  profits  in  that
year are carried out in Hong Kong by the corporation; or
arranged  by  the  corporation  to  be  carried  out  in  Hong
Kong (the substantial activity requirement); and

(iii)

those  activities  are  not  carried  out  by  a  permanent
establishment  outside  Hong  Kong  (the  attribution  to
Hong Kong requirement); and

(b)

the  corporation  has  made  an  election  in  writing,  which  is
irrevocable, that the half rate concession applies to it.

The  word  “aircraft”  under  this  concessionary  tax  regime  has  a  wide
12.
meaning.    Section  14G(1)  stipulates  that  “aircraft”  includes  an  aeroplane,
airframe, aircraft engine and helicopter; but does not include an aircraft solely
for military use, airship, spacecraft or satellite.    Thus, this regime would cover
leasing of standalone aircraft engines.

Under section 14H(2), a corporation is a qualifying aircraft lessor for a

13.
year of assessment if, in the basis period for that year of assessment:

(a)

it is not an aircraft operator;

(b)

(c)

it has carried out in Hong Kong one or more qualifying aircraft
leasing activities; and

it  has  not  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong  any  activity  other  than  a
qualifying aircraft leasing activity.

An  aircraft  operator  is  not  eligible  to  be  a  qualifying  aircraft  lessor.
14.
The term “aircraft operator” is defined in section 14G(1) as a person carrying on

7

an aircraft operation business which means a business of operating aircraft as an
owner or a charterer for providing services for the carriage by air of passengers,
cargo  or  mail;  but  does  not  include  dealing  in  aircraft  or  agency  business  in
connection with air transport.    In effect, all aircraft operators are excluded from
this preferential tax regime.    The qualifying aircraft lessor under section 14H(2)
must be a standalone corporation engaging solely in qualifying aircraft leasing
activities.    This standalone condition is consistent with the industry practice of
using SPVs to hold aircraft for leasing.

15.
For the purpose of determining whether a corporation has carried out
any  activity  other  than  a  qualifying  aircraft  leasing  activity,  only  activities  that
generate income to the corporation are to be taken into account as explained in
section  14H(3).    That  means  expense  transactions  would  be  excluded.    For
example,  taking  a  lease  in  respect  of  the  business  premises  for  carrying  out
qualifying  aircraft  leasing  activities  or  sponsoring  an  international  industry
conference for marketing purpose would not preclude a corporation from being a
qualifying aircraft lessor since the corporation would only incur rental expenses
or sponsorship expenses in these transactions which do not generate income.

20% tax base concession

16.
As  a  compensation  for  loss  of  depreciation  allowances,  a  qualifying
aircraft lessor is eligible for a 20% tax base concession.    Section 14I(1) and (2)
provides  that if the  half rate concession applies to a qualifying aircraft lessor,
then the net lease payments for the right to use an aircraft under a lease that are
to be included in the assessable profits derived from its qualifying aircraft leasing
activity would be computed in accordance with the following formula:

A = (B – C) × D

where:  A  means the net lease payments;

B  means the aggregate amount of the gross lease payments
(whether or not they are periodic payments and including
any sum payable under a residual value guarantee) earned
by or accrued to the qualifying aircraft lessor under the
lease during the basis period for the year of assessment;

8

C  means  the  aggregate  amount  of  any  outgoings  and
expenses deductible under Part 4 of the Ordinance to the
extent to which they are incurred during the basis period
for the year of assessment by the qualifying aircraft lessor
in the production of those gross lease payments (relevant
outgoings and expenses); and

D  means the percentage prescribed in section 2 of Schedule

17F (i.e. 20%).

17.
Such 20% tax base concession would not apply to a qualifying aircraft
lessor  for  a  year  of  assessment  in  the  following  circumstances  under  section
14I(3):

(a)

lessor  has  not

The  qualifying  aircraft
incurred  capital
expenditure  on  the  provision  of  the  aircraft  concerned.    The
term “capital expenditure” would include payments incurred for
the purpose of obtaining ownership of an aircraft via a funding
lease, a hire-purchase agreement or a conditional sale agreement.

(b)  Depreciation  allowances  under  Part  6  of  the  Ordinance  have
been  granted  to  the  qualifying  aircraft  lessor  or  its  connected
person  in  respect  of  the  capital  expenditure  incurred  on  the
provision  of  the  aircraft  concerned.
  For  example,  if  a
qualifying aircraft lessor previously leased an aircraft to a Hong
Kong aircraft operator in respect of which it had been granted
depreciation allowances, that lessor could not be entitled to the
20% tax base concession even if it elects into the aircraft leasing
regime  afterwards.    Only  half  rate  concession  would  be
granted to it.

(c)

Capital  allowances  are  granted  to  a  connected  person  of  the
qualifying aircraft lessor, whether in Hong Kong or in a territory
outside Hong Kong, for that year of assessment in respect of the
capital expenditure on the provision of the aircraft concerned.

9

The  term  “connected  person”  is  defined  in  section  14G(1).    The  purpose  of
section 14I(3) is to prevent a qualifying aircraft lessor and its connected person
from  obtaining  double  benefits  where  they  could  obtain  both  the  capital
allowances in respect of the aircraft concerned and the 20% tax base concession
which is actually a compensation for such allowances.    Double dip should be
disallowed.

If  an  aircraft  is  leased  to  an  aircraft  operator  together  with  other
18.
the
in  pursuance  of  one  bargain,  section  14I(4)  empowers
dealings
Commissioner to allocate an amount of gross lease payments for the right to use
the aircraft under the lease having regard to all the circumstances of the bargain.
The  term  “bargain”  is  defined  in  Shorter  Oxford  English  Dictionary  as
“discussion between two parties over terms”.    Section 14I(4) would apply if the
terms of the lease and other dealings are negotiated together such that the gross
lease payments would not reflect the market rental of the aircraft.

Example 1

In  a  sale  and  leaseback  transaction,  an  aircraft  operator  sold  an
aircraft to a qualifying aircraft lessor at a deflated price.    In return, it
could  lease  back  the  aircraft  from  the  qualifying  aircraft  lessor  at  a
deflated monthly lease payment for a fixed period of time.

Since  the  sale  price  of  the  aircraft  and  gross  lease  payments  are
negotiated  together  in  pursuance  of  one  bargain,  the  Commissioner
could adjust the gross lease payments under section 14I(4).

Section 14I(5) specifies that if the 20% tax base concession applies, the
19.
relevant outgoings and expenses that are incurred for the production of the gross
lease  payments  may  not  be  claimed  for  deduction  under  profits  tax  otherwise
than for calculating the net lease payments under section 14I(2).    Thus, all the
relevant  outgoings  and  expenses  must  be  netted  off  from  the  gross  lease
payments before applying the 20% tax base concession.    Such outgoings and
expenses could not be claimed for deduction against other income.

10

Irrevocable election

Before the half rate concession applies, the qualifying aircraft lessor
20.
has to make an election.    Such election must be made in writing (e.g. in a tax
return) as required by section 14H(4)(b).    Once made, the provision in section
14H(5) makes it irrevocable.    Thus, a qualifying aircraft lessor does not need to
make an election for every year of assessment in which it is entitled to the half
rate concession.

21.
Under  section  14H(6)(a),  if  section  14H(1)  no  longer  applies  to  a
qualifying aircraft lessor, then the election previously  made by it ceases to be
effective.    In  case  the  qualifying  aircraft  lessor  is  entitled  to  the  half  rate
concession again, it is required to make a fresh election.

AIRCRAFT LEASING ACTIVITY

Definition of aircraft leasing activity

“Aircraft leasing activity” is defined in section 1(1) of Schedule 17F as
22.
leasing an aircraft by a corporation to an aircraft operator.    The aircraft must be
leased  to  an  aircraft  operator,  whether  in  Hong  Kong  or  elsewhere.    In
commercial  practice,  an  intermediate  lessor  may  be  interposed  between  the
corporation  and  the  aircraft  operator  for  various  reasons,  such  as  meeting
requirements on aircraft registration.    The intermediate lessor may be a related
company of either the corporation or the aircraft operator.    The Commissioner
would carefully examine the facts, including any tax motives to avoid taxes, to
ascertain  whether  such  an  arrangement  should  be  eligible  for  the  profits  tax
concessions.

Definition of lease

The term “lease” in section 14G(1), when used as a noun, is defined as
23.
a dry lease; but does not include a dry lease that is a funding lease, hire-purchase
agreement or conditional sale agreement.    When the term is used as a verb, it is
to be construed accordingly.    “Dry lease” means an arrangement under which:

11

(a)

an aircraft is bona fide demised, let or hired out, or a right to use
an aircraft is otherwise granted, by the lessor to another person
for a term exceeding 1 year;

(b)

the lessor is not responsible for ensuring the airworthiness of the
aircraft; and

(c)

no member of the crew of the aircraft is employed by the lessor.

In the leasing industry, a dry lease means a lease of the aircraft, not including
crew, insurance and maintenance whereas a wet lease is a typically short term
lease for seasonal needs including the aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance
during the period of the lease.    The words “bona fide” in the above definition
of “dry lease” are intended to require that the leasing arrangement is based on
the honest intention of the lessor, rather than a means to escape the strict liability
under  the  Civil  Aviation  Ordinance  (Cap.  448).
  All  forms  of  leasing
arrangements are covered.    Aircraft leasing involves complicated commercial
arrangements and takes various forms, including a demise charter whereby the
aircraft  operator  has  the  possession  and  control  of  the  aircraft  and  the  lessor
remains the owner.    Given the definition of “lease”, only dry leases are covered
by the profits tax concessions and wet leases are excluded.

Financiers are prevented from repackaging secured loans into aircraft
24.
leases to obtain the profits tax concessions since funding leases, hire-purchase
agreements  or  conditional  sale  agreements  are  not  regarded  as  leases.    If  an
aircraft  lessor  grants  a  right  to  use  an  aircraft  to  an  aircraft  operator  under  a
funding  lease,  hire-purchase  agreement  or  conditional  sale  agreement,  the
ownership of the aircraft in effect is transferred to the aircraft operator and profits
tax concession will not be given.

Funding lease

Funding lease, as defined in section 14G(1), means a dry lease of an

25.
aircraft:

(a)

that satisfies one of the following conditions at its inception –

(i)

the dry lease is accounted for as a finance lease or loan

12

by the lessor in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial
Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute
of  Certified  Public  Accountants  or  the  International
Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International
Accounting  Standards  Board,  as  in  force  from  time  to
time;

(ii)

the  present  value  of  the  aggregate  minimum  lease
payments (whether or not they are periodic payments and
including  any  sum  payable  under  a  residual  value
guarantee) during the term of the dry lease is equal to or
more than 80% of the fair market value of the aircraft;

(iii)

the term of the dry lease is equal to or more than 65% of
the remaining useful economic life of the aircraft; and

(b)

under which the property in the aircraft will or may pass to the
lessee at the end of its term,

and includes an arrangement or agreement in connection with such a
dry lease.

In a funding lease, all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of
26.
an  aircraft  are  substantially  transferred  to  the  lessee  and  the  property  in  the
aircraft would pass to the lessee at the end of the lease.    In substance, a funding
lease is a financing arrangement under which the lessee is transferred the risks
and rewards of the aircraft ownership and the aircraft lessor is the financier.

Example 2

Aircraft Lessor-HK leased an aircraft to Aircraft Operator-F for a term
of  12  years  under  a  dry  lease.    The  lease  was  accounted  for  as  a
finance  lease  according  to  the  Hong  Kong  Financial  Reporting
Standards.    At the end of the lease term, the property in the aircraft
would not pass to Aircraft Operator-F.

The lease would not be regarded as a funding lease since the property
in the aircraft would not pass to the aircraft operator at the end of the
lease  term.    If  other  requirements  are  fulfilled, Aircraft  Lessor-HK
would be entitled to the profits tax concessions.

13

The term “funding  lease” has been defined in connection  with  a dry
27.
lease which satisfies certain conditions.    The definition is extended to include
an arrangement or agreement in connection with such a dry lease of an aircraft.
Thus, any separate arrangement or agreement like purchase option agreement or
rental rebate agreement may be regarded as forming part of the lease and will be
taken  into  account  when  determining  whether  the  lease  together  with  the
arrangement  or  agreement  is  a  funding  lease.    If  a  purchase  option  merely
allows the lessee to acquire the property in the aircraft at its fair market value at
the  end  of  the  lease  term,  it  would  be  treated  as  a  separate  transaction  not
connected with the dry lease.    If the rental rebate received upon the aircraft’s
disposal represents no more than the costs of arranging a sale of the aircraft (e.g.
a commission at market rate), it would be regarded as a separate transaction not
connected with the dry lease.    In short, the Commissioner has to decide whether
the property in the aircraft, whether in form and in substance, will or may pass
to the lessee at the end of the lease term.

Example 3

Aircraft Lessor-HK and Aircraft Operator-F entered into a dry lease
under which Aircraft Operator-F was granted a right to use an aircraft
for a term of 20 years.    The aircraft had a useful economic life of 22
years.    By a separate agreement, Aircraft Lessor-HK allowed Aircraft
Operator-F  to  acquire  the  aircraft  at  market  price  at  the  end  of  the
lease  term  or  to  sell  the  aircraft  to  a  third  party  on  its  behalf.
Proceeds  from  sale  would  be  paid  to  Aircraft  Operator-F  as  rental
rebates.

The lease term was more than 65% of the remaining useful economic
life of the aircraft.    Though no purchase option was provided under
the lease agreement, Aircraft Operator-F would be allowed to acquire
the  property  in  the  aircraft  concerned  or  the  risks  and  rewards
associated  with  the  ownership  of  such  an  aircraft  at  no  additional
consideration  under  another  separate  agreement  which  was  an
arrangement  or  agreement  in  connection  with  the  dry  lease.    In  the
circumstances, the dry lease would be a funding lease not eligible for
the profits tax concessions.

14

Example 4

Aircraft Lessor-HK and Aircraft Operator-F entered into a dry lease
under which Aircraft Operator-F was allowed to use an aircraft for a
term of 8 years.    The present value of the aggregate minimum lease
payments was more than 80% of the fair market value of the aircraft.
Under a separate purchase option agreement, SPV-F which was wholly
owned  or  controlled  by  Aircraft  Operator-F  would  be  allowed  to
acquire the property in the aircraft at a nominal price of $100.

The present value of the aggregate minimum lease payments was more
than 80% of the fair market value of the aircraft.    SPV-F was allowed
to acquire the aircraft at a nominal price at the end of the lease term
under  a  purchase  option  agreement  which  was  an  arrangement  or
agreement in connection with the dry lease.    Though the property in
the aircraft would not pass to Aircraft Operator-F, the apparent intent
was  that  SPV-F,  wholly  owned  or  controlled  by Aircraft  Operator-F,
would acquire the property in the aircraft at the end of the lease term.
Given  such  facts,  the  Commissioner  would  invoke  the  provisions  in
section  61A  to  treat  the  dry  lease  together  with  the  purchase  option
agreement as a funding lease.    Therefore, no profits tax concessions
could be granted.

28.
The provisions in section 14G(3) and (4) are aimed to prevent aircraft
lessors from splitting a funding lease into various short-term leases so as to be
eligible  for  the  profits  tax  concessions.    If,  under  two  or  more  dry  leases,  an
aircraft  is  demised,  let  or  hired  out,  or  a  right  to  use  an  aircraft  is  otherwise
granted to a corporation and/or its associates, regardless of whether the term of
one of the dry leases is immediately followed by that of another, the dry leases
are to be treated as one single dry lease:

(a)

for computing the present value of the aggregate minimum lease
payments; and

(b)

for computing the term of the dry lease.

Since  an  aircraft  lessor  may  renew  an  operating  lease  with  the  same  aircraft
operator after the expiration of the lease, section 14G(3) provides that the dry

15

leases  would  not  be  treated  as  a  single  lease  if,  in  the  opinion  of  the
Commissioner,  they  do  not  form  part  of  a  single  arrangement.    That  means
successive genuine operating leases would not be regarded as one single funding
lease.

Example 5

Aircraft  Lessor-HK  and  Aircraft  Operator-F  entered  into  four
continuous  dry  lease  agreements  at  the  same  time.    Under  the  four
lease  agreements,  each  with  a  lease  term  of  five  years,  an  aircraft
having  a  remaining  useful  economic  life  of  22  years  was  leased  to
Aircraft Operator-F.    That is, the aircraft would be leased to Aircraft
Operator-F for a total of 20 years.    Under the last agreement, Aircraft
Operator-F  was  able  to  acquire  under  an  option  the  property  in  the
aircraft at a nominal price of $100 at the end of the lease term.

The four dry lease agreements constitute a single leasing arrangement.
By virtue of section 14G(3) and (4), the dry leases should be treated as
one single dry lease for the purpose of computing the term of the dry
lease.    Since the aggregate length of the  lease terms was  more than
65%  of  the  remaining  useful  economic  life  of  the  aircraft  and  the
property  in  the  aircraft  would  likely  pass  to Aircraft  Operator-F,  the
four dry leases would be regarded as a single funding lease.    Aircraft
Lessor-HK  would  not  be  entitled  to  the  profits  tax  concessions  in
respect of the four dry leases.

Example 6

Aircraft Lessor-HK leased an aircraft to Aircraft Operator-HK for a term
of 8 years.    The aircraft had a useful economic life of 20 years.    After 8
years, Aircraft Operator-HK exercised an option to renew the lease for
another 5 years at the prevailing market rent.    As a result, the aircraft
would be leased to Aircraft Operator-HK for a total of 13 years which
equalled 65% of the remaining useful economic life of the aircraft.

In the absence of any tax avoidance motives, the two lease agreements
would not be regarded as constituting one single leasing arrangement.
The terms of the two lease agreements would not be aggregated for the
purpose of ascertaining whether they should be regarded as a funding
lease.

16

Hire-purchase agreement and conditional sale agreement

The terms “hire-purchase agreement” and “conditional sale agreement”
29.
are defined in section 2 of the Ordinance.    “Hire-purchase agreement” means
an  agreement  for  the  bailment  of  goods  under  which  the  bailee  may  buy  the
goods, or under which the property in the goods will or may pass to the bailee.
“Conditional sale agreement” means an agreement for the sale of goods under
which the purchase price or part of the purchase price is payable by instalments,
and  the  property  in  the  goods  remains  in  the  seller  (notwithstanding  that  the
buyer is to be in possession of the goods) until such conditions as to the payment
of instalments or otherwise as may be specified in the agreement are fulfilled.
The  bailee  is  given  a  purchase  option  under  a  hire-purchase  agreement  while
transfer  of  title  is  conditional  upon  full  payment  of  purchase  price  or  other
conditions (i.e. retention of title) under a conditional sale agreement.    Similar
to a funding lease, these financing agreements transfer substantially all the risks
and rewards incidental to ownership of an aircraft to the bailee or buyer.    The
aircraft lessor is no more than a financier if the aircraft is leased to an aircraft
operator by way of these financing agreements which do not fall within the scope
of the profits tax concessions.

Qualifying aircraft leasing activity

Under  section  14G(6),  an  aircraft  leasing  activity  carried  out  by  a

30.
corporation in respect of an aircraft is a qualifying aircraft leasing activity if:

(a)

(b)

the  activity  is  carried  out  in  the  ordinary  course  of  the
corporation’s business carried on in Hong Kong; and

the  aircraft  is  owned  by  the  corporation  when  the  activity  is
carried out.

In the ordinary course of business

The  aircraft  leasing  activities  have  to  be  carried  out  in  the  ordinary
31.
course  of  the  qualifying  aircraft  lessor’s  business.
  As  such,  artificial
transactions structured with a view to shifting profits from other tax jurisdictions
would  not  qualify  for  the  profits  tax  concessions.    The  Commissioner  would
examine the terms of the lease agreement, financing arrangement and all other

17

relevant circumstances to determine if the aircraft leasing activities are carried
out  bona  fide  in  the  ordinary  course  of  the  aircraft  lessor’s  business  in  Hong
Kong.

Ownership requirement

The aircraft has  to be  owned by  the  qualifying aircraft lessor.    This
32.
requirement is to prevent treaty shopping through sub-leasing and to comply with
the  latest  international  standards  to  combat  base  erosion  and  profit  shifting
(BEPS).    The qualifying aircraft lessor is expected to have substantial activities
in Hong Kong, performing the relevant functions, using the relevant assets and
assuming the relevant risks associated with the ownership of the aircraft.    The
word “own” in section 14G(1) normally refers to economic ownership.    Thus,
holding the aircraft in the following capacities is covered:

(a)

as a lessee under a funding lease;

(b)

as a bailee under a hire-purchase agreement; and

(c)

as a buyer under a conditional sale agreement.

In substance, funding lease, hire-purchase agreement and conditional
33.
sale agreement are financing arrangements whereby the lessee, bailee and buyer
are  the  economic  owner  of  the  aircraft.    The  word  “own”  is  defined  to
incorporate  these  financing  arrangements.    If  the  aircraft  lessor  acquires  an
aircraft  through  these  financing  arrangements,  the  ownership  of  the  aircraft
would be regarded as having been acquired by the aircraft lessor even though
legal title to the aircraft has not yet been transferred to the aircraft lessor.

34.
It is made explicitly clear in section 14G(5) that in the definitions of
“lease” and “own”, a reference to a funding lease, hire-purchase agreement or
conditional sale agreement does not include one under which, in the opinion of
the Commissioner, the property in the aircraft concerned would reasonably be
expected not to pass to the lessee, bailee or buyer, as the case may be.    Therefore,
if the property in the aircraft is expected not to pass to the aircraft operator, such
a funding lease, hire-purchase agreement or conditional sale agreement may be
treated as a lease.

18

If  the  aircraft  lessor  acquires  an  aircraft  under  a  funding  lease,  hire-
35.
purchase agreement or conditional sale agreement and the property in the aircraft
would unlikely pass to the aircraft lessor, the aircraft would not be regarded as
having been acquired by the aircraft lessor.    Thus, leasing of such an aircraft to
an aircraft operator would fall outside the definition of qualifying aircraft leasing
activity and no profits tax concessions could be granted to the aircraft lessor.

36.
Besides financing arrangements, there has been an increase in the use
of  bare  trust  arrangements  under  which  the  trustee  merely  holds  the  legal
ownership  of  an  aircraft  while  the  lessor  possesses  the  beneficial  (economic)
ownership  of  the  aircraft.    Such  an  arrangement  is  becoming  increasingly
popular as it facilitates the trade of the leased aircraft by transfer of beneficial
ownership, without the necessity to novate the underlying lease.

37.
Provided  that  other  relevant  conditions  are  satisfied  and  the  trustee
merely  acts  as  the  registered  or  bare  legal  owner  of  the  aircraft,  a  qualifying
aircraft lessor, being the beneficial owner of the aircraft, will be entitled to the
tax concession despite that the aircraft is held by a trustee in trust for the lessor.
A typical trust arrangement is explained in Appendix 1.

Example 7

Trustee-HK, as a trustee, holds an aircraft in trust for Aircraft Lessor-
HK pursuant to a trust arrangement.    On behalf of Aircraft  Lessor-
HK,  Trustee-HK  grants  the  right  to  use  the  aircraft  to  Aircraft
Operator-HK  under  a  lease.    The  trust  instrument  provides  that  all
right, title and interest in and to the aircraft, the lease and any other
documents  in  connection  therewith  belong  to  Aircraft  Lessor-HK.
Other than the bare legal ownership to the aircraft, Trustee HK has no
beneficial, equitable or other interest in the aircraft, the lease or any
  All  amounts  of  rent,
other  documents  in  connection  therewith.
security deposits, proceeds of sale and other amounts in respect of the
operating  lease  or  the  aircraft  received  by  Trustee-HK  will  be
distributed  promptly  to  Aircraft  Lessor-HK.    Trustee-HK  has  no
power  or  authority  to  deal  with  the  aircraft,  the  lease  or  any  other
documents in connection therewith except as provided in instructions
or authorisation from Aircraft Lessor-HK.

19

Aircraft  Lessor-HK  would  be  regarded  as  the  owner  of  the  aircraft.
Provided that other relevant conditions are satisfied, Aircraft Lessor-
HK could be entitled to the profits tax concessions under the aircraft
lessor regime.

Transaction structuring

38.
Under  the  Convention  on  International  Civil  Aviation  1944  (the
Chicago Convention), an aircraft is required to be registered with a national civil
aviation authority which operates either an operator-based registry or an owner-
based registry.    If it is an owner-based registry (e.g. Japan and the United States),
an SPV is often set up in that jurisdiction to hold the legal title of the aircraft
while  the  lessor  retains  economic  ownership  of  the  aircraft.      The  aircraft
operated by an aircraft operator resident in a jurisdiction may be registered in
another jurisdiction so as to reduce risks of repossession.    Further, to secure a
cheaper  source  of  funding  for  financing  the  acquisition  of  an  aircraft,  export
guaranteed financing and tax based structures may be required.

39.

Common transaction structures include:

(a)

Japanese conditional sale structure;

(b)  Russian lease-in-lease-out structure;

(c)

ECA/US EXIM guaranteed or supported financing;

(d)

French or Japanese tax lease financing; or

(e)

securitisation.

In  these  cross-border  transactions,  an  SPV  may  be  interposed  so  as  to  fulfil
specific objectives, to isolate financial risks or to allow for easier transfer of the
aircraft.    If properly structured, the ownership requirement in section 14G(6)(b)
will be regarded as having been satisfied.    These structures, together with other
business  models,  explained  in Appendix  2  are  for  illustration  purposes  only.
The application of the law may differ depending on the facts of each case.

QUALIFYING AIRCRAFT LEASING MANAGER

Concession for qualifying aircraft leasing manager

40.
While section 14J contains the specific provisions relating to the profits
tax concession for qualifying aircraft leasing managers, the charging provisions
in  section  14  for  profits  tax  continue  to  be  applicable.    Thus,  a  qualifying
aircraft leasing manager is chargeable to profits tax under section 14 since it is
carrying on an aircraft leasing management business in Hong Kong.    By virtue
of the provision in section 14J(1), a qualifying aircraft leasing manager is entitled
to have its qualifying profits charged at one-half of the corporate profits tax rate.
The qualifying profits would include income incidental to profits from an aircraft
leasing management business, like interest income, exchange gains or hedging
gains, as long as the transactions are ancillary to the qualifying activities.    The
half rate concession applies to a qualifying aircraft leasing manager for a year of
assessment only if:

(a)

in that year of assessment –

(i)

(ii)

the central management and control of the corporation is
exercised in Hong Kong (the central management and
control requirement);

the  activities  that  produce  its  qualifying  profits  in  that
year are carried out in Hong Kong by the corporation; or
arranged  by  the  corporation  to  be  carried  out  in  Hong
Kong (the substantial activity requirement); and

(iii)

those  activities  are  not  carried  out  by  a  permanent
establishment  outside  Hong  Kong  (the  attribution  to
Hong Kong requirement); and

(b)

the  corporation  has  made  an  election  in  writing,  which  is
irrevocable, that the half rate concession applies to it.

21

Under  section  14J(2),  a  corporation  is  a  qualifying  aircraft  leasing

41.
manager for a year of assessment if:

(a)

in the basis period for that year of assessment, it is not an aircraft
operator; and

(b)

for that year of assessment:

(i)

(ii)

it is a dedicated aircraft leasing manager in section 14J(3)
that has satisfied the standalone corporation requirement;

it is an aircraft leasing manager that has satisfied the “1-
year safe harbour” rule or the “multiple-year safe harbour”
rule  in  section  14K  though  it  has  carried  out  in  Hong
Kong  activities  other  than  a  qualifying  aircraft  leasing
management activity; or

(iii)

it is an aircraft leasing manager that has been determined
by  the  Commissioner  under  section  14L(1)  as  a
qualifying  aircraft  leasing  manager  though  it  satisfies
neither of the conditions in (i) and (ii) above.

Dedicated aircraft leasing manager

The conditions specified in section 14J(3) are that, in the basis period

42.
for the year of assessment, the corporation:

(a)

(b)

has  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong  one  or  more  qualifying  aircraft
leasing management activities; and

has  not  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong  any  activity  other  than  a
qualifying aircraft leasing management activity.

Similar to a qualifying aircraft lessor, only a standalone corporate entity carrying
on the business as an aircraft leasing manager and engaging solely in qualifying
aircraft  leasing  management  activities  can  be  a  qualifying  aircraft  leasing
manager.    Section  14J(4)  provides  that  in  determining  whether  a  corporation
has carried out any activity other than a qualifying aircraft leasing management

22

activity, only activities that generate income to the corporation are to be taken
into account.

Irrevocable election

Before the half rate concession applies, the qualifying aircraft leasing
43.
manager has to make an election.    Such election must be made in writing (e.g.
in a tax return) as required by section 14J(5)(b).    Once made, the provision in
section 14J(6) makes it irrevocable.    Thus, a qualifying aircraft leasing manager
does not need to make an election for every  year of assessment in  which it is
entitled to the half rate concession.

44.
Under  section  14J(7)(a),  if  section  14J(1)  no  longer  applies  to  a
qualifying  aircraft  leasing  manager,  then  the  election  previously  made  by  it
ceases to be effective.    In case the qualifying aircraft leasing manager is entitled
to the half rate concession again, it is required to make a fresh election.

Aircraft leasing management activity

Section  1(1)  of  Schedule  17F  defines  “aircraft  leasing  management

45.
activity”, in relation to a corporation, as any of the following activities:

(a)  managing a qualifying aircraft lessor;

(b)

(c)

(d)

establishment or administration of a special purpose entity for
the purpose of owning an aircraft by that entity;

providing finance in obtaining the ownership of an aircraft by a
special purpose entity wholly or partly owned by the corporation
or its associated corporation;

providing  a  guarantee  in  respect  of  a  financial  or  performance
obligation as regards the aircraft leasing business of a special purpose
entity  wholly  or  partly  owned  by  the  corporation  or  its  associated
corporation, or granting security in respect of that business;

(e)  managing leases;

(f)

arranging for the procurement or leasing of aircraft;

23

(g)

(h)

(i)

arranging  for  the  operation,  maintenance,  repair,  insurance,
storage, scrapping or modification of aircraft;

arranging for the evaluation, appraisal, provision or inspection
of aircraft, airline facilities or maintenance facilities for aircraft;

arranging for the assessment of the aviation and aircraft market
conditions;

(j)  marketing of leases that are operating leases;

(k)

(l)

providing finance in obtaining the ownership of an aircraft by
an airline enterprise from a qualifying aircraft lessor;

providing  a  residual  value  guarantee  or  contingent  purchase
arrangement;

(m)

providing services in relation to an aircraft leasing activity for
or to a qualifying aircraft lessor.

46.
Residual value guarantee or contingent purchase arrangement may be
provided by an aircraft leasing manager so as to reduce the risk of the lessor in
respect  of  the  residual  value  of  the  aircraft  at  the  end  of  the  lease  term  or  its
useful  economic  life.    The  term  “residual  value  guarantee”,  in  relation  to  an
aircraft, is defined in section 14G(1) as a financial commitment to pay a sum by
reference  to  the  amount  by  which  the  estimated  residual  value  of  the  aircraft
exceeds the actual residual value of the aircraft.    By virtue of section 1(3) of
Schedule  17F,  the  term  “contingent  purchase  arrangement”  means  an
arrangement under which a person is required to purchase an aircraft at a pre-
determined amount if the actual residual value falls below the estimated residual
value.

47.
When  a  qualifying  aircraft  leasing  manager,  at  the  request  of  a
qualifying aircraft lessor, provides finance to an airline enterprise for acquiring an
aircraft from the qualifying aircraft lessor, the qualifying aircraft leasing manager is
assisting  the  qualifying  aircraft  lessor  to  dispose  of  its  aircraft.    Such  activity  is
regarded as having been carried out for the qualifying aircraft lessor and would qualify
for the profits tax concession if other criteria are satisfied.

24

The expression “services in relation to an aircraft leasing activity for
48.
or to another corporation that is a relevant qualifying aircraft lessor” is wide in
its meaning.    It would include provision of services to qualifying aircraft lessors
in  connection  with  repossession  of  aircraft  and  remarketing  of  aircraft.    It
would also cover provision of advice on the disposals of aircraft.

Qualifying aircraft leasing management activity

Under section 14G(7), an aircraft leasing management activity carried
49.
out  by  a  corporation  in  respect  of  an  aircraft  is  a  qualifying  aircraft  leasing
management activity if:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the  activity  is  carried  out  in  the  ordinary  course  of  the
corporation’s business carried on in Hong Kong;

the  activity  is  carried  out  for  another  corporation  in  the  basis
period of the other corporation for a year of assessment;

the other corporation is a qualifying aircraft lessor for that year
of assessment; and

the aircraft is owned by the other corporation, and is leased to
an aircraft operator, when the activity is carried out.

50.
Since  an  aircraft  lessor  is  usually  an  SPV  holding  an  aircraft,  the
aircraft leasing management activity has to be carried out by an aircraft leasing
manager.    Thus,  the  qualifying  aircraft  lessor  and  qualifying  aircraft  leasing
manager  become  parties  privy  to  an  aircraft  leasing  arrangement.    The
qualifying  aircraft  leasing  management  activity  must  be  carried  out  for  a
qualifying  aircraft  lessor,  in  respect  of  an  aircraft  owned  by  the  qualifying
aircraft lessor, in the ordinary course of the business carried on by the qualifying
aircraft leasing manager in Hong Kong.

Safe harbour rule

51.
Section  14K  lays  down  the  safe  harbour  rule,  which  seeks  to  allow
corporations having profits and assets primarily for qualifying aircraft leasing
management activities to be entitled to the half rate concession in respect of the
qualifying profits.    There are two alternative safe harbours:

25

(a)  A corporation falls within the “1-year safe harbour” in section
14K(2) if, for the year of assessment concerned, the percentages
of  its  aircraft  leasing  management  profits  (ALMP  percentage)
and aircraft leasing management assets (ALMA percentage) are
not lower than the prescribed percentages as set out in sections
3 and 4 of Schedule 17F ( i.e. 75%);

(b)  A  corporation  falls  within  the  “multiple-year  safe  harbour”  in
section 14K(3) if, for the year of assessment concerned and the
preceding  one  or  two  years  of  assessment,  the  average
percentages  of  its  aircraft  leasing  management  profits  and
aircraft  leasing  management  assets  are  not  lower  than  the
prescribed percentages as set out in sections 3 and 4 of Schedule
17F (i.e. 75%).

52.

The  ALMP  and  ALMA  percentages  of  a  corporation  for  a  year  of

assessment are calculated in accordance with the following formulas in section

14K(5) and (6):

(a)  ALMP percentage

ALMP
P

where:  ALMP  means  the  aggregate  amount  of  the  aircraft
leasing  management
the
corporation in the basis period for the year of
assessment; and

profits

of

P

means  the  aggregate  amount  of  profits
accruing to the corporation from all sources,
whether  in  Hong  Kong  or  not,  in  the  basis
period for the year of assessment.

26

(b)  ALMA percentage

ALMA
A

where:  ALMA  means  the  aggregate  value  of  the  aircraft
leasing  management
the
corporation as at the end of the basis period
for the year of assessment; and

assets

of

A

means  the  aggregate  value  of  all  assets,
whether  in  Hong  Kong  or  not,  of  the
corporation as at the end of the basis period
for the year of assessment.

53
.
The  term  “aircraft  leasing  management  profits”  is  defined  in  section
14
G(1).    It means any profits of a corporation that are derived from a qualifying
aircraft  leasing  management  activity.
  In  this  context,  “aircraft  leasing
management profits” will generally be based on the accounting profits shown in
the audited income statement of the aircraft leasing manager, irrespective of the
source of the profits.

An  aircraft  leasing  manager  has  to  follow  the  arm’s  length  principle
54.
when transacting with an aircraft lessor that is an associate.    It is expected that
the aircraft leasing manager would make an arm’s length profit from qualifying
aircraft leasing management activity carried out for such an aircraft lessor.    In
exceptional circumstances, where an aircraft leasing manager incurs a substantial
loss from a qualifying aircraft leasing management activity (e.g. the qualifying
aircraft  lessor  has  become  insolvent  and  the  debt  has  become  bad),  the
Commissioner would consider excluding the loss when computing the aircraft
leasing management profits percentage for the purpose of the safe harbour rule
or exercising his discretion under section 14L.

The  term  “aircraft  leasing  management  asset”  means  an  asset  of  a
55.
corporation  used  by  it  to  carry  out  a  qualifying  aircraft  leasing  management
activity.    It  would  include  fixed  assets  such  as  business  premises  and  office
equipment used to carry out qualifying aircraft leasing management activities.
The asset values will be based on the audited statement of financial position of

27

the aircraft leasing manager, regardless of the location of the assets.    Generally,
intangibles not recorded in the statement of financial position in accordance with
generally acceptable accounting principles will not be taken into account.

56.
Section  14K(7)  provides  for  apportionment  of  the  value  of  an  asset
which is used partly for carrying out a qualifying aircraft leasing management
activity and partly for another purpose.    In computing the aggregate value of
the aircraft leasing management assets, only the part of the value of the asset that
is proportionate to the extent to which the asset is used to carry out a qualifying
aircraft leasing management activity is to be taken into account.

There may be cases whereby an aircraft leasing manager also acts as
57.
the holding company for a leasing group.    Where the equity investment in group
companies  is  substantial  or  the  dividend  income  is  not  insignificant,  the  safe
harbour rule may not be satisfied since the equity investment in group companies
and dividend do not fall within the definitions of “aircraft leasing management
asset”  and  “aircraft  leasing  management  profits”  respectively.    As  dividend
income is generally not taxable in Hong Kong, the Commissioner is prepared to
exclude  equity  investment  in  group  companies  and  dividends  from  the
denominators in the above formulas for the calculation of the ALMA and ALMP
percentages so that such an aircraft leasing manager may also be regarded as a
qualifying aircraft leasing manager under the safe harbour rule.

58.
Under  the  multiple-year  safe  harbour  rule  in  section  14K(4),  the
“consecutive” years of track record of a corporation are to be examined.    The
average ALMP and ALMA percentages must be computed based on the financial
statements  for  the  subject  year  and  the  preceding  two  years  of  assessment.
Where  the  corporation  has  carried  on  a  trade,  profession  or  business  in  Hong
Kong for less than two consecutive years of assessment immediately before the
subject year, only the corporation’s profits and assets for the subject year and the
preceding  year  of  assessment  would  be  taken  into  account  for  computing  the
average ALMP and ALMA percentages.

Example 8

Aircraft Leasing Manager-HK claimed the half rate concession under
section 14J(1) for Year 4.    It had the following track record:

28

Year

Year 1
Year 2
Year 3
Year 4

Business Activity in Hong Kong

Active Business
Dormant Business
Active Business
Active Business

Though the aircraft leasing manager had three years of active business
operations in Hong Kong, it was dormant in Year 2, leaving it with just
one  year  prior  to  the  subject  year.    Therefore,  the  aircraft  leasing
manager would be regarded as having two years of track record.    The
average ALMP and ALMA percentages would be computed based on
the audited financial statements for Years 3 and 4.

Commissioner’s determination

59.
Section  14L  allows  the  Commissioner  to  exercise  his  discretion  to
determine that a corporation is a qualifying aircraft leasing manager despite that
it fails to satisfy the conditions specified in section 14J(3) and the safe harbour
rule  under  section  14K.    Such  a  determination  would  be  made  by  the
Commissioner under section 14L(3) if he is of the opinion that the conditions
specified in section 14J(3), or the safe harbour rule, would, in the ordinary course
of business of the corporation, have been satisfied for the year of assessment.

60.
When exercising the discretion under section 14L, the Commissioner
would look into the totality of facts, in particular, the types of qualifying aircraft
leasing management activities that the aircraft leasing manager would carry out
in  the  ordinary  course  of  its  business.    The  Commissioner  may  consider  the
following factors:

(a)

the activities carried out by the corporation;

(b)

the assets and liabilities of the corporation;

(c)

the  capacities,  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  corporation’s
employees;

(d)

the functions and risks undertaken by the corporation; and

(e)

the operational history of the corporation.

SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS PRESENCE

Tax treaty benefits

Hong Kong’s tax treaty partners have been very concerned about treaty
61.
shopping.    They have expressed their views that a corporation without business
substance in Hong Kong should not be entitled to any tax treaty benefits.    The
Final Report of BEPS Action 6 (Preventing the Granting of Treaty Benefits in
Inappropriate Circumstances) has identified tax treaty abuses, and in particular
treaty shopping, as one of the most critical concerns of BEPS.    Hong Kong is
committed to implementing the  minimum standard on Action 6, which entails
the inclusion in Hong Kong’s tax treaties an express statement that the common
intention  of  the  contracting  parties  is  to  eliminate  double  taxation  without
creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion
or  avoidance  (including  through  treaty-shopping  arrangements),  and  the
implementation  of  this  common  intent  through,  among  others,  the  principal
purposes test (PPT).

62.
Though there is no restriction on the place of incorporation, qualifying
aircraft lessors and qualifying aircraft leasing managers need to ensure that they
have a substantial business presence in Hong Kong.    Any artificial arrangement
to transfer existing leasing arrangements from other jurisdictions to Hong Kong
for the purpose of obtaining unintended tax treaty benefits might not be accepted
by Hong Kong’s tax treaty partners.    It is legitimate for Hong Kong’s tax treaty
partners to rely on the PPT to deny tax treaty benefits.

Central management and control

63.
The central management and control (CMC) is located in Hong Kong
if  the  executive  officers  and  senior  management  employees  of  the  qualifying
aircraft  lessor  and  qualifying  aircraft  leasing  manager  exercise  day-to-day
responsibility  for  more  of  their  strategic,  financial  and  operational  policy
decision-making in  Hong  Kong  and  conduct  more  of  the  day-to-day  activities
necessary for preparing and making those decisions in Hong Kong, than in any
other jurisdiction.

64.

The CMC test is a well-established common law rule adopted in many
jurisdictions,  such  as  Singapore,  the  United  Kingdom  and  Australia,  in
determining the residence of a company.    The common law rule was enunciated

30

by Lord Loreburn in De Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd. v Howe, 5 TC 198 at
page 213:

“…  a  company  resides,  for  purposes  of  Income  Tax,  where  its  real
business  is  carried  on.  …  I  regard  that  as  the  true  rule;  and  the  real
business  is  carried  on  where  the  central  management  and  control
actually abides.”

 The CMC  refers  to  the  highest level of control of the business  of  a
65.
company.    Given the statutory requirements in sections 14H(4) and 14J(5), the
CMC  of  the  qualifying  aircraft  lessor  and  qualifying  aircraft  leasing  manager
must  be  exercised  in  Hong  Kong  which  is  also  the  place  where  the  main
operations  of  the  qualifying  aircraft  leasing  activities  and  qualifying  aircraft
leasing management activities are to be found.

66.
The location of CMC is wholly a question of fact.    Each case must be
decided on its own facts.    Factors that are decisive in one case may carry little
weight  in  another.    In  general,  if  the  CMC  of  a  company  is  exercised  by  the
directors in board meetings, the relevant locality is where those meetings are held.

67.
The place of board meetings may not be conclusive.    It is significant only
in so far as those meetings constitute the medium through which CMC is exercised.
In cases where CMC of a company is in fact exercised by an individual (e.g. the board
chairman  or  the  managing  director),  the  relevant  locality  is  the  place  where  the
controlling individual exercises his power.    As CMC is a question of fact and reality,
when reaching a conclusion in accordance with the case law principles, only factors
which exist for genuine commercial reasons will be considered.

Substantial activity

The Final Report of BEPS Action 5 (Countering Harmful Tax Practices
68.
More  Effectively,  Taking  into Account  Transparency  and  Substance)  contains
detailed  guidance  on  the  application  of  the  substantial  activities  criterion  to
Intellectual  Property  (IP)  regimes  as  well  as  more  general  guidance  for  the
application  of  the  substantial  activities  criterion  to  non-IP  regimes.    The
substantial activity requirement ensures that the aircraft leasing functions or the
aircraft leasing management functions are performed in Hong Kong, the assets
including the aircraft concerned are acquired or monitored in/from Hong Kong

31

and the risks associated with the aircraft leasing business or the aircraft leasing
management business are undertaken in Hong Kong.

69.
To  satisfy  the  substantial  activity  requirement,  the  core  income
generating activities which produce the qualifying profits of a qualifying aircraft
lessor or a qualifying  aircraft leasing manager need to be carried out in Hong
Kong.
  Such  activities  include:  raising  funds;  agreeing  funding  terms;
identifying and acquiring aircraft to be leased; soliciting lessees; setting the terms
and duration of leases; monitoring and revising lease agreements; managing any
risks  and  maintaining  documentation.    They  need  to  be  carried  out  by  the
qualifying aircraft lessor or the qualifying aircraft leasing manager in Hong Kong.
The word “arranged” in sections 14H(4)(a)(ii)(B) and 14J(5)(a)(ii)(B) covers the
situation  where  a  qualifying  aircraft  lessor  or  a  qualifying  aircraft  leasing
manager arranges a third party or a group entity to carry out some of the core
income generating activities in Hong Kong.

In the Harmful Tax Practices – 2017 Progress Report on Preferential
70.
Regimes (the  Report)  published in  October 2017, it is  explained that the  core
income generating activities presuppose having an adequate number of full-time
employees  with  necessary  qualifications  and  incurring  an  adequate  amount  of
operating expenditures to undertake such activities.    In an example provided in
the Report, it is said that a financing and leasing regime satisfies the requirement
for having substantial activities in the jurisdiction since the regime demonstrates
that  the  core  income  generating  activities  occur  in  the  jurisdiction  and  has  a
robust follow-up mechanism to ensure compliance.    The regime requires:

(a)

(b)

benefitting  taxpayers  to  undertake  the  leasing  activities  and
identifying  and
operations
acquiring the assets to be leased, negotiating the leasing terms,
and managing the leases;

in  the  jurisdiction,

including

benefitting  taxpayers  incur  at  least  EUR  5  million  in  annual
business spending and employ an adequate number of qualified
full-time employees to undertake the core activities (and at least
three such employees) in the jurisdiction;

(c)

benefitting  taxpayers  to  report  information  annually  on  the
income benefitting from the regime, as well as the type and level

32

of activity performed to generate the income; and

(d)

denial of benefits if the taxpayers do not meet the requirements.

71.
Commencing  for  fiscal  years  as  from  2018,  for  the  purpose  of
monitoring  substantial  activities  in  preferential  regimes,  qualifying  aircraft
lessors  and  qualifying  aircraft  leasing  managers  that  are  members  of
multinational enterprise groups with annual revenues in the preceding  year of
EUR  750  million  (equivalent  to  HK$6.8  billion)  or  more  will  be  required  to
provide  information  on  the  type  and  level  of  activities  performed  annually.
Such information includes data on whether the lessors or managers perform the
core  income  generating  activities,  the  level  of  such  activities  undertaken,  the
number of qualified full-time employees and amount of operating expenditures
associated  with the activities.    Such information is required to be reported to
Forum of Harmful Tax Practices on an annual basis.

Facts and circumstances

72.
Taking  note  that  different  corporations  may  have  different  business
models,  all  the  relevant  facts  and  circumstances  should  be  considered  when
determining whether the CMC and substantial activity requirements are satisfied.
For the year in which the aircraft leasing activity commences, it is important to
submit  for  the  Commissioner’s  consideration  a  realistic  business  plan  for
carrying out aircraft leasing activity in Hong Kong.    Since SPVs are often used
to hold an aircraft, it may be necessary to consider whether an SPV lessor has
sufficient connection or nexus with the active conduct of aircraft leasing activity
in Hong Kong, including the engagement of an aircraft leasing manager carrying
on business in Hong Kong.

Example 9

Overseas  Trading  Company-F  set  up  SPV-HK,  a  qualifying  aircraft
lessor in Hong Kong, for holding a private jet which was leased to the
company at a non-arm’s length rent.    SPV-HK did not have employees
in Hong Kong.    Nor was it managed by a qualifying aircraft leasing
manager in Hong Kong.    It had two nominee directors and used the
business  address  of  a  Hong  Kong  secretarial  firm  as  its  registered
address.

33

It seems that the above leasing arrangement might be used for shifting
overseas income to the half rate regime in Hong Kong for tax avoidance
purpose.    SPV-HK  did  not  have  business  substance  in  Hong  Kong
except  merely  owning  the  private  jet.    In  the  circumstances,  the
Commissioner would not accept that the CMC and substantial activity
requirements were satisfied.

Example 10

Overseas  Aircraft  Operator-F  set  up  SPV-HK,  a  qualifying  aircraft
lessor  in  Hong  Kong,  for  leasing  aircraft  to  it.    All  the  directors  of
SPV-HK were non-Hong Kong residents.    SPV-HK was not managed
by a Hong Kong qualifying aircraft leasing manager and did not have
employees and business premises in Hong Kong.

 Clearly,  SPV-HK  did  not  satisfy  the  CMC  and  substantial  activity
requirements and could not be entitled to the profits tax concessions
under  this  aircraft  leasing  regime.    Further,  Hong  Kong’s  tax  treaty
partner  would  have  great  reservation  regarding  the  purpose  of  such
arrangement and might invoke the PPT to deny any unintended treaty
benefits since its own tax resident was repackaged as if it was a Hong
Kong tax resident.    So there must be strong justification for such an
arrangement from the perspective of Hong Kong’s tax treaty partner.
SPV-HK must have significant business substance in Hong Kong so as
to be eligible for the profits tax concessions.

Attribution to Hong Kong

73.
Apart  from  the  CMC  and  substantial  activity  requirements,  sections
14H(4)(a)(iii) and 14J(5)(a)(iii) stipulate that the profit-generating activities of a
qualifying  aircraft  lessor  or  a  qualifying  aircraft  leasing  manager  must  not  be
carried out by a permanent establishment outside Hong Kong.    If such activities
are  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong  by  employees  of  a  non-Hong  Kong  permanent
establishment and the relevant staff costs and associated expenses are attributed
to such permanent establishment, the lessor or the manager would fail to satisfy
this attribution to Hong Kong requirement.

34

DEPRECIATION ALLOWANCE AND DISPOSAL

Denial of depreciation allowance

74.
An aircraft lessor leasing an aircraft to a Hong Kong aircraft operator
is entitled to elect for this aircraft leasing regime.    However, by virtue of section
14H(7),  it  would  not  be  granted  depreciation  allowance  under  Part  6  of  the
Ordinance in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on the provision of the
aircraft concerned for the year in which the half rate concession applies.      Such
aircraft lessor may either claim depreciation allowances or obtain the half rate
concession under this regime.

75.
In  case  a  qualifying  aircraft  lessor  leases  an  aircraft  by  way  of  an
operating  lease  to  a  Hong  Kong  aircraft  operator  which  then  sub-leases  the
aircraft to a non-Hong Kong aircraft operator due to operational reasons such as
surplus capacity, section 39E would operate to deny depreciation allowances as
such  provision  also  applies  to  sub-leases.    In  such  a  scenario,  the  qualifying
aircraft  lessor  may  consider  electing  into  this  aircraft  leasing  regime  to  take
advantage of the half rate concession.

 Example 11

Qualifying Aircraft Lessor-HK granted the right to use an aircraft to
Aircraft  Operator-HK  under  a  hire-purchase  agreement  with  a
purchase  option.    Aircraft  Operator-HK  then  leased  the  aircraft  to
Aircraft Operator-F, a non-Hong Kong aircraft operator.

Aircraft Operator-HK would be regarded as having obtained ownership
of  the  aircraft.    However,  it  would  not  be  granted  depreciation
allowances under section 39E despite that section 23C would apply to
assess  the  charter  hire  received  from  Aircraft  Operator-F.    As  for
Qualifying Aircraft Lessor-HK, the hire-purchase agreement would fall
outside  the  definition  of  “lease”  under  section  14G(1)  and  hence
Qualifying  Aircraft  Lessor-HK  is  not  entitled  to  the  profits  tax
concessions under the aircraft leasing regime.    The interest element of
the  lease  payments  received  would  be  assessed  at  full  rate.    If
Qualifying Aircraft Lessor-HK granted the right to use the aircraft to
Aircraft Operator-HK by way of an operating lease, Qualifying Aircraft

35

Lessor-HK  could  elect  into  the  aircraft  leasing  regime  to  enjoy  the
profits tax concessions.

76.
Since  no  depreciation  allowances  would  be  granted  to  a  qualifying
aircraft lessor under this aircraft leasing regime, certain provisions are thus added
to sections 37 and 39B to provide for deduction of notional annual allowances
when  calculating  depreciation  allowances  for  an  aircraft  subsequently  used  in
another trade, profession or business to produce chargeable profits.    They are
section 37(2B) to (2D) for the non-pooling system and section 39B(6A) to (6C)
for the pooling system.    Notional annual allowances would be deducted from
the actual cost of the aircraft for the period during which the aircraft was owned
and used by a corporation for carrying out a qualifying aircraft leasing activity
in respect of which the half rate concession applies as if such annual allowances
had been available to the corporation since it acquired the aircraft.

Example 12

 Qualifying Aircraft Lessor-HK acquired an aircraft at a consideration
of $300 million and used it for carrying out a qualifying aircraft leasing
activity in Year 1 and Year 2 where half rate concession was granted.
In  Year  3,  Qualifying Aircraft  Lessor-HK  ceased  the  aircraft  leasing
business  and  became  dormant.
  In  Year  4,  it  started  an  air
transportation business and used the aircraft for such purpose.

Section  39B(6B)  would  apply  since  the  aircraft  has  been  used  by
Qualifying Aircraft  Lessor-HK  for  carrying  out  a  qualifying  aircraft
leasing  activity  in  respect  of  which  the  half  rate  concession  applied
before  being  used  in  the  air  transportation  business.    Therefore,
depreciation allowances of the aircraft for Year 4 would be computed
as follows:

Acquisition cost
Less:  Notional A.A. for Year 1

Less:  Notional A.A. for Year 2

Less:  Notional A.A. for Year 3

Less:  A.A. for Year 4

36

$
300,000,000
  90,000,000
210,000,000
  63,000,000
147,000,000
  44,100,000
102,900,000
  30,870,000
  72,030,000

Disposal of aircraft

77.
Section 14H(8) provides certainty to qualifying aircraft lessors on the
tax treatment of gains or losses upon disposal of aircraft.    The disposal gain in
respect  of  an  aircraft  that  has  been  used  for  carrying  out  a  qualifying  aircraft
leasing activity for a continuous period of at least three years immediately prior
to its disposal would be treated as a capital gain not chargeable to profits tax.
However, a shorter period (say, two years) does not necessarily mean that such
an aircraft is not a capital asset.    The Commissioner would consider the totality
of facts and apply common law principles in making decisions.

ANTI-AVOIDANCE PROVISIONS

Disqualified from tax concessions

78.
Sections 14H(6)(b) and 14J(7)(b) provide that if section 14H(1) or 14J(1)
does not apply to a corporation for a year of assessment (cessation year), such
corporation  is  not  allowed  to  re-enter  the  half  rate  regime  for  the  year  of
assessment following the cessation year.    These provisions are to prevent abuse
and  protect  fiscal  revenue  as  a  corporation  may  opt  in  when  it  derives  profits
from qualifying operations in order for the concessionary half rate to apply; and
then opt out when it suffers losses in a subsequent year of assessment in order to
obtain deduction of losses at full rate.

If a qualifying aircraft lessor or a qualifying aircraft leasing manager merely
79.
incurs a tax loss from its qualifying operations, it would not be disqualified from being
entitled to the half rate concession.    Section 19D(1) of the Ordinance provides that the
amount of loss incurred by a person chargeable to profits tax for any year of assessment
shall be computed in like manner and for such basis period as the assessable profits for
that year of assessment would have been computed.    So if a qualifying entity incurs a
tax loss for a year of assessment, section 14H(1) or 14J(1) still applies and the tax loss
can only be set off against its other types of profits at half rate for the purpose of section
19CA of the Ordinance.    Sections 14H(6)(b) and 14J(7)(b) would not be invoked to
deny  profits  tax  concessions  to  the  qualifying  entity  for  the  subsequent  year  of
assessment.

37

Arm’s length principle

80.
Section 14M(1) and (2) ensures that the chargeable profits from a transaction
between a qualifying aircraft lessor and its associate in connection with a qualifying
aircraft leasing activity will be determined by reference to the amount of profits that
would have accrued had the same transaction been carried out at arm’s length terms
between parties who are not associates (i.e. arm’s length principle).    Such principle
would also apply to a qualifying aircraft leasing management activity of a qualifying
aircraft leasing manager by virtue of section 14M(3) and (4).

81.
“Associate” has the meaning given by section 14G(1). Section 14M(1) to (4)
sets out the conditions where the profits in respect of transactions in connection with a
qualifying aircraft leasing activity or a qualifying aircraft leasing management activity
between a qualifying entity and its associates may be subjected to adjustment.

Defeasance arrangement

Section  14M(5)  forestalls  defeasance  arrangements.

82.
  Under  the
aircraft  leasing  regime,  a  qualifying  aircraft  lessor  can  own  an  aircraft  via  a
funding  lease,  a  hire-purchase  agreement  or  a  conditional  sale  agreement.    A
qualifying  aircraft  lessor  who  owns  an  aircraft  through  such  ownership
arrangement  may  defease  the  funding  lease,  hire-purchase  agreement  or
conditional sale agreement to a third party.    The third party takes up the primary
obligation  under  such  ownership  arrangement  to  make  payments  to  the  head
lessor,  bailor  or  seller.    The  effect  of  a  defeased  arrangement  is  that  the
qualifying  aircraft  lessor  is  no  longer  obliged  to  make  payments  under  the
ownership arrangement.    In such a scenario, section 14M(5) would come into
operation and the qualifying aircraft lessor would be treated as if it had ceased
to own the aircraft.    Hence, no profits tax concessions will be granted to it in
respect of the leasing transaction with the aircraft operator as it is no longer a
qualifying aircraft leasing activity as defined in section 14G(6).

Anti-tax arbitrage rule

83.
Section 16(1A) is enacted so as to prevent tax arbitrage through aircraft
leasing transactions between connected persons.    If a Hong Kong aircraft operator
(i.e. the lessee) pays a sum, whether directly or through an interposed person, to its
connected  qualifying  aircraft  lessor  or  qualifying  aircraft  leasing  manager,  who  is

38

eligible to enjoy the half rate concession under the aircraft leasing regime, the relevant
sum  that  could  be  deducted  by  the  Hong  Kong  aircraft  operator  in  computing  its
assessable profits would be reduced such that the profits tax payable by the Hong
Kong aircraft operator is increased by reference to the amount of the reduction in the
profits  tax  payable  by  the  qualifying  aircraft  lessor  or  qualifying  aircraft  leasing
manager in respect of the relevant sum for the year of assessment or any subsequent
year of assessment.    The expression “by reference to the amount of the reduction in
the  profits  tax  payable”  refers  to  the  reduction  in  the  profits  tax  liability  of  the
qualifying entity due to the reduced tax rate as mentioned in section 16(1A)(c), that
is, the half rate concession.    Thus, when ascertaining the amount of deduction that
could be allowed to the connected person under section 16(1A), the 20% tax base
concession would be ignored.

Example 13

 Qualifying Aircraft Lessor-HK leased an aircraft to Aircraft Operator-HK
which  was  a  connected  person  within  the  meaning  in  section  14G(1).
The lease payment charged by Qualifying Aircraft Lessor-HK for the year
of assessment 2017/18 was $12 million.    Qualifying Aircraft Lessor-HK
had not claimed depreciation allowances in respect of the aircraft before
and  elected  for  the  half  rate  concession.    Its  operating  expenses
amounted to $7 million for that year.
The profits tax payable by Qualifying Aircraft Lessor-HK:
= ($12,000,000 – $7,000,000) × 20% × 8.25%
= $82,500

If Qualifying Aircraft  Lessor-HK had been subject to full profits tax
rate,  its  profits  tax  payable  would  have  been  $165,000.    The  tax
saving due to the reduction in tax rate was thus $82,500 ($165,000  –
$82,500).    The amount of the lease payment that could be deducted
by Aircraft Operator-HK would be calculated as follows:

$12,000,000 – ($82,500 ÷ 16.5%)
= $11,500,000

84.
Section  16(1A)  nullifies  the  tax  benefits  obtained  when  an  aircraft
operator subject to full tax rate shifts income to the half rate regime by making
payments to its connected qualifying aircraft lessor or qualifying aircraft leasing

39

manager.    Section  16(1A)  will  not  be  invoked  to  restrict  deduction  of
management fees paid by a qualifying aircraft lessor to a connected qualifying
aircraft  leasing  manager  for  qualifying  aircraft  leasing  management  services
provided as their profits are assessed at half tax rate.

Sections 61 and 61A

85.
The Commissioner will generally act in accordance with this Practice
Note  in  granting  profits  tax  concessions  to  qualifying  aircraft  lessors  and
qualifying aircraft leasing managers.    However, in cases where tax avoidance
is involved or this aircraft leasing regime is abused to secure a result which is
not intended under the 2017 Amendment (No. 3) Ordinance, the Commissioner
will consider invoking the general anti-avoidance provisions under section 61 or
61A of the Ordinance as appropriate to counteract the avoidance.

INCOME  FROM AIRCRAFT  BUSINESS  OR  MANAGING AIRCRAFT
BUSINESS

Codification of case law principles

86.
Section 15(1) of the Ordinance sets out various sums that are regarded
to  be  trading  receipts  arising  in  or  derived  from  Hong  Kong  from  a  trade,
profession  or  business  carried  on  in  Hong  Kong,  and  hence  are  chargeable  to
profits tax.    The provisions in section 15(1)(n) ensure that sums received by or
accrued to a corporation by way of gains or profits (other than those arising from
the sale of capital assets) arising through or from the carrying on in Hong Kong
by the corporation of its business of:

(a)

granting  a  right  to  use  an  aircraft  to  another  person  (aircraft
business); or

(b)  managing  a  corporation  carrying  on  an  aircraft  business  or  of

managing an aircraft business.

are chargeable to profits tax even if the aircraft concerned is used outside Hong
Kong.

40

Section 15(1)(n) makes it clear that the “operation test” applies in the
87.
determination of the source of income derived from an aircraft leasing business
or an aircraft leasing management business.    The principle of the “operation test”
laid down in CIR v Hang Seng Bank Limited, [1991] 1 AC 306 and expanded in
CIR v HK-TVB International Limited, [1992] 2 AC 397 is that “one looks to see
what the taxpayer has done to earn the profit in question and where he has done
it”.    Thus,  the  focus  should  be  the  place  where  the  core  income  generating
activities are performed by the aircraft lessor or aircraft leasing manager and not
the place where the aircraft is used by the aircraft operator.

88.
Given the CMC and substantial activity requirements, any qualifying
profits  derived  from  the  qualifying  aircraft  leasing  activities  or  the  qualifying
aircraft  leasing  management  activities  of  a  qualifying  aircraft  lessor  or  a
qualifying  aircraft  leasing  manager  should  be  sourced  from  Hong  Kong  and
chargeable  to  profits  tax.    The  application  of  the  “operation  test”  on  income
arising  from  an  aircraft  leasing  business  follows  the  current  practice  of  the
Department.    Section  15(1)(n)  merely  codifies  this  practice  and  the  legal
principle in case law.    No new taxation  principle was introduced in the 2017
Amendment  (No.  3)  Ordinance  and  no  change  has  been  made  to  the  source
principles by section 15(1)(n).

COMMENCEMENT DATE

Commencement of profits tax concessions and taxation rule

89.
Regarding  the  effective  date,  sums  received  by  or  accrued  to  a
qualifying aircraft lessor or a qualifying aircraft leasing manager before 1 April
2017 are not to be taken into account for the purpose of computing the qualifying
profits under section 14H(1) or 14J(1).    In other words, sums accrued before 1
April 2017 but received after that day would not be eligible for the profits tax
concessions.    For the provision under section 15(1)(n), it does not apply to sums
received or accrued before the commencement date of the 2017 Amendment (No.
3) Ordinance (i.e. 7 July 2017).

41

ADVANCE RULINGS

Ruling on specific transaction

90.
To secure tax certainty, a request in respect of a specific transaction or
structuring may be made to the Commissioner for a ruling on how the provisions
of  aircraft  leasing  regime  are  to  apply  to  the  applicant.    The  Commissioner
requires maximum disclosure for advance ruling applications and a fee needs to
be  paid.    Departmental  Interpretation  and  Practice  Notes  No.  31  explains  the
procedures and requirements for making advance ruling applications.    Such a
ruling,  if  required,  will  be  sent  to  the  competent  authority  of  the  relevant
jurisdiction  with  which  Hong  Kong  has  an  arrangement  for  exchange  of
information.    The  information  and  documents  required  to  be  provided  in  an
application for a ruling are set out in Appendix 3.

CERTIFICATE OF RESIDENT STATUS

Issuance of certificate of resident status

91.
Since withholding tax is normally imposed on aircraft rentals, a Hong
Kong  aircraft  lessor  may  be  required  to  provide  a  Hong  Kong  certificate  of
resident status to the lessee upon delivery of an aircraft so that treaty relief may
be  claimed  in  the  jurisdiction  in  which  the  lessee  resides.    This  may  be  a
condition precedent to be satisfied by a lessor prior to the commencement of a
lease if the lessee bears the obligation to pay the withholding tax.    Qualifying
aircraft lessors satisfying the CMC and substantial activity requirements should
be  able  to  obtain  a  certificate  of  resident  status  from  the  Department.    The
application  form  (IR1313A  or  IR1313B)  can  be  furnished  to  the  Department
together  with  supporting  documents  such  as  a  copy  of  the  management
agreement entered into with a Hong Kong qualifying aircraft leasing manager.
If an aircraft lessor is newly established in Hong Kong, submission of a five-year
business plan and details of its liability to pay  Hong Kong profits tax may be
provided  to  the  Department  for  determining  whether  it  is  a  Hong  Kong  tax
resident.

As  a  rule,  tax  credit  would  not  be  allowed  to  the  qualifying  aircraft

lessor if the withholding tax on aircraft rentals is borne by the lessee.

Appendix  1

Trust Arrangement

In  a  trust  involving  a  leased  aircraft,  the  trustee  holds  either  the
1.
ownership interest and/or the leasehold interest in the aircraft (which is subject
to a lease) in trust for the beneficiary.

2.

An example of leasing model involving bare trust is appended below.

Hong Kong Aircraft
Lessor
(Beneficiary)

[Beneficial Ownership]

(Lessee)

The  bare  trustee  and  the  beneficiary  enter  into  a  trust  instrument,

3.
pursuant to which, among others:

(a)

the beneficiary appoints the bare trustee to hold all right, title
and  interest  in  and  to  the  aircraft  (whether  or  not  through  a
funding  lease,  hire-purchase  agreement  or  conditional  sale
agreement),  the  operating  lease  and  any  other  documents  in
connection therewith in trust for the beneficiary;

(b)  other  than  the  bare  legal  ownership,  the  bare  trustee  has  no
beneficial,  equitable  or  other  interest  in  the  aircraft  (or  the
funding  lease,  hire-purchase  agreement  or  conditional  sale
agreement),  the  operating  lease  or  any  other  documents  in
connection therewith.

4.

In a typical trust structure:

(a)

(b)

(c)

The  bare  trustee  is  a  person  established  in  or  outside  Hong
Kong.

The bare trust is a fiscally transparent entity.    All amounts of
rent, security deposits, proceeds of sale and other amounts in
respect  of  the  operating  lease  or  the  aircraft  received  by  the
bare trustee will be distributed promptly to the beneficiary.

The  bare  trustee  has  no  power  or  authority  to  deal  with  the
aircraft  (or  the  funding  lease,  hire-purchase  agreement  or
conditional  sale agreement), the operating lease or any other
documents  in  connection  therewith  except  as  provided  in
instructions or authorisation from the beneficiary.

(d)  Other  than  the  bare  legal  ownership,  the  bare  trustee  has  no
beneficial,  equitable  or  other  interest  in  the  aircraft  (or  the
funding  lease,  hire-purchase  agreement  or  conditional  sale
agreement),  the  operating  lease  or  any  other  documents  in
connection therewith.

(e)

It  is  the  beneficiary  who  is  carrying  on  qualifying  aircraft
leasing activities in Hong Kong.

5.
  While the bare trustee holds the bare legal ownership, the beneficiary,
who  carries  on  the  qualifying  aircraft  leasing  activities  in  Hong  Kong,  is
regarded  as  the  owner  of  the  aircraft  for  the  purposes  of  the  aircraft  leasing
regime.    Provided that other relevant conditions are satisfied, the beneficiary
will be entitled to the tax concession.

Aircraft Transaction Structuring

Appendix 2

A.

Japanese conditional sale structure

While the legal title to an aircraft for leasing to a Japanese aircraft
1.
operator has to be held by a Japanese titleholder, an aircraft lessor resident in
Hong Kong may be regarded as owning the Japanese-registered aircraft under
a conditional sale agreement:

Japanese Titleholder

(1) Sale

(2) Conditional Sale

Hong Kong Aircraft Lessor

(3) Operating Lease

Japanese Aircraft Operator

2.

In a typical conditional sale structure:

(a)

The aircraft is sold by an aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong
to a Japanese titleholder.    By a conditional sale agreement, the
aircraft is sold  by  the Japanese  titleholder back to the aircraft
lessor resident in Hong Kong.    The aircraft lessor resident in
Hong  Kong  is  not  expected  to  make  a  substantial  profit  in
relation to the sale and buy-back of the aircraft.

(b)

The legal title of the aircraft is kept by the Japanese titleholder
while the risks and rewards arising from the ownership of the
aircraft are transferred to the aircraft lessor resident in Hong
Kong.

iii

(c)

(d)

The  aircraft  is  leased  by  the  aircraft  lessor  resident  in  Hong
Kong to a Japanese aircraft operator under an operating lease.

The  legal  title  of  the  aircraft  will  pass  to  the  aircraft  lessor
in  Hong  Kong  upon  payment  of  a  nominal
resident
consideration  to  the  Japanese  titleholder  at  the  end  of  the
operating lease with the Japanese aircraft operator.

3.
While the Japanese titleholder holds the legal title of the aircraft, the
aircraft  lessor  resident  in  Hong  Kong  is  regarded  as  having  satisfied  the
ownership requirement since it has acquired the aircraft under a conditional sale
agreement.    The leasing of the aircraft by the aircraft lessor resident in Hong
Kong  to  the  Japanese  aircraft  operator  is  thus  a  qualifying  aircraft  leasing
activity.    If the property in the aircraft is reasonably expected not to pass to
the aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong under the conditional sale agreement,
the aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong will not be treated as the owner of the
aircraft  by  virtue  of  the  provision  in  section  14G(5)  and  the  leasing  of  the
aircraft to the Japanese aircraft operator will not be a qualifying aircraft leasing
activity eligible for the profits tax concessions.

B.  Russian lease-in-lease-out structure

1.
Since  Bermuda  has  concluded  an  agreement  with  Russia  on
maintenance  of  continuing  airworthiness  of  aircraft  and  transfer  of  certain
regulatory oversight functions and duties under the Convention on International
Civil Aviation 1944, an aircraft operated by a Russian aircraft operator may be
registered in Bermuda under a lease-in-lease-out structure:

Bermuda SPV

(1) Lease

(2) Leaseback

Hong Kong Aircraft Lessor

(3) Operating Lease

Russian Aircraft Operator

iv

2.

In a typical lease-in-lease-out structure:

(a)

(b)

The  aircraft  is  leased  by  an  aircraft  lessor  resident  in  Hong
Kong to an SPV established in Bermuda.    It is then registered
in Bermuda.    The aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong and
the  SPV  established  in  Bermuda  may  be  part  of  a  group  of
companies.    The legal title and ownership of the aircraft are
retained by the aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong.

The  aircraft  is  leased  by  the  SPV  in  Bermuda  back  to  the
aircraft  lessor  resident  in  Hong  Kong  at  a  nominal  sum  to
substantiate  such  lease  and/or  cover  its  operating  expenses.
The  SPV  in  Bermuda  is  in  substance  a  pass-through  entity
purely for aircraft registration purposes and is not expected to
retain a substantial profit.

(c)

The  aircraft  is  leased  by  the  aircraft  lessor  resident  in  Hong
Kong to a Russian aircraft operator under an operating lease.

The leasing of the aircraft by the aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong
3.
to the Russian aircraft operator is a qualifying aircraft leasing activity since the
ownership of the aircraft is retained by the aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong.

ECA/US EXIM guaranteed or supported financing

ECA/US EXIM guaranteed or supported financing is used by aircraft
1.
lessors to lower their financing costs for acquisition of aircraft.    “ECA” refers
to Bpifrance Assurance Export of France, Euler Hermes Kreditversicherungs
Aktiengesellschaft of Germany (Euler Hermes) and UK Export Finance of the
United  Kingdom  (UKEF)  for  Airbus  aircraft.    “US  EXIM”  refers  to  the
Export-Import Bank of the United States for Boeing aircraft.    In an ECA/US
EXIM guaranteed or supported financing structure, the ownership of an aircraft
is often required to be vested in a bankruptcy-remote SPV under an orphan trust.
Where a lessor borrows a loan to finance the purchase of an aircraft, the lender
may require the aircraft to be held by a bankruptcy-remote SPV so as to provide
greater security to the lender in case of default by the lessor.

structure:

(a)

The SPV titleholder,  which is unrelated to  the aircraft lessor

jurisdiction like the Cayman Islands and the State of Delaware
in the United States.

vi

(b)

(c)

(d)

The lenders advance a loan to the SPV titleholder as borrower.
The  repayment  obligations  of  the  SPV  titleholder  are
guaranteed  or  supported,  subject  to  certain  conditions,  by
ECA/US EXIM.

The SPV titleholder has legal title of the aircraft and it gives
an aircraft mortgage to the lenders as security.

The  aircraft  is  leased  by  the  SPV  titleholder  to  the  aircraft
lessor resident in Hong Kong under a hire-purchase agreement
or a finance lease.    On the exercise of an option, the aircraft
is purchased by the aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong at a
nominal  consideration  at  the  end  of  the  lease  term  or  in  the
event of an early  termination.    The legal title to  the aircraft
can  also  be  automatically  transferred  to  the  aircraft  lessor
resident in Hong Kong at the end of the lease term or in the
event of an early termination.

(e)

The  aircraft  lessor  resident  in  Hong  Kong  then  leases  the
aircraft to an aircraft operator under an operating lease.

The aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong holds the aircraft as a bailee
3.
under a hire-purchase agreement or as a lessee under a funding lease.    As such,
the leasing of the aircraft by the aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong to the
aircraft operator is a qualifying aircraft leasing activity.

French or Japanese tax lease financing

French  tax  lease  and  Japanese  tax  lease  are  used  in  the  big  ticket

leasing market, including aircraft, as a means to lower the cost of financing of
lessors or airlines.

In a French or Japanese tax lease financing structure, the aircraft is

acquisition of the aircraft.

In a typical French or Japanese tax lease financing structure:

(a)

(b)

The aircraft is sold by the aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong
to an unrelated SPV set up in  France or Japan by  the equity
provider.

The lender advances a loan and the equity provider makes an
equity contribution to the SPV in France or Japan so that it can
acquire legal title and/or ownership of the aircraft.

viii

(c)

The  aircraft  is  leased  by  the  SPV  in  France  or  Japan  to  the
aircraft  lessor  resident  in  Hong  Kong  under  a  hire-purchase
agreement or a funding lease.    Tax deferral benefits from the
arrangement  shared  by  the  aircraft  lessor  resident  in  Hong
Kong will reduce the financing costs incurred by the aircraft
lessor resident in Hong Kong for acquisition of the aircraft.

(d)

The aircraft is sub-leased by the aircraft lessor resident in Hong
Kong to an aircraft operator.

By  virtue  of  the  definition  of  “own”  under  section  14G(1),  the
4.
ownership  requirement  will  be  regarded  as  having  been  satisfied  since  the
aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong holds the aircraft as a bailee under a hire-
purchase  agreement  or  as  a  lessee  under  a  funding  lease. The  leasing  of  the
aircraft by the aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong to the aircraft operator is a
qualifying aircraft leasing activity.

E.

Securitisation

Securitisation  may  be  used  by  an  aircraft  lessor  resident  in  Hong
1.
Kong to raise funds from the capital market in Hong Kong for acquisition of
aircraft.    The  securitisation  structure  used  by  the  aircraft  lessor  resident  in
Hong Kong may involve a sale and leaseback arrangement.

In a typical securitisation structure:

(c)

(d)

The aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong owns a portfolio of
aircraft which are leased to aircraft operators.

The  aircraft  are  sold  by  the  aircraft  lessor  resident  in  Hong
Kong to an SPV, which is set up as a securitisation vehicle, in
a  jurisdiction  appropriate  for  raising  funds  from  the  capital
market in Hong Kong.

The aircraft are leased back from the SPV to the aircraft lessor
resident in Hong Kong.

The  operating  leases  between  the  aircraft  lessor  resident  in
Hong Kong and the aircraft operators remain unchanged.

x

3.
If a purchase option is given to the aircraft lessor resident in Hong
Kong to acquire the aircraft at a nominal price or at a price below the fair market
value, the lease will be in substance a hire-purchase agreement.    The lease can
also be structured as a funding lease such that the property in the aircraft would
be transferred to the aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong at the end of the lease
term.    In the circumstances, the aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong will hold
the aircraft as a bailee under a hire-purchase agreement or as a lessee under a
  It  will  be  regarded  as  having  satisfied  the  ownership

requirement by virtue of the definition of “own” under section 14G(1).

The SPV and the aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong may enter into
4.
a  lease  arrangement  prescribed  in  section  6(1)  of  Schedule  17A  as  part  of  a
specified alternative bond scheme.    If the conditions under section 13(1) and
(2) of Schedule 17A are met, the bond arrangement (between the SPV and the
bond holders) and the lease arrangement (between the aircraft lessor resident in
Hong Kong and the SPV) will be treated as debt arrangements under sections
21 and 22 of Schedule 17A.    The acquisition, leasing and disposal transactions
involving the aircraft between the SPV and the aircraft lessor resident in Hong
Kong  will  be  disregarded.    In  such  a  lease  arrangement,  the  aircraft  lessor
resident  in  Hong  Kong  will  continue  to  be  treated  as  having  retained  the
ownership of the aircraft.

5.
If the SPV is not to dispose of the aircraft back to the aircraft lessor
resident in Hong Kong by the end of the specified term of the securitisation
arrangement, the investment arrangement will not be a lease arrangement under
section 6(1) of Schedule 17A and thus not a specified investment arrangement
under  section  5  of  Schedule  17A.    Section  22  of  Schedule  17A  will  be
inapplicable.    The aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong will not be regarded
as owning the aircraft under section 14G(1) and the leasing of the aircraft by
the aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong to aircraft operators would not be a
qualifying aircraft leasing activity eligible for the profits tax concessions.

F.

Leasing and management activities in a single corporate entity

If an aircraft leasing company does not use special purpose vehicles
1.
to hold aircraft for leasing, it may adopt a centralised model.    Both qualifying
aircraft leasing activity and qualifying aircraft leasing management activity are
carried out in Hong Kong by a single corporate entity.

2.

In a typical centralised leasing model:

(a)

(b)

(c)

The leasing company resident in Hong Kong carries out both
aircraft  leasing  activity  and  aircraft  leasing  management
activity.

It is the owner of a number of aircraft and leases the aircraft to
aircraft operators in various jurisdictions by way of operating
leases.

It  also  provides  aircraft  leasing  management  services  to
qualifying  aircraft  lessors  in  Hong  Kong  and  non-qualifying
aircraft  lessors  outside  Hong  Kong.    In  return,  it  receives
management fees.

xii

3.
Since the leasing company resident in Hong Kong is the owner of the
aircraft, the leasing of such aircraft to aircraft operators is a qualifying aircraft
leasing activity.    Despite engaging in an aircraft leasing management activity,
the leasing company resident in Hong Kong will be regarded as a qualifying
aircraft lessor since the aircraft leasing management activity is an integral part
of the aircraft leasing business.    Thus, it should be eligible for the profits tax
concessions in respect of the rental income derived from leasing of aircraft to
aircraft operators.

4.
Regarding the aircraft leasing management activity, provided that the
leasing company resident in Hong Kong satisfies the safe harbour rule under
section 14K with respect to such activity (i.e. the aircraft leasing management
services rendered to non-qualifying aircraft lessors outside Hong Kong are no
more  than  25%  of  its  aircraft  leasing  management  activity  in  terms  of  both
profits and assets), it can be regarded as a qualifying aircraft leasing manager.
The management fees derived from the qualifying aircraft leasing management
activity  are  eligible  for  the  profits  tax  concessions.    When  computing  the
ALMP  and ALMA  percentages,  profits  and  assets  relating  to  the  qualifying
aircraft leasing activity may be excluded.

Leasing via an intermediate lessor in a free trade zone or a special
economic zone

1.
Aircraft operators of other jurisdictions may request the aircraft lessor
resident in Hong Kong to lease an aircraft to them via an intermediate lessor
established in a free trade zone or a special economic zone for the purpose of
obtaining  value  added  tax  (VAT)  refunds  or  other  preferential  tax  benefits
offered therein.

(2) Operating Lease

Aircraft Operator
in Jurisdiction F

In a typical leasing structure involving an intermediate lessor in the

2.
home jurisdiction of the aircraft operator:

(a)

The aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong is the owner of the
aircraft.    It leases the aircraft to an intermediate lessor set up
in a free trade zone or a special economic zone in the aircraft
operator’s  home  jurisdiction  by  way  of  an  operating  lease.
The  intermediate  lessor  may  be  associated  with  the  aircraft
lessor  resident  in  Hong  Kong,  the  aircraft  operator  or  an
unrelated party.

xiv

(b)

The  intermediate  lessor  then  sub-leases  the  aircraft  to  the
aircraft  operator  by  way  of  an  operating  lease.    If  the
intermediate  lessor  is  associated  with  the  aircraft  lessor
resident  in  Hong  Kong  and  all  the  substantial  activities  are
carried out in Hong Kong, the intermediate lessor should only
make a nominal profit to cover its administrative expenses.

(c)

The VAT refund or other tax benefits obtained in the free trade
zone  or  special  economic  zone  may  then  be  shared  with  the
aircraft operator, lowering its cost of leasing aircraft.

3.
Strictly, the leasing of aircraft by the aircraft lessor resident in Hong
Kong to the intermediate lessor does not fall within the definition of “aircraft
leasing  activity”  under  section  1(1)  of  Schedule  17F.    If  the  arrangement  is
justified by commercial reasons (e.g. soliciting incentives provided to aircraft
leasing business by a free trade zone or special economic zone of a jurisdiction),
  If  the
the  interposition  of  an  intermediate  lessor  may  be  accepted.
intermediate lessor acts as the dependent agent of the aircraft lessor resident in
Hong Kong, the intermediate lessor may trigger a permanent establishment in
the free trade zone or special economic zone.

The aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong is expected to receive an
4.
arm’s length rent from the intermediate lessor.    The leasing of aircraft to the
aircraft  operator  indirectly  via  an  intermediate  lessor  can  be  regarded  as  a
qualifying  aircraft  leasing  activity  and  thus  eligible  for  the  profits  tax
concessions.

Structures  involving  an  intermediate  lessor  located  in  an  overseas
5.
jurisdiction can be subject to scrutiny since it may be found to have been set up
for the main purpose of obtaining tax benefits.    The intermediate lessor may
also be expected by the overseas jurisdiction to meet an activity threshold (i.e.
the substantial activity requirement) and to receive an income commensurate
with the value of the activities it performs.    Such a structure may not satisfy
the attribution to Hong Kong requirement.

xv

H.  Leasing via an intermediate lessor in a third jurisdiction

Under certain structures, if an aircraft is leased to an aircraft operator
1.
in a second jurisdiction via an intermediate lessor set up in a third jurisdiction,
the  withholding  tax  on  lease  rentals  payable  by  the  aircraft  operator  in  the
second jurisdiction may be reduced under the tax treaty between the second and
the third jurisdictions.

In  a  typical  leasing  structure  involving  an  intermediate  lessor  in  a

2.
third jurisdiction:

(a)

The aircraft lessor resident in Hong Kong is the owner of the
aircraft.    It leases the aircraft to an intermediate lessor set up
in  Jurisdiction  F1  by  way  of  an  operating  lease.    The
intermediate lessor may be associated with the aircraft lessor
resident in Hong Kong or the aircraft operator in Jurisdiction
F2.

(b)

The intermediate lessor in Jurisdiction F1 then sub-leases the
aircraft to the aircraft operator in Jurisdiction F2 by way of an
operating lease.

xvi

3.
Strictly, the leasing of aircraft by the aircraft lessor resident in Hong
Kong to the intermediate lessor does not fall within the definition of “aircraft
leasing activity” under section 1(1) of Schedule 17F.    If the intermediate lessor
in Jurisdiction F1 is owned by the lessor resident in Hong Kong or its associate
and there are commercial reasons for the lease to be structured this way, the
aircraft lessor resident  in Hong Kong should  not be regarded as engaging in
treaty  shopping  or  tax  avoidance.    However,  there  is  a  potential  risk  of
removal of access to treaty benefits for non-owner lessors and low substance
owner lessors.

4.
The  substance  of  the  aircraft  lessor  resident  in  Hong  Kong  and  its
functional  capability  to  acquire,  manage  and  exploit  aircraft  assets  more
profitably  than  the  intermediate  lessor  should  make  it  unlikely  that  the
transactions or the involvement of the intermediate lessor is designed to secure
a tax reduction in Hong Kong.    Even if that is not clear, the presence of those
factors  would  point  away  from  a  conclusion  that  the  transactions  would  not
have taken place at all in the absence of the tax concessions.    Thus, the aircraft
lessor resident in Hong Kong should be eligible for the profits tax concessions.

5.
If  the  decision  to  lease  the  aircraft  to  the  aircraft  operator  via  its
wholly owned intermediate lessor is made at the request of the aircraft operator,
the  interposition  of  an  intermediate  lessor  may  be  justified  by  commercial
reasons.    Where all the leasing activities are performed by the aircraft lessor
resident in Hong Kong, the intermediate lessor is expected to earn a nominal
profit to cover its administrative expenses.    In such circumstances, the leasing
of aircraft to the aircraft operator indirectly via an intermediate lessor can be
regarded  as  a  qualifying  aircraft  leasing  activity  eligible  for  the  profits  tax
concessions.
