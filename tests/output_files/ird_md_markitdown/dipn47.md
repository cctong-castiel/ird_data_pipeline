INTRODUCTION

Global  Forum  on  Transparency  and  Exchange  of  Information  for  Tax
Purposes

The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for
Tax  Purposes1  (Global  Forum)  is  the  multilateral  framework  within  which
work on transparency and exchange of information (EOI) for tax purposes has
been  carried  out  by  both  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and
Development  (OECD)  and  non-OECD  economies  since  2000.    Since  its
restructuring in 2009, the Global Forum has become the key international body
working  on  the  implementation  of  the  international  standards  on  tax
transparency.    The  Global  Forum  ensures  that  these  high  standards  of
transparency and EOI for tax purposes are in place around the world through its
monitoring and peer review activities.

2.
purposes:

There  are  two  internationally  agreed  standards  on  EOI  for  tax

(a)       EOI on request; and

(b)       automatic exchange of information.

3.
This  Departmental  Interpretation  and  Practice  Note  sets  out  the
practice  of  the  Department  on  EOI  on  request.    It  explains  the  safeguards
available and the procedural guidelines to be followed by officers of the Inland
Revenue Department.

EOI on Request Standards

The international  standard of EOI is primarily  reflected in the 2002
4.
OECD Model Agreement on Exchange of Information on Tax Matters and its
commentary,  Article  26  of  the  OECD  Model  Tax  Convention  on  Income  and
on Capital (OECD Model Tax Convention) and its commentary and Article 26
of the United Nations Model Double Taxation Convention between Developed
and Developing Countries and its commentary.

1  As  at  February  2020,  the  Global  Forum  has  161  members  participating  on  an  equal  footing,
together  with  19  observers.    All  member  jurisdictions  have  committed  to  implementing  the
international standard on EOI.

The  EOI  standard  provides  for  exchange  on  request  of  information
5.
foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of the applicable instrument
or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic tax laws of a requesting
jurisdiction.    Fishing  expeditions  are  not  authorised  but  all  foreseeably
relevant  information  must  be  provided,  including  ownership,  accounting  and
banking information.    The EOI standard currently also requires:

(a)

no  restrictions  on  exchange  caused  by  bank  secrecy  or
domestic tax interest requirements;

(b)

availability of reliable information and powers to obtain it;

(c)

respect for taxpayers’ rights; and

(d)

strict confidentiality of information exchanged.

Hong Kong always seeks to abide by the EOI standard.    Taxpayers’
6.
rights  are  fully  respected  and  the  confidentiality  of  information  exchanged  is
protected.

7.
All  Global  Forum  members,  as  well  as  non-members  that  are
relevant  to  the  Global  Forum’s  work,  are  assessed  through  a  peer  review
process2  for  their  implementation  of  the  EOI  standard  as  set  out  in  the  2016
Terms of Reference, which break down the standard into 10 essential elements
under three categories:

(a)       availability of ownership, accounting and banking information;

(b)       access to information by the competent authority; and

(c)       exchanging information.

2  Since 2010, the Global Forum has been undertaking a robust, transparent and accelerated process
of  reviews  of  the  implementation  of  the  EOI  standard.    Assessment  teams  conduct  systematic
examinations and assessments of jurisdictions’ legal and regulatory frameworks for EOI and also of
the jurisdictions’ practical application of their frameworks.    The ultimate goal of the peer review
process is to help jurisdictions to effectively implement the international EOI standard.

 2

EOI Instruments

Hong Kong has  made  use of double taxation agreement (DTA), tax
8.
information  exchange  agreement  (TIEA) 3  and  the  Convention  on  Mutual
Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (the Convention)4  as instruments for
EOI  with  other  jurisdictions.    In  this  practice  note,  DTAs,  TIEAs  and  the
Convention are referred to collectively as the “EOI Instruments”.

While  the  Convention  enables  Hong  Kong  to  gain  access  to  a  wide
9.
network  of  jurisdictions  for  exchanging  information  as  required  under  the
automatic  exchange  of  financial  account  information  in  tax  matters  and  the
base erosion and profit shifting initiatives, it remains a policy priority to seek to
conclude  DTAs  with  Hong  Kong’s  trading  and  investment  partners  given  the
benefits of DTAs.    Hong Kong will continue its efforts in persuading trading
and investment partners to commence DTA negotiations with Hong Kong.

Competent authority

10.
All EOIs are conducted by the competent authorities of Hong Kong
and the EOI partners.    In the EOI Instruments, the term “competent authority”
is defined, in the case of Hong Kong, as “the Commissioner of Inland Revenue
or  his  authorised  representative”.    In  this  connection,  the  Commissioner  has
authorised the two Deputy Commissioners as authorised representatives.

Safeguards

11.
In  order  to  protect  taxpayers’  privacy  and  confidentiality  of  any
information exchanged, highly prudent safeguard measures have been adopted
and followed in Hong Kong:

(a)       information  sought  should  be  foreseeably  relevant  (i.e.  there

will be no fishing expeditions);

3  A TIEA is a standalone agreement providing for EOI.    It does not provide any double taxation

relief or tax benefit.

4    The Convention is a multilateral instrument jointly developed by the OECD and the Council of
Europe to provide for all possible form of administrative cooperation between state parties in the
assessment  and  collection  of  taxes,  in  particular  with  a  view  to  combating  tax  avoidance  and
evasion.    It  provides  a  basis  for  jurisdictions  to  conduct  automatic  exchange  of  financial
account  information  in  tax  matters  and  implement  the  initiatives  to  combat  base  erosion  and
profit shifting on a multilateral basis.

 3

(b)       scope  of  tax  types  is  confined  to  the  taxes  covered  by  the

relevant EOI Instrument;

(c)       information  received  from  the  EOI  partner  should  be  treated

as confidential;

(d)       information  will  only  be  disclosed  to  the  tax  authorities

concerned and their oversight bodies;

(e)       information  requested  should  not  be  disclosed  to  a  third

jurisdiction;

(f)       information will not be provided under certain circumstances
(e.g.  the  supply  of  information  would  disclose  any  trade,
business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade
process,  the  information  is  covered  by  legal  professional
privilege).

Secrecy provisions

12.
Section  4  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  (IRO)  provides  that
except in the performance of duties under the IRO, a person appointed under or
employed  in  carrying  out  the  provisions  of  the  IRO  shall  preserve  and  aid  in
preserving  secrecy  with  regard  to  all  matters  relating  to  the  affairs  of  any
person  coming  to  his  knowledge.    Section  49(5)  of  the  IRO  provides  that
where any arrangements have effect by virtue of that section, the obligation as
to  secrecy  imposed  by  section  4  shall  not  prevent  the  disclosure  to  any
authorised officer of the government with which the arrangements are made of
such  information  as  is  required  to  be  disclosed  under  the  arrangements.
Therefore,  disclosure  of  information  to  EOI  partners  under  and  in  accordance
with the relevant instrument does not contravene the secrecy provisions under
the IRO.

THE RELEVANT LEGISLATIONS

The Inland Revenue (Amendment) Ordinance 2010

13.
On  12  March  2010,  the  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  Ordinance
2010 (the 2010 Amendment Ordinance) became effective.    The purpose of the
2010  Amendment  Ordinance  was  to  enable  the  Commissioner  to  collect  and
disclose information in response to requests made by the EOI partners for their
own  tax  purposes.    The  provisions  in  the  2010  Amendment  Ordinance  are
summarised as follows:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

Section  49(1A)  of  the  IRO  clarifies  that  if  an  arrangement
made with a territory outside Hong Kong allows EOI, it shall
have effect in relation to tax of that territory.

Section 51(4AA) of the IRO enables the Assessor to exercise
the  same  power  under  section  51(4)  of  the  IRO  to  collect
information concerning tax of a territory  outside Hong  Kong
for the purpose of EOI.

Section 51B(1AA) of the IRO enables a magistrate to exercise
the same power under section 51B of the IRO to issue search
warrants for information concerning tax of a territory outside
Hong Kong for the purpose of EOI.

Section 80(2D) of the IRO provides that a person commits an
offence  if  the  person,  without  reasonable  excuse,  gives  any
incorrect information in relation to any matter that affects the
person’s  or  another  person’s  liability  to  tax  of  a  territory
outside Hong Kong for the purpose of EOI.

(e)

The  word  “tax”  in  section  58(1)(c)  of  the  Personal  Data
(Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) includes any tax of a territory
outside Hong Kong for the purpose of EOI.

The Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2013

14.

On  19  July  2013,  the  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  (No.  2)

 5

Ordinance 2013 (the 2013 Amendment Ordinance) took effect.    It was enacted
to  provide  a  legal  framework  for  standalone  TIEAs  and  to  enhance  the  EOI
arrangements  in  respect  of  tax  types  and  limitation  on  disclosure.    The
provisions in the 2013 Amendment Ordinance are summarised as follows:

(a)

(b)

(c)

Section 49(1B) of the IRO enables arrangements made with a
territory outside Hong Kong not only for affording relief from
double  taxation,  but  also  for  exchanging  information  in
relation to any tax imposed by the laws of Hong Kong or the
territory concerned.

Sections  51  and  52  of  the  IRO  clarify  that  the  power  of  the
Commissioner to obtain information is exercisable not only in
respect  of  information  possessed  by  a  person,  but  also  in
respect of information in a person’s control.

Section  4  of  the  Inland  Revenue  (Disclosure  of  Information)
Rules  (Cap.  112  sub.  leg.  BI)  (the  Disclosure  Rules)  enables
the  Commissioner  to  disclose  information  that  relates  to  the
carrying out of the provisions of the relevant arrangements, or
to the administration or enforcement of the tax law of the EOI
partner,  in  respect  of  any  period  that  starts  after  the  relevant
arrangements have come into operation.

The Inland Revenue (Amendment) Ordinance 2018

15.
On  2  February  2018,  the  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  Ordinance
2018 took effect.    It was enacted to provide a legal framework for Hong Kong
to  implement  multilateral  tax  arrangements  under  the  IRO.    It  empowers  the
Chief Executive in Council (CE-in-Council) to make an order to give effect in
respect of arrangements that have been made with more than one government
or  arrangements  that  have  been  made  by  the  Central  People’s  Government
(CPG) and applied to Hong Kong.

The  Inland  Revenue  (Convention  on  Mutual  Administrative  Assistance  in
Tax Matters) Order

16.

The Convention has been open for signature by states only and each

 6

signatory state may specify the territory or territories to which the Convention
applies.    Upon the request of Hong Kong, the CPG agreed in principle in May
2017  to  extend  the  application  of  the  Convention  to  Hong  Kong.    The
declaration5  for  extending  the  application  of  the  Convention  to  Hong  Kong
(Declaration for Extension) made by the CPG was registered at the OECD on
29 May 2018.

17.
After  CPG’s  deposit  of  the  Declaration  for  Extension  and  Hong
Kong’s list of reservations and declarations, the CE-in-Council made an order
under section 49(1A) of the IRO to give effect to the Convention in Hong Kong.
The Inland Revenue (Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax
Matters) Order was published in Gazette on 13 July 2018 and the Convention
entered into force in Hong Kong on 1 September 2018.

Inland Revenue (Disclosure of Information) Rules

The Disclosure Rules came into operation on 12 March 2010.    They
18.
were  made  under  section  49(6)  of  the  IRO  and  they  can  be  applied  to  the
provisions of any international arrangements having effect under section 49 of
the IRO.    They provide a set of fair procedures to protect confidentiality and
privacy right.

TAX INFORMATION

Reasons for exchange

In the course of an examination or audit, a tax official of a territory
19.
outside  Hong  Kong  may  need  information  which  has  not  been  provided  by  a
person or the person’s agent and which does not appear to be available within
the territory.    The information however may be available in Hong Kong.

20.
This information may help to ensure that the terms of the DTA with
Hong  Kong  are  correctly  applied.    For  example,  credit  can  be  given  for  tax
paid in Hong Kong against tax due in this territory on the same income.    This
may  be  where  a  withholding  tax  has  correctly  been  levied  in  Hong  Kong  on

the Convention.

certain royalty income.    Information can also be used to make tax assessments
and to detect and counter cases of avoidance and evasion.

No domestic tax interest requirement

Hong Kong has an obligation to exchange information in accordance
21.
with  the  provisions  of  an  EOI  Instrument.    Such  information  shall  be
exchanged without regard to whether Hong Kong needs the information for tax
purposes  under  the  IRO  or  whether  the  conduct  being  investigated  would
constitute  a  crime  under  the  laws  of  Hong  Kong  if  such  conduct  occurred  in
Hong  Kong.    The  provisions  of  an  EOI  Instrument  provide  that  a  requested
jurisdiction  cannot  decline  to  supply  information  solely  because  it  has  no
domestic tax interest in such information.    After removal of the domestic tax
interest  requirement  under  the  2010  Amendment  Ordinance,  Hong  Kong  is
required  to  gather  and  provide  the  information  requested  even  if  Hong  Kong
has no domestic tax interest regarding the information.

Foreseeably relevant

Information  which  is  requested  from  an  EOI  partner  must  be
22.
“foreseeably  relevant”  to  the  tax  affairs  being  examined.
  The  term
“foreseeably  relevant”,  currently  used  in  Article  26  of  the  OECD  Model  Tax
Convention,  Article  1  of  the  OECD  Model  Agreement  on  Exchange  of
Information  on  Tax  Matters  and  Article  4  of  the  Convention  is  intended  to
provide  for  information  to  be  exchanged  to  the  widest  possible  extent,  but
excludes  “fishing  expeditions”  (i.e.  speculative  requests  for  information  that
have no apparent nexus to an open inquiry or investigation) or requests that are
unlikely  to  be  relevant  to  the  tax  affairs  of  a  given  taxpayer.    It  covers
information  in  respect  of  all  persons  (e.g.  not  limited  to  persons  that  are
residents  in  either  contracting  party  of  a  DTA),  in  both  civil  tax  matters  and
criminal  tax  matters,  such  as  tax  fraud  and  evasion.    In  AXY  and  others  v
Comptroller of Income Tax (2018) 20 ITLR 723, it was held at the Singapore
Court  of  Appeal  that  the  Comptroller’s  assessment  of  foreseeable  relevance
should be based on the face of the statements and information provided by the
foreign  tax  authority.    The  Comptroller  is  not  obliged  to  embark  on  an
independent investigation or a mini-trial to establish the veracity of the foreign
tax authority’s statements, nor is he required to delve into questions concerning
a  foreign  jurisdiction’s  domestic  law.    Where  the  foreign  tax  authority

 8

provides an explanation to clarify any doubts that may arise, the Comptroller is
not  obliged  to  embark  on  a  substantive  inquiry  into  the  correctness  of  that
explanation.

23.
The obligation to exchange information that is “foreseeably relevant”
pursuant  to  an  EOI  Instrument  is  mandatory.    Some  DTAs  use  the  word
“necessary”  for  “foreseeably  relevant”  and  these  terms  are  considered
equivalent.    The Schedule to the Disclosure Rules in Appendix 1 specifically
set  forth  the  particulars  that  a  requesting  jurisdiction  should  provide  to
demonstrate  that  the  standard  of  “foreseeable  relevance”  is  met.    The  term
“foreseeable  relevance”  should  be  evaluated  with  reference  to  the  strength  of
the information supplied in the disclosure request.

In July 2012, the OECD approved an update to the EOI Article of the
24.
OECD  Model  Tax  Convention  and  its  commentary.    The  2012  version  has
provided more detailed interpretation of the prevailing standard of “foreseeable
relevance”.    It  has  elaboration  on  how  a  request  which  relates  to  a  group  of
taxpayers  not  individually  identified  should  be  treated.    According  to  the
interpretation, a group request should be accepted if the requesting jurisdiction
could  substantiate  that  the  request  is  related  to  tax  purposes  and  that  it  could
meet the standard of “foreseeable relevance”.

the royalties.

If  the  recipient  of  the  royalties  was  the  beneficial  owner  of  the
royalties  and  was  a  resident  of  Hong  Kong,  the  recipient  would  be
entitled to a lower withholding tax rate in Jurisdiction-F.    Since the
information was foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions
of  the  DTA  between  Hong  Kong  and  Jurisdiction-F,  it  would  be
provided to Jurisdiction-F.

27.

Common types of information may include:

(a)

tax return and financial statements;

(b)       tax paid abroad;

(c)       residence status;

(d)       property owned or used;

(e)       income and expenses;

(g)       directors and shareholders of companies;

(h)       company registration;

(i)        accounts including business records and invoices.

Bank information

Hong  Kong  has  never  had  any  bank  secrecy

28.
  The
Commissioner has all along been empowered to collect information from banks
for  the  purposes  of  administration  of  taxes  under  the  IRO.    If  the  bank
information is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of a DTA or
to  the  administration  or  enforcement  of  the  tax  laws  of  the  requesting
jurisdiction, it would be provided to the requesting jurisdiction.

laws.

Taxes covered

29.
Information  exchanged  under  an  EOI  instrument  made  by  an  order
pursuant to section 49(1A) of the IRO by the CE-in-Council may relate to any
tax imposed by the laws of Hong Kong or a territory outside Hong Kong.

Since  Hong  Kong  has  a  simple  tax  system  under  which  only  three
30.
direct  taxes  are  imposed  (i.e.  profits  tax,  salaries  tax  and  property  tax),  it  is
considered that EOI for the purposes of these direct taxes would suffice and the
EOI  provisions  are  restricted  to  similar  direct  taxes  covered  by  the  EOI
Instruments.    However,  the  tax  systems  of  most  jurisdictions  are  far  more
complex than that of Hong Kong and have a much wider range of tax types (e.g.
value-added tax, wealth tax, inheritance tax, etc.), and sometimes have different
level  of  taxes  (e.g.  federal  and  state  taxes).    Understandably,  the  tax
authorities  of  these  jurisdictions  would  like  to  have  information  from  Hong
Kong to assist their investigation of tax evasion cases concerning income taxes
and taxes of other types (i.e. taxes which are not income tax in nature but are
covered by the relevant EOI Instrument).

31.
After enactment of the 2013 Amendment Ordinance, the coverage of
tax  types  for  exchanging  information  is  extended  to  any  tax  imposed  by  the
laws  of  Hong  Kong  or  any  territory  with  which  Hong  Kong  has  an  EOI
arrangement.    In  this  respect,  Hong  Kong  will  have  more  flexibility  to
persuade the key jurisdictions to commence DTA negotiations with Hong Kong,
to  meet  the  practical  needs  of  these  jurisdictions  and  to  ensure  that  EOI

 11

arrangements are on par with the international standard.    In practice, a positive
listing approach may be adopted to set out the tax types to be covered in each
DTA or TIEA.    The relevant DTA or TIEA will be implemented as subsidiary
legislation domestically subject to negative vetting by the Legislative Council.

Paragraph 1 of Article 2 of the Convention lists the main categories
32.
of  taxes  covered  by  the  Convention.    The  taxes  to  which  the  Convention
applies  are  listed  in  Annex  A  of  the  Convention6.    These  are  the  taxes  in
relation to which assistance is expected to be received.    Since Hong Kong has
made reservation under paragraph (1)(a) of Article 30 of the Convention, Hong
Kong  is  not  obligated  to  provide  any  form  of  assistance,  including  EOI  on
request,  in  relation  to  the  taxes  of  other  jurisdictions  described  in  paragraph
(1)(b) of Article 2 of the Convention.

Persons covered

EOI is not limited to information relating to the affairs of residents of
33.
Hong  Kong  and  the  territory  concerned.    The  tax  administration  of  the
territory  concerned  often  has  an  interest  in  receiving  information  on  activities
carried out between a company in Hong Kong and a particular person resident
in  a  third  jurisdiction  because  the  tax  liability  of  the  latter  as  a  non-resident
taxpayer is at issue.    There are also circumstances under which a person of a
third jurisdiction is interposed in the chain of information flow.    In a DTA, the
EOI  Article  invariably  stipulates  that  the  EOI  is  not  restricted  by  Article  1,
which defines the persons covered by the DTA.

The information requested by Jurisdiction-F1 should be relevant in a
comparability analysis for its transfer pricing audit.    If Hong Kong
had  the  information  or  could  obtain  such  information  on  prices
charged by Company-F2 on its unrelated distributors in Hong Kong,
such  information  had  to  be  provided  regardless  of  whether  such
distributors were residents of Hong Kong under the relevant DTA or
residents of a third jurisdiction.

Example 4

The tax administration of Jurisdiction-F1 was conducting an investigation
into the tax affairs of Mr. F1.    There was evidence that Mr. F1 was the
beneficial  owner  of  several  bank  accounts  maintained  with  Bank-HK  in
Hong  Kong  which  were  held  by  nominee  companies  incorporated  in
Jurisidiction-F2 and Jurisdiction-F3.    Taxes were levied on a world-wide
basis in  Jurisidiction-F1.    Hong  Kong  was  requested by Jurisdiction-F1
under  the  Convention  to  provide  the  bank  account  opening
information and bank statements of these bank accounts.

The  information  requested  under  the  Convention  could  assist
Jurisdiction-F1 to identify any undisclosed income and assets outside
Jurisdiction-F1,  beneficially  owned  by  Mr.  F1,  which  would  be
subject to tax in Jurisdiction-F1.    This information was foreseeably
relevant  to  the  administration  or  enforcement  of  the  domestic  tax
laws  of  Jurisdiction-F1.    The  information  would  be  provided  to
Jurisdiction-F1.

Possession and control

34.
The  information  gathering  power  of  the  Commissioner  is  not
restricted  to  information  in  the  possession  of  a  person  but  also  information
under  the  person’s  control.    The  term  “possession”  does  not  mean  physical
possession  only.    It  should  also  bear  the  meaning  of  legal  possession  (i.e.
possession which is recognised and protected as such by law).    If a person is
the owner of the information which at the material time is kept by other party,
say  the  record  books  held  by  his  auditors  or  lawyers,  the  person  is  still  in
possession of such information, and he has to provide such information to the
Commissioner.

 13

Hong  Kong  is  not  obligated  to  provide  information  that  is  neither
35.
held by the Commissioner nor is in the possession or control of persons within
Hong Kong.

Example 5

Mr. H owned all the shares in Company-F and was the sole director
of  Company-F,  a  corporation
in  an  offshore
jurisdiction.    The  assessor  requested  Mr.  H  to  provide  documents
which were in the possession or control of Company-F.

incorporated

If  the  documents  were  in  the  actual  possession  of  Mr.  H,  he  had  to
disclose  and  produce  all  relevant  documents.    If  Company-F  was
the alter ego of Mr. H so that he had unfettered control of Company
F’s affairs, he had to disclose and produce all relevant documents.

Example 6

incorporated

Company-HK was incorporated in Hong Kong whereas Company-F
was
Company-HK  owned  70  percent  of  the  shares  in  Company-F.    To
verify  the  transactions  between  Company-HK  and  Company-F,  the
assessor required the accounting records of Company-F.

jurisdiction  outside  Hong  Kong.

in  a

Though Company-HK was the majority shareholder of Company-F,
Company-HK could not be said to have possession or control of the
accounting  records  of  Company-F.    Therefore,  the  assessor  would
not  ask  Company-HK  to  provide  the  accounting  records  of
Company-F  but  would  make  use  of  the  EOI  mechanism,  where
appropriate,  to  obtain  the  accounting  records  of  Company-F.
Company-HK, however, was expected to provide copies of financial
statements of Company-F it received as a shareholder.

Information held by nominees, agents, fiduciaries and ownership information

36.
Hong  Kong  is  required  to  provide  information  even  though  the
information is held by a nominee or a person acting in an agency or fiduciary
capacity, or relates to an ownership interest.

 14

Confidentiality of information received

The  international  standard  for  EOI  requires  that  information  should
37.
be  kept  confidential,  and  that  information  should  be  treated  “as  secret  in  the
same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws”.    In the Hong
Kong  context,  tax  secrecy  refers  to  the  provisions  mainly  under  the  IRO  that
ensure  that  information  relating  to  a  taxpayer  and  his  affairs  remains
confidential  and  is  protected  from  unauthorised  disclosure.    Appendix  2  sets
forth the data security and confidentiality measures adopted in Hong Kong.

38.
It  is  fundamental  for  the  co-operation  in  matters  of  information
exchange that such confidential information continues to enjoy a similar level
of  protection  when  it  is  exchanged  with  Hong  Kong.    For  this  reason,  any
information supplied by a requested jurisdiction to Hong Kong will be treated
as confidential.    Confidentiality is preserved by the EOI Instrument concerned
and the applicable domestic laws of Hong Kong.

39.
The  confidentiality  provisions  of  an  EOI  Instrument  create
obligations  under  international  law.    Information  received  by  Hong  Kong
under an EOI Instrument shall be treated as confidential and may be disclosed
only to persons or tax authorities concerned with the assessment, collection and
enforcement  of  the  taxes  (including  the  prosecution  or  the  determination  of
appeals)  and  the  information  may  be  used  only  for  such  purposes.    The
competent authorities may disclose the information in public court proceedings
or in judicial decisions.    However, the information should not be disclosed to
any  other  person,  entity,  authority  or  jurisdiction.    These  are  the  safeguards
provided under the EOI Instruments.

40.
The confidentiality rules apply to all types of information, including
both information provided in a request, for instance, competent authority letters
requesting information, and information transmitted in response to a request.

41.
To  gather  information,  a  formal  notice  will  be  issued  to  the
information  holder  requesting  the  relevant  information  or  documents.    The
Commissioner  will  only  disclose  the  minimum  information  contained  in  a
disclosure request (but not the letter itself) to enable the information holder to
locate  the  requested  information  and  respond  to  the  notice.    The  type  and
amount  of  information  to  be  disclosed  in  the  notice  depends  on  the

 15

circumstances  of  each  case  and  would  not  normally  include  the  name  of  the
requesting  jurisdiction.    If  the  information  holder  has  reasonable  grounds  to
know  the  name  of  the  requesting  jurisdiction  (e.g.  claiming  privilege  against
self-incrimination), the Commissioner is prepared to take a pragmatic approach
to  deal  with  the  situation  after  striking  a  balance  between  the  international
standard  and  information  holder’s  need.    If  the  reasons  provided  by  the
information  holder  is  acceptable,  the  Commissioner  would  seek  prior  consent
of the requesting jurisdiction before disclosure of its name.    If the requesting
jurisdiction  declines  to  give  any  consent,  the  Commissioner  will  inform  the
information  holder  accordingly.    If  the  information  holder  refuses  to  provide
the  information  requested  as  the  name  of  the  requesting  jurisdiction  is  not
known,  the  Commissioner  will,  having  considered  the  circumstances  of  the
case,  decline  the  disclosure  request  because  it  could  not  disclose  to  the
information holder the name of the requesting jurisdiction, which is considered
necessary to facilitate the gathering of the requested information.

Use of information for other purposes

42.
Any  information  received  under  a  disclosure  request  shall  be
disclosed  only  to  persons  or  authorities  (including  courts  and  administrative
bodies)  concerned  with  the  assessment  or  collection  of,  the  enforcement  or
prosecution  in  respect  of,  or  the  determination  of  appeals  in  relation  to,  the
taxes referred to in the EOI Instrument.    Such persons or authorities shall use
the information only for such purposes.

Where documents contain data of a third party which will be useful
43.
in verifying the accuracy of information shown in the documents or otherwise
assist in the proper administration or enforcement of the domestic tax laws of
the requesting jurisdiction, the data will not be crossed out and the documents
will  be  transmitted  to  the  requesting  jurisdiction  in  the  manner  produced.
Typical examples are sales invoices and multi-partite service contracts.

44.
Where the requesting jurisdiction lodges a request for information in
respect  of  that  “third  party”  which  makes  any  reference  to  or  which  relies  on
any  data  aforementioned,  such  request  will  be  regarded  as  a  separate  request.
If the requested information relating to the “third party” is foreseeably relevant
to the administration or enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the requesting
jurisdiction,  such  information  on  the  “third  party”  may  be  provided  to  the

 16

requesting jurisdiction.

In  general,  the  information  obtained  under  an  EOI  Instrument  can
45.
only  be  used  for  the  purposes  provided  in  that  instrument.    The  primary
purpose will be linked to the administration, assessment and enforcement of tax.
However, the use of information so obtained for other non-tax related purposes
may be allowed under an EOI Instrument where:

(a)       the relevant arrangement contains non-tax use provision;

(b)       the  domestic  laws  of  both  the  receiving  jurisdiction  and  the

supplying jurisdiction permit such use; and

(c)       prior authorisation is given by the competent authority of the

supplying jurisdiction.

As far as other non-tax related purposes are concerned, in the case of
46.
Hong  Kong,  it  does  not  merely  mean  any  purpose  other  than  a  tax  related
purpose.    Such  non-tax  related  purposes  must  be  purposes  for  which  the  tax
information exchanged may be so used under the laws of Hong Kong and the
EOI  partner.    Under  the  laws  of  Hong  Kong,  tax  information  may  only  be
used  for  limited  non-tax  related  purposes,  such  as  recovery  of  proceeds  from
drug trafficking, organised and serious crimes and terrorist acts under the Drug
Trafficking  (Recovery  of  Proceeds)  Ordinance  (Cap.  405),  the  Organized  and
Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) and the United Nations (Anti-Terrorism
Measures) Ordinance (Cap. 575) respectively.

There  may  be  times  when  the  tax  information  provided  by  an  EOI
47.
partner under an EOI Instrument is of use to a law enforcement agency in Hong
Kong  dealing  with  the  enforcement  of  the  laws  aforementioned,  in  particular
the  Joint  Financial  Intelligence  Unit  (JFIU)  jointly  run  by  the  Hong  Kong
Police Force and the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department.    However,
the provisions of an EOI Instrument as explained would take precedence over
the aforementioned laws which require disclosure of tax information to the JFIU.
As a rule, the Commissioner would only disclose the information to the JFIU if:

(a)       the relevant EOI Instrument contains non-tax use provision;

 17

(b)       the domestic laws of the supplying jurisdiction permit the use

of the information for the said non-tax related purposes; and

(c)       the  competent  authority  of

the  supplying

jurisdiction

authorises such use.

48.
Likewise, a requesting jurisdiction may only use the tax information
obtained from Hong Kong under an EOI Instrument for the said non-tax related
purposes if the EOI Instrument contains non-tax use provision and such use is
permitted under the domestic laws of the requesting jurisdiction.    In addition,
on  every  occasion  of  intended  use  of  tax  information  for  the  said  non-tax
related  purposes,  the  competent  authority  of  the  requesting  jurisdiction  has  to
seek  prior  authorisation  from  the  Commissioner.    The  relevant  law  enforcement
agencies and the Department of Justice in Hong Kong will be consulted.    The
Commissioner  will  only  indicate  consent  to  the  competent  authority  of  the
requesting  jurisdiction  if  the  relevant  government  departments  raise  no
objection and  such  use of information is covered by  the current exemption  as
provided under section 58 of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486)
in relation to crime under the laws of a place outside  Hong  Kong  with which
Hong Kong has in place legal or law enforcement cooperation.

Disclosure to oversight authorities

49.
The  Convention  and  the  EOI  Article  of  the  OECD  Model  Tax
Convention  permit  disclosure  of  information  exchanged  to  the  oversight
authorities of the requesting jurisdiction.    Oversight authorities are authorities
that supervise the tax administration and enforcement authorities as part of the
general  administration  of  the  governments  of  the  requesting  and  requested
jurisdictions.    Hong  Kong  adopts  a  more  prudent  approach  in  the  DTA
negotiations  with  other  jurisdictions.    Disclosure  to  oversight  authorities  is
accepted  if  there  are  legitimate  reasons  (e.g.  administrative  or  governmental
structure of the DTA jurisdiction permits or requires the oversight authorities to
have access to tax information).

Disclosure to third jurisdictions

To  ensure  the  strictest  confidentiality,  information  shall  not  be
50.
disclosed  to  any  third  jurisdiction  for  any  purpose.    In  some  DTAs  entered

 18

into by Hong Kong, it is stated in the EOI Article that information shall not be
disclosed  to  any  third  jurisdiction  without  the  consent  of  the  requested
jurisdiction.    The  same  approach  is  also  followed  in  a  TIEA  and  the
Convention.    The  Commissioner  does  not  envisage  any  circumstances  under
which Hong Kong would give consent for such disclosure.

Retrospective effect

The EOI provisions under an EOI Instrument shall have effect only
51.
after the instrument enters into force.    Any EOI will only be possible after the
date  on  which  the  EOI  provisions  have  effect  (i.e.  the  effective  date).    The
effective  date  is  stipulated  under  the  Article  on  Entry  into  Force  in  the  EOI
Instrument.    Regarding the information that may be disclosed in response to a
disclosure request, section 4 of the Disclosure Rules provides that:

“The  Commissioner  must  not  disclose  any  information  in  response
to a disclosure request unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the
information relates to –

(a)

(b)

the  relevant
the  carrying  out  of
arrangements  in  respect  of  any  period  that  starts  after  the
arrangements have come into operation; or

the  provisions  of

the  administration  or  enforcement  of  the  tax  law  of  the
requesting  government’s  territory  in  respect  of  any  period
that  starts  after  the  relevant  arrangements  have  come  into
operation.”

52.
The provisions of section 4 of the Disclosure Rules however do not
preclude disclosure  of information that precedes the effective date  of the EOI
Instrument,  provided  that  such  information  relates  to  the  carrying  out  of  the
provisions of a DTA or the administration or enforcement of the tax law of the
requesting  jurisdiction  in  respect  of  any  period  that  starts  after  the  EOI
Instrument has come into operation.

 19

53.

In summary, information that can be exchanged includes:

(a)

(b)

information relating to any period that starts after the effective
date of an EOI Instrument;

information that exists or generated prior to the effective date
of  an  EOI  Instrument  if  the  information  is  foreseeably
relevant for the carrying out of the provisions of a DTA or to
the  tax  administration  or  enforcement  of  the  tax  law  of  the
requesting  jurisdiction  concerning  taxes  imposed  in  a  period
that starts after the EOI Instrument came into effect.

Under the Convention, for tax matters involving intentional conduct
54.
which  is  liable  to  prosecution  under  the  criminal  laws  of  the  requesting
jurisdiction,  information  relating  to  taxable  periods  beginning  on  or  after  1
January of the third  year (i.e. 1 January 2015) preceding the one in which the
Convention entered into force in respect of Hong Kong (i.e. 1 September 2018)
is required to be provided to the requesting jurisdiction.

Example 7

interest

Company-F was a resident of Jurisdiction-F which had a DTA with
Hong  Kong.    The  relevant  DTA  had  effect  in  Hong  Kong  for  any
year of assessment beginning on or after 1 April 2016.    Company-F
opened  a  savings  account  with  a  bank  in  Hong  Kong  on  1  March
  Jurisdiction-F  was
2015  and  received
investigating the tax affairs of Company-F for the period from April
2016 onwards and suspected that Company-F had failed to report its
worldwide income attributable to the interest income arising in Hong
Kong.    Jurisdiction-F  requested  Hong  Kong  to  provide  bank
statements of the account in Hong Kong for the period from 1 April
2016 to 31 March 2017 as well as a copy of the signature card for
the account in question.

therefrom.

Pursuant to section 4 of the Disclosure Rules, Hong Kong should be
able to provide the bank statements for the period from 1 April 2016
to 31 March 2017 and a copy of the signature card for the account in
question.    Although  the  signature  card  was  generated  prior  to  the

 20

effective  date  of  the  DTA,  it  could  be  exchanged  because  it  was
foreseeably  relevant to the administration or  enforcement of the tax
laws  of  Jurisdiction-F  in  respect  of  a  period  that  started  after  the
DTA came into operation.

Example 8

Company-HK  received  dividends  on  1  June  2018  paid  by
Company-F,  a  resident  of  Jurisdiction-F  which  had  a  DTA  with
Hong  Kong.    Company-HK  made  a  claim  for  DTA  benefits  (i.e.
reduced  withholding  tax  rate  on  dividends  under  the  provisions  of
the relevant DTA that came into effect on 1 April 2017).    To verify
the  identity  and  resident  status  of  Company-HK,  Jurisdiction-F
requested  Hong  Kong  to  provide,  among  others,  a  copy  of  the
Certificate  of  Incorporation  of  Company-HK  as  evidence  that
Company-HK  was  a  resident  of  Hong  Kong.    The  Certificate  of
Incorporation of Company-HK was issued on 1 April 2015.

Although  the  Certificate  of  Incorporation  of  Company-HK  was
issued before 1 April 2017, Hong Kong should provide the document
to  Jurisdiction-F  since  it  was  foreseeably  relevant  for  carrying  out
the  provisions  of  the  DTA  (i.e.  Jurisdiction-F  had  to  ascertain
whether  Company-HK  was  eligible  for  claiming  tax  benefits  under
the provisions of the DTA after 1 April 2017).

ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES

No  obligation  to  carry  out  measures  at  variance  with  domestic  laws  and
administrative practices

The  Commissioner  is  not  obligated  to  carry  out  administrative

55.
measures  at  variance  with  Hong  Kong’s  laws  and  administrative  practices.
The  underlying  rationale  is  that  a  requested  jurisdiction  should  be  required  to
do  no  more,  but  also  no  less,  than  it  would  if  its  own  taxation  was  at  stake.
Thus,  where  the  information  in  the  possession  of  the  Commissioner  is  not
sufficient  to  reply  to  a  request,  the  Commissioner  should  take  all  relevant
information  gathering  measures  as  the  Commissioner  would  take  for  the  tax

 21

purposes in Hong Kong.    Item 7(a) of the Schedule to the Disclosure Rules in
Appendix 1 specifically sets forth that a requesting jurisdiction should provide
a  statement  to  confirm  that  the  disclosure  request  complies  with  its  laws  and
administrative practices.

LIMITATIONS ON EOI

Obligation lifted

56.
In  the  Manual  on  the  Implementation  of  EOI  Provisions  for  Tax
Purposes - Module on General and Legal Aspect of EOI, the OECD explicitly
states  that  the  legal  obligation  to  supply  information  is  lifted  in  a  limited
number  of  situations.    These  exceptions  are  adopted  in  full  in  the  EOI
Instruments.    In the rare cases where the exceptions apply, the Commissioner
or  the  competent  authority  of  the  jurisdiction  concerned  are  not  obligated  to
provide information.    The Commissioner will act within the framework of the
EOI  Instrument  and  will  not  provide  the  information  where  there  is  no
obligation to do so.

Reciprocity

57.
The  Commissioner,  when  collecting  information  for  the  requesting
jurisdiction,  is  only  obligated  to  obtain  and  provide  such  information  that  the
requesting  jurisdiction  could  itself  obtain  under  its  own  laws  in  similar
circumstances.    It  is  stipulated  in  the  EOI  Instruments  that  there  is  no
obligation to supply information that the requesting jurisdiction itself could not
obtain in the normal course of administration.

58.
The underlying idea of the concept of reciprocity is that a requesting
jurisdiction cannot take advantage of the information system of Hong Kong if
Hong  Kong’s  information  system  is  wider  than  its  own  system.    The
Commissioner  may  refuse  to  provide  information  where  the  requesting
jurisdiction is precluded by law from obtaining or providing the information or
where  the  requesting  jurisdiction’s  administrative  practices  (e.g.  failure  to
provide sufficient administrative resources) result in a lack of reciprocity.

The  requesting  jurisdiction  is  required  to  provide  a  statement
59.
confirming that the reciprocity condition is met.    Item 7(b) of the Schedule to

 22

the  Disclosure  Rules  in  Appendix  1  specifically  sets  forth  that  the  requesting
jurisdiction  should  confirm  in  a  statement  that  the  information  is  obtainable
under its domestic laws or in the normal course of its administrative practices.
The  request  may  be  declined  if  there  are  grounds  for  believing  that  the
statements are clearly inaccurate.

Public policy

The  Commissioner  is  not  obligated  to  supply  information  if  the
60.
disclosure  of  such  information  would  be  contrary  to  public  policy  (ordre
public).    “Public policy” generally refers to the vital interests of a country, for
instance where information requested relates to a state secret.    This limitation
rarely arises in practice.

Trade, business and other secrets

Hong  Kong  has  made  clear  with  the  EOI  partners  that  there  is  no
61.
obligation  to  supply  information  which  would  disclose  any  trade,  business,
industrial,  commercial  or  professional  secret  or  trade  process.    Whether  any
piece  of  information  amounts  to  a  “trade  or  business  secret”  should  not  be
interpreted  in  too  wide  a  sense.    According  to  the  commentary  to  the  EOI
Article  of  the  OECD  Model  Tax  Convention,  a  trade  or  business  secret  is
generally understood to mean facts and circumstances that are of considerable
economic importance and that can be exploited practically and the unauthorised
use  of  which  may  lead  to  serious  damage.    Financial  information,  including
books  and  records,  does  not  by  its  nature  constitute  a  trade,  business  or  other
secret.

The Commissioner will determine whether or not to pass on sensitive
62.
information.
  Tax  secrecy  protects  trade  and  business  secrets  in  all
jurisdictions alike, when such secrets come into the hands of the tax authorities.
It is not expected that tax authorities of an EOI partner would demand access to
trade and business secrets in the first place, as their information seeking powers
generally  permit  the  collection  of  “tax  information”  only.    In  any  event,  a
person  can  dispute  the  supply  of  any  information  claimed  to  be  trade  or
business  secrets,  or  initiate  legal  actions  to  challenge  the  Commissioner’s
actions  in  collecting  such  information.    The  issue  will  ultimately  be  decided
by the courts.

 23

Example 9

Jurisdiction-F,  which  had  a  DTA  with  Hong  Kong,  requested
commercial  information  concerning  the  manufacture  of  a  drug  by
Company-HK,  which  was  a  pharmaceutical  company  resident  in
Hong Kong.    As a result, the Commissioner  was exposed to highly
valuable commercial information of the drug itself.

Such  commercial  information  would  be  subject  to  the  limitations
described  above  and  the  Commissioner  could  refuse  to  supply  the
information  to  Jurisdiction-F,  or  at  least  excise  that  part  of  the
information from the response to Jurisdiction-F.

Legal professional privilege

63.
In  addition  to  the  safeguards  provided  for  in  EOI  Instruments  that
there  is  no  obligation  to  supply  information  which  would  disclose  any  trade,
business,  industrial,  commercial  or  professional  secret  or  trade  process,  the
Commissioner  will  not  exchange  information  covered  by  legal  professional
privilege.    The general law on legal professional privilege is maintained under
the EOI regime.    The restriction on disclosure of legally  privileged  materials
is legally binding on the Commissioner.

64.
According  to  the  commentary  to  the  EOI  provisions  of  the  OECD
Model  Tax  Convention  and  the  OECD  Model  Agreement  on  Exchange  of
Information  on  Tax  Matters,  a  requested  jurisdiction  may  decline  to  disclose
information  relating  to  confidential  communications  between  attorneys,
solicitors or other admitted legal representatives in their role as such and their
clients  to  the  extent  that  the  communications  are  protected  from  disclosure
under domestic law.    In this regard, it is relevant to note that domestically, the
protection  of  legal  professional  privilege  has  all  along  been  afforded  under
section  51(4A)  of  the  IRO,  which  states  that  “nothing  in  subsection  (4)  shall
require  disclosure  by  counsel  or  solicitor  of  any  privileged  information  or
communication given or made to him in that capacity”.    Hence, under the IRO,
the  Commissioner  has  no  power  to  require  furnishing  of  information  that  is
subject to legal professional privilege.

 24

NOTIFICATION AND REVIEW SYSTEM

Right to be informed about information to be or has been exchanged

65.
The Disclosure Rules  provide for a variety of procedural rights and
safeguards  for  persons  affected  by  the  EOI  mechanism.    Such  rights  and
safeguards  include  a  right  to  be  informed  about  the  information  to  be  or  has
been exchanged, a right to request the Commissioner to amend the information
to be or has been exchanged, and a right to request the Financial Secretary to
review the Commissioner’s decision.

Few  OECD  countries  have  a  notification  and  review  mechanism  in
66.
place.    Given  the  possible  implications  of  these  rights  and  safeguards,  Hong
Kong’s  EOI  partners  have  been  informed  of  Hong  Kong’s  legislation  and
administrative  practices  concerning  the  notification  and  review  mechanism  in
DTA  or  TIEA  negotiations  and  thereafter  whenever  the  relevant  rules  are
modified.    Reservation has been made under paragraph (3) of Article 4 of the
Convention  that  Hong  Kong  resident  may  be  informed  before  information
concerning that resident is transmitted to the requesting jurisdiction.

Notice of disclosure request

Subject  to  the  exceptional  circumstances  in  paragraphs  68  and  69,
67.
the Commissioner  has  to notify the person,  who is the subject of a  disclosure
request, prior to the disclosure of any information in response to the disclosure
request.    In  practice,  the  Commissioner  will  issue  the  notice  of  disclosure
request  as  soon  as  practicable  after  the  disclosure  request  in  question  is
approved.    The Commissioner must also notify the person that the person may
request a copy of the information that the Commissioner is prepared to disclose
to the requesting jurisdiction.    The request for a copy of the information must
be made by a notice in writing given to the Commissioner within 14 days after
the notice of disclosure request is given to the person.

request if the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that:

The  Commissioner  is  not  required  to  serve  a  notice  of  disclosure

(a)

all  the  addresses  of  the  person  known  to  the  Commissioner
are inadequate for the purpose of giving the notification; or

 25

(b)

the notification is likely to undermine the chance of success of the
investigation in relation to which the disclosure request is made.

The  Commissioner  will  only  notify  the  person  at  the  time  when

69.
information relating to the person is disclosed to the requesting jurisdiction if:

(a)

(b)

it  is  not  practicable  to  give  the  notification  and  to  determine
the subsequent requests that the person may make in relation
to the information under the Disclosure Rules within the time
constraint; and

the failure of the Commissioner in disclosing the information
to  the  requesting  jurisdiction within  the  time  constraint  is
likely  to  frustrate  the  efforts  of  the  requesting  jurisdiction in
enforcing its tax laws.

70.
Where  the  person  has  requested  a  copy  of  the  information  to  be
disclosed,  the  Commissioner  must,  within  a  reasonable  time,  by  a  notice  in
writing given to the person, provide the person with a copy of the information
that the Commissioner is prepared to disclose to the requesting jurisdiction.

Request for amendments

71.
The person may request the Commissioner to amend any part of the
information  to  be  exchanged,  by  giving  a  written  notice  to  the  Commissioner
within 21 days after the person is given a copy of the information.    The person
making the request shall specify the manner in which the information is to be
amended  and  the  grounds  for  the  request,  and  submit  any  documentary
evidence in support of the request.    The grounds for a request for amendments
should be that:

(a)

(b)

the information or that part of the information does not relate
to the person; or

the  information  or  that  part  of  the  information  is  factually
incorrect.

72.
The  Commissioner  may,  on  the  basis  of  the  factual  evidence
available,  approve  the  request  for  amendment  fully  or  partially  or  refuse  the

 26

request.    The  Commissioner’s  decision,  the  reasons  therefor  together  with  a
copy  of  the  amended  information,  if  any,  will  then  be  given  to  the  person  by
way of a notice (notice of decision).

73.
The  person  has  the  same  right  for  requesting  a  copy  of  the
information and for requesting amendment where a notice of disclosure request
is served at the time of the disclosure of information (i.e. situation in paragraph 69).

If the Commissioner refuses the request of the person to amend any
74.
part of the information to be or has been disclosed in response to the disclosure
request,  that  person  may,  by  giving  a  written  notice  within  14  days  after  the
Commissioner’s notice of decision is given, request the Financial Secretary to
review the Commissioner’s decision.    The person must specify the manner in
which  the  information  is  to  be  amended  and  the  grounds  for  the  request,  and
submit  any  documentary  evidence  in  support  of  the  request.    It  is  also
necessary  to  send  a  copy  of  the  Commissioner’s  notice  of  decision  together
with the request to the Financial Secretary.    The address and contact details of
the office of the Financial Secretary are as follows:

25/F, Central Government Offices,
2 Tim Mei Avenue, Tamar, Hong Kong
2810 2589
2840 0569
fso@fso.gov.hk

Having considered the factual evidence, the Financial Secretary may
75.
approve the request for amendment fully or partially, or refuse the request.    A
written decision together with the reasons therefor will be given to the person
within a reasonable time.    The decision of the Financial Secretary is final.    In
this  administrative  review  procedure,  the  Financial  Secretary  is  bound  by  the
confidentiality obligation in the Official Secrets Ordinance (Cap. 521) and the
Commissioner will only disclose, on a confidential basis, minimum information
required  for  the  Financial  Secretary  to  determine  whether  the  grounds  for
amendment are valid or not.    In any event, all necessary information required
for determining the issue should have already  been provided by the person as
mentioned in paragraph 74.

PROCESSING OF DISCLOSURE REQUESTS

Approval of a disclosure request

Approval by the Commissioner or authorised officer

76.
Under section 3(1) of the Disclosure Rules, a disclosure request may
only  be  approved  by  the  Commissioner  personally,  or  by  an  officer  of  the
Inland Revenue Department not below the rank of chief assessor authorised in
writing  by  the  Commissioner  personally  (i.e.  authorised  officer).    In  this
connection, the Commissioner has authorised the Chief Assessor (Tax Treaty)
(CA(TT)) as an authorised officer.

Conditions for approval under section 3(2) of the Disclosure Rules

77.
First, the disclosure request  must comply with the provisions of the
relevant arrangement.    In this regard, the authorised officer should review the
provisions of the relevant EOI Instrument, including the Taxes Covered Article
and the protocol in the case of a DTA or a TIEA.

78.
Secondly,  the  disclosure  request  must  comply  with  the  applicable
procedures specified in any instrument that amends or supplements the relevant
  The  authorised  officer  should  review  the  protocol,
EOI  Instrument.
memorandum of understanding, agreed minutes of meeting or correspondence
subsequent to the signing of the relevant EOI Instrument, which may prescribe
the procedures applicable to a request for disclosure of information.

Thirdly,  the  authorised  officer  has  to  ensure  that  the  disclosure
79.
request  sets  out  the  particulars  prescribed  in  the  Schedule  to  the  Disclosure
Rules, which is a statutory requirement and is extracted at Appendix 1.    As a
rule,  the  requesting  jurisdiction  is  expected  to  provide  all  the  particulars,
applicable to the request concerned, as specified in the said Schedule.    Under
section  3(2)(b)  of  the  Disclosure  Rules,  the  Commissioner  may  permit
departure  from  this  requirement  on  reasonable  grounds.    The  requesting
jurisdiction is required to set out its grounds for waiver of provision of any of
the  particulars.    Approval  of  departure  would  depend  on  the  particular
circumstances  of  each  case.    As  a  bare  minimum,  the  Commissioner  would
require the following particulars to be provided in the disclosure request:

 28

(a)

the identity of the person who is the subject of the disclosure
request (i.e. subject person);

(b)

the purpose of the disclosure request;

(c)

the tax type concerned;

(d)

the tax period for which the information is requested;

(e)

the nature of the information requested; and

(f)

the  relevance  of  the  information  to  the  purpose  of  the
disclosure request.

One  possible  instance  in  which  the  Commissioner  may  permit
80.
departure  is  where  the  requesting  jurisdiction  has  supplied  the  name  of  the
person  believed  to  have  possession  or  control  of  the  information  requested
together with other essential particulars but has genuine difficulty in supplying
that person’s up-to-date address.    Though the Commissioner has delegated his
authority under the Disclosure Rules to the CA(TT), the Commissioner or the
Deputy  Commissioners  will  review  the  decision  of  the  CA(TT)  when  the
requested information is about to be sent to the requesting jurisdiction.

Administrative matters requiring special attention

Form and language of a disclosure request

81.
A  disclosure  request  must  be  made  in  writing  and  made  by  the
competent  authority  of  the  requesting  jurisdiction  as  required  in  the  relevant
EOI Instrument under which the disclosure request is made.    Unless otherwise
agreed, the disclosure request must be in the English language.

Request for not issuing notification or prior notification

82.
In  case  a  requesting  jurisdiction  requests  the  Commissioner  not  to
give a notification or prior notification on the ground that doing so would likely
undermine  the  chance  of  success  of  its  investigation  or  frustrate  the  timely
enforcement  of  its  tax  laws,  the  requesting  jurisdiction  should  substantiate  its
claim.

 29

Example 10

In  a  disclosure  request,  Jurisdiction-F  requested  Hong  Kong  not  to
give a notification to the subject person on the ground that doing so
would likely undermine the chance of success of its investigation.

Jurisdiction-F had to provide information and reasons to explain the
situation  (e.g.  why  it  was  believed  that  the  subject  person  would
destroy or deface records, whether similar offences were committed
in the past, or whether the subject person was the target of a covert
criminal  investigation).
  The  CA(TT)  must  be  satisfied  that
sufficient information is available to reasonably justify such requests.

Example 11

Jurisdiction-F,  which  had  a  DTA  with  Hong  Kong,  required  the
information  before  a  certain  date  because  there  was  an  imminent
statutory  time  limit  for  raising  the  relevant  tax  assessment  in
Jurisdiction-F.

The CA(TT) must be satisfied that the urgency is genuine and this is
not to be abused if the “urgency” is simply a result of deliberate or
undue delay in making a request.

83.
If  the  requesting  jurisdiction  claims  that  the  exception  rules  should
apply to a tax investigation case or an urgent request, details required in items
11  and  12  of  the  Schedule  to  the  Disclosure  Rules  in  Appendix  1  have  to  be
provided.

Amendments to the information disclosed

84.
The Commissioner has the obligation to provide all the relevant and
correct information to the requesting jurisdiction in response to a specific and
legitimate  request  for  tax  information.    For  those  cases  where  notification  is
made  to  the  subject  person  at  the  same  time  as  the  requested  information  is
disclosed  to  the  requesting  jurisdiction,  if  the  Commissioner  subsequently
approves, either fully or partially, the subject person’s request for amendment,
the  Commissioner  must,  within  a  reasonable  time,  disclose  the  amended

 30

information to the requesting jurisdiction in accordance with section 9(5) of the
Disclosure  Rules.    Likewise,  where  the  subject  person  requests  the  Financial
Secretary  to  direct  the  Commissioner  to  make  the  amendments  and  the
Financial  Secretary  approves  the  request,  either  fully  or  partially,  the
Commissioner  must,  within  a  reasonable
the  amended
information  to  the  requesting  jurisdiction  in  accordance  with  section  10(8)  of
the Disclosure Rules.

time,  disclose

However, the Commissioner is under no obligation to provide further
85.
information  that  only  came  to  his  knowledge  after  the  disclosure  request  has
been  fully  complied  with  based  on  the  then  available  information.    The
Commissioner,  therefore,  will  not  communicate  any  such  after-acquired
information.

Standard response time

The  Global  Forum  requires  that  a  jurisdiction’s  internal  procedures
86.
cannot  unduly  delay  effective  EOI.    The  standard  response  time  set  by  the
OECD is 90 days after the receipt of a disclosure request.

87.
The  time  required  to  obtain  tax  information  in  pursuance  of  a
disclosure  request  depends  on  whether  the  information  is  available  in  the  tax
files of the Department or the information has to be obtained from the taxpayer
or any other parties.    The Commissioner will try to comply with the standard
response  time  as  far  as  possible.    If  the  information  is  unable  to  be  provided
within the 90-day period, the requesting jurisdiction will be informed with the
reasons for not being able to do so upon the expiration of that period.

Dispatch of requested information

  The  officers  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Department  are  obliged  to
88.
comply  with  the  provisions  of  the  relevant  EOI  Instruments  when  processing
disclosure requests.    To ensure that the information to be exchanged is proper
in  all  respects,  all  replies  to  the  requesting  jurisdictions  will  be  reviewed  and
approved by the Deputy Commissioners.

 31

RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS

Business records

89.
Section 51C of the IRO requires, among others, a person carrying on
a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong to keep sufficient records in the
English or Chinese language of the person’s income and expenditure to enable
the  assessable  profits  of  such  trade,  profession  or  business  to  be  readily
ascertained.    Such records shall be retained for a period of not less than seven
years after the completion of the transactions, acts or operations to which they
relate.

Rent records

90.
Section 51D of the IRO requires, among others, a person who is the
owner  of  a  property  situated  in  Hong  Kong  to  keep  sufficient  records  in  the
English or Chinese language of the consideration, in money or money’s worth,
payable or deemed to be payable to the person, to the person’s order or for the
person’s  benefit  in  respect  of  the  right  of  use  of  that  property  to  enable  the
assessable value of that property to be readily ascertained.    Such records shall
be retained for a period of not less than seven years after the completion of the
transactions, acts or operations to which they relate.

INFORMATION COLLECTION

For domestic tax purposes

91.
Section 51(4)(a) provides that for domestic tax purposes (i.e. profits
tax,  salaries  tax  and  property  tax  purposes),  any  information  in  possession  or
control  by  a  person  in  Hong  Kong,  which  may  affect  any  liability,
responsibility or obligation of any person under the IRO, shall be disclosed to
the  Commissioner.    Section  51(4)(b)  provides  that  an  assistant  commissioner
may give notice in writing to such person, or to such other person, requiring the
person,  at  a  time  and  place  to  be  named  by  the  assistant  commissioner,  to
attend  and  be  examined,  and  upon  such  examination  to  answer  truthfully  all
questions  put  to  the  person,  respecting  any  matter  which  may  affect  any
liability, responsibility or obligation of any person under the IRO.

 32

For overseas tax purposes

Section  51(4AA)  provides  that  the  powers  in  section  51(4)  can  be
92.
applied  for  the  purposes  of  obtaining  full  information  in  regard  to  the  matter
concerned  that  may  affect  any  liability,  responsibility  or  obligation  of  the
person concerned under the laws of a territory outside Hong Kong concerning
any tax of that territory if:

(a)     arrangements  having  effect  under  section  49(1A)  are  made

with the government of that territory; and

(b)

that tax is the subject of a provision of the arrangements that
requires  disclosure  of  information  concerning  tax  of  that
territory.

Information in existence

  According  to  the  commentary  to  the  EOI  Article  of  the  OECD
93.
Model  Tax  Convention,  a  requested  jurisdiction  is  not  obliged  to  provide
information  in  circumstances  where  it  has  attempted  to  obtain  the  requested
information  but  finds  that  the  information  no  longer  exists  following  the
expiration of domestic record retention period.    However, where the requested
information  is  still  available  notwithstanding  the  expiration  of  such  retention
period,  the  requested  jurisdiction  cannot  decline  to  exchange  the  information
available.    To comply with the international standard, the Commissioner shall
use its information gathering  measures to  gather the information  requested by
the EOI partner irrespective of whether the information could still be used for
domestic tax purposes in Hong Kong.

the
Commissioner  and  the  competent  authorities  of  EOI  partners  and  information
received  in  response  to  a  disclosure  request  is  treated  as  strictly  confidential
and  handled  with  care.    The  Department  has  developed  specific  rules  and
guidelines to safeguard the confidentiality of information exchanged under an
EOI Instrument.    The guidelines on confidentiality and handling of disclosure
requests  require  all  officers  involved  in  the  requests  of  their  confidentiality
duty and the steps to be taken when handling the requests.

3.
All  documentation  relating  to  the  processing  of  the  disclosure  request
should  be  kept  in  specific  confidential  folder.    The  folder  should  be  put  in  a
confidential envelope for transmission by hand.

After completion of action, the records of the disclosure request should

be  returned  to  proper  storage  (e.g.  filing  cabinets  with  lock  for  confidential
paper files) as soon as possible.

5.
An  EOI  register  is  maintained  by  the  Department  to  keep  track  of  all
disclosure  requests.    The  access  rights  to  the  EOI  register  are  restricted  to
officers handling the disclosure requests.

Any  unauthorised  access  to,  possession  or  use  of  the  information
