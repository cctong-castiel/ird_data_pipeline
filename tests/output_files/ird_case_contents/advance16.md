| (i) | marketing proposed products to clients;  
| (ii) | explaining products to clients;  
| (iii) | dealing with general enquiries and complains and reverting the same to A-London and  
| (iv) | communicating after-sales services requests to A-London.  
| The liaison staff is also involved in providing feedback from the clients to
Company A so as to modify the products and contacting the private banks and
financial institutions to market the products. The role of the liaison staff
is to act as a link between the clients and Company A in London. If the
clients have any specific requirements, the liaison staff can pass them on to
London for incorporation into the structure of the product. Clients are
located and contacted by the liaison staff in Hong Kong. Negotiations between
A-London and the clients are communicated through the liaison staff in Hong
Kong.

**Additional Notes:**

1. | The ruling given is specific to the facts of this case as presented to the Department in its ruling application. It should not be interpreted as a ruling for general application.  
---|---  
2. | In this case the specific ruling requested by the applicant is whether Company A carries on business in Hong Kong. The applicant did not request or present sufficient information for deciding whether Company A has profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong.  
3. | Whether an agency exists is a question of facts. In this case notwithstanding the express disclaimer of agency in the service agreement, the Department concluded that on the facts presented an agency could be implied.
