# INTRODUCTION
# Definition of rulings
In Countering Harmful Tax Practices More Effectively, Taking into Account Transparency and Substance, Action 5－2015 Final Report (Action 5 Final Report) published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), rulings are defined as:
“any advice, information or undertaking provided by a tax authority to a specific taxpayer or group of taxpayers concerning their tax situation and on which they are entitled to rely”.
# Types of rulings
2. person-specific rulings. Rulings can also be categorised as follows: The definition of rulings is wide and includes both general rulings and
# Specific rulings
(a) These rulings apply to a specific person and on which that person is entitled to rely. Such rulings can be given both pre- transaction and post-transaction to a ruling application by the person. Advance tax rulings, clearances and advance pricing arrangements (APAs) are included.
# in response
# Advance tax rulings
(b) These rulings are specific to an individual person and provide a determination of the tax consequences of a proposed transaction on which the particular person is entitled to rely. Advance tax rulings may come in a variety of forms and may include rulings or clearances that are given as part of a statutory process or an administrative practice, that are given informally. Such rulings are tailor-made for the person concerned as they take into account the factual situation of the person and are thus not directly applicable to other persons.
including rulings
# Advance pricing arrangements
(c) Ruling under this category is defined in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations as “an arrangement that determines, in advance of controlled transactions, an appropriate set of criteria … for the determination of the transfer pricing for those transactions over a fixed period of time.” These rulings provide certainty about how transfer pricing rules apply to future transactions within the scope of the APA. They normally do this by determining an appropriate set of criteria (e.g. method, comparables and appropriate adjustments thereto and critical assumptions as to future events) for the determination of the transfer pricing.
# General rulings
(d) These rulings apply to groups or types of persons or may be given in relation to a defined set of circumstances or activities, rather than applying to a specific person. They typically provide guidance on the position of the tax authority on such matters as the interpretation of law and administrative practice and on their application generally, to a specified group of persons or to specified activities. This guidance typically applies to all persons that engage in activities or undertake transactions that fall within the scope of the ruling.
# Compulsory spontaneous exchange of information
In the OECD framework for the compulsory spontaneous exchange of 3. information set out in the Action 5 Final Report, it is agreed that six categories of specific rulings which in the absence of compulsory spontaneous exchange of information could give rise to base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) concerns. These six categories are:
(a) rulings relating to preferential regimes;
# (b) unilateral APAs or other cross-border unilateral rulings in respect
# of transfer pricing;
2
(c)
cross-border rulings providing for a downward adjustment of taxable profits;
# (d) permanent establishment rulings;
(e)
# related party conduit rulings; and
(f)
any other type of ruling agreed by the Forum on Harmful Tax Practices (FHTP) that in the absence of spontaneous information exchange gives rise to BEPS concerns.
Hong Kong is a member of the Inclusive Framework on BEPS and has 4. committed to implement the minimum standards of the BEPS package, including the spontaneous exchange of tax rulings. The Commissioner does not give rulings falling within category (c) while the exact scope for category (f) has yet to be decided by FHTP. Therefore, the Competent Authority for Hong Kong would only be required to exchange rulings falling within categories (a), (b), (d) and (e).
# STATUTORY RULING SYSTEMS
# Advance rulings under section 88A
5. Under the advance ruling system, a person may apply to the Commissioner for a ruling on how a provision of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Ordinance) applies to the person or the arrangement specified in the application. Specifically, section 88A of the Ordinance provides that the Commissioner may, on an application made by a person in accordance with Part 1 of Schedule 10, make a ruling on any of the matters specified in that Part in accordance with that Part. is broadly a written confirmation of
6. the Commissioner’s view of the application of the Ordinance to a specific transaction or arrangement, for which the person applies can rely on in most circumstances. A fee which is calculated on the basis of cost recovery will be charged by the Commissioner for providing the advance ruling service.
3
# Advance pricing arrangement under section 50AAP
Upon application, the Commissioner may make an APA with a person 7. relating to how the person’s income or loss is to be computed under section 50AAF (arm’s length principle for provision between associated persons) or 50AAK (separate enterprises principle for attributing income or loss of non-Hong Kong resident person) for a fixed period of time. Details about APA are set out in Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes (DIPN) No. 48 Advance Pricing Arrangement.
# ADVANCE RULING SYSTEM
# Objectives of advance ruling system
8. The advance ruling system is designed to clarify the tax treatment of the arrangements contemplated. It does not in itself change that treatment: it simply explains what the treatment is likely to be, so that the person to whom the ruling applies can make informed decisions. The main objectives of the advance ruling service are to: provide the person who applies for a ruling with a degree of certainty about the tax treatments basing on the current tax legislation for seriously contemplated arrangements;
# (b) promote consistency in the application of the Ordinance; and
# (c) minimise disputes between the Commissioner and the person.
Seriously contemplated arrangement
9. arrangement but not one that is hypothetical or speculative. “arrangement”, as defined in section 2 of the Ordinance, includes:
An advance ruling will only be given for a seriously contemplated The term
(a)
any agreement, arrangement, understanding, promise or undertaking, whether express or implied, and whether or not enforceable or intended to be enforceable, by legal proceedings;
4
# and
# (b) any scheme, plan, proposal, action or course of action or course
# of conduct.
# Scope of advance rulings
10. Section 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 10 to the Ordinance provides generally that the Commissioner may make a ruling on how a provision of the Ordinance applies to the applicant or to the arrangement described in the application, whether or not reference is made to that provision in the application. The scope of the advance ruling service is wide. The matters for which ruling is sought include territorial source principle, preferential regime, general anti-avoidance provision, etc. Sections 1A, 2 and 3 of Part 1 of Schedule 10 set out the circumstances under which a ruling will/ may not be made. Generally speaking, the Commissioner will be accommodating to the applications for advance ruling unless they fall within the exceptions outlined in paragraphs 11 to 16 below. Subject matters not for ruling under Schedule 10
11. made on how a provision of the Ordinance applies if the provision relates to: Section 1A of Part 1 of Schedule 10 specifies that a ruling is not to be
(a)
# the imposition or remission of a penalty;
(b)
the correctness of a return or other information supplied by a person;
(c)
# the prosecution of a person;
(d)
# the recovery of a debt owing by a person; or
(e)
# the computation of income or loss under section 50AAF or 50AAK.
5
Grounds for not making a ruling
Ruling declined under Schedule 10
12. decline to make a ruling if:
Pursuant to section 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 10, the Commissioner may
(a)
the application seeking the Commissioner to determine or establish any question of fact. In this regard a ruling will not be available on matters that are a pure question of fact (e.g. whether or not the gain arising from the disposal of property is chargeable to tax);
# the
# ruling would
# require
(b)
the Commissioner considers that the correctness of the ruling would depend on the making of assumptions, whether in respect of a future event or any other matter;
(c)
the matter on which the ruling is sought is subject to an objection or appeal, whether in relation to the applicant or any other person (i.e. the matter on which a ruling is sought is the same in character as a completed transaction entered into by the applicant in an earlier year and the tax effect of that earlier transaction is the subject of discussion with the applicant or is subject to an objection or appeal, whether in relation to the applicant or any other person, or the central issue concerns a matter that is before a board, a tribunal or the courts or, if a judgment has been issued, an appeal is under consideration); or
(d)
the matter on which a ruling is sought is the subject of a return which has been or is due to be lodged.
Ruling refused under Schedule 10
13. make a ruling if:
Under section 3 of Part 1 of Schedule 10, the Commissioner shall not
(a)
the Commissioner considers that the arrangement in relation to which the ruling is sought is not seriously contemplated by the applicant;
6
(b)
the application is frivolous or vexatious;
(c)
the Commissioner is undertaking an audit on how any provision of the Ordinance applies to the applicant, or to an arrangement similar to the arrangement which is the subject of the application, during any period for which the proposed ruling would apply were the ruling to be made;
(d)
the Commissioner considers that the applicant has not provided sufficient information in relation to the application; or
(e)
the Commissioner considers that it would be unreasonable to make a ruling in view of the resources available to the Commissioner.
Ruling declined or refused under other circumstances
14. Despite not specifically stipulated in the provisions in Part 1 of Schedule 10, an application for a ruling would generally be declined in the following circumstances:
(a)
the ruling application contains alternative proposals or courses of action on the part of the applicant;
(b)
the matter is primarily one of fact and the circumstances are such that all the pertinent facts cannot be established at the time of the application for the ruling;
(c)
the ruling requires an opinion as to generally accepted accounting principles or commercial practices;
(d)
the matter is the law concerned with the administration of the tax system; or
(e)
the issue involves the interpretation of a foreign law.
The Commissioner may decline to make a ruling on a matter relating to 15. the exercise of a discretion under a provision of the Ordinance if, in the
7
circumstances of the applicant’s case, it would be more appropriate to exercise the discretionary power under that provision, or to inform the applicant that the discretionary power will not be exercised. Generally, applicants seeking the exercise of a discretionary power should request the exercise of that power rather than apply for an advance ruling on how that power might be exercised (e.g. in relation to a discretion to defer the time to enforce the payment of tax, the Commissioner may just decide to defer the time to enforce the tax payment rather than make an advance ruling).
16. It must also be stressed that the Commissioner will not help with tax planning, give advice as a purely academic exercise or allow any persons to meet their needs to the detriment of others and the robustness of the system as a whole.
Notification of declining or refusing to make ruling
17. In a case where an application for a ruling has been declined or a ruling is not made, the applicant will be notified in writing with the reasons therefor pursuant to section 4 of Part 1 of Schedule 10.
# APPLICATIONS FOR ADVANCE RULING
# Applications
18. Any person may apply for an advance ruling on the way in which a provision of the Ordinance applies to the person or to any particular arrangement which falls within the purview of the ruling system. The person is allowed to withdraw the ruling application in writing at any time before the ruling is made.
# Extent of disclosure
19. When seeking a ruling, all relevant information known to the applicant must be disclosed in the application. The applicant has to “put all his cards face upwards on the table” as explained in R v IRC ex parte MFK Underwriting Agencies Ltd & Others [1989] STC 873. The applicant is responsible for ensuring that the information provided is correct, accurate and complete. In R v IRC ex parte Matrix Securities Ltd [1994] STC 272, at the House of Lords it was held that the revocation of assurances was proper because the information 8
submitted by the company in respect of a proposed trust which was a tax avoidance scheme had been inaccurate and misleading.
20. Furthermore, it is not enough to merely disclose sufficient information so that appropriate inferences could be drawn. Apart from setting out all the relevant facts, the applicant is expected to draw the Commissioner’s attention to all the crucial issues and questions of the arrangement. The Commissioner should also be made aware of relevant materials, matters or sources of information so as to ensure access to all the pertinent facts and law. The Commissioner shall not make a ruling where the information is not sufficient or the disclosure is inadequate. Information and documents required
21. The checklist should be cross-referenced with the supporting documents where applicable. An application for a ruling should be made on a specified application form: “Application for Advance Ruling” (Form IR1297) together with supporting information and documents. What information and documents are required will depend on the circumstances of the ruling application. As explained in paragraph 22 below, the Commissioner may specify the information and documents. In any case, the application must contain the following: the name of the person that the ruling applies, address and tax file number and similar information in respect of all other parties to the arrangement (any information not on hand at the time of application should be supplied as soon as it is available);
A checklist for making a ruling application is attached at Appendix 1.
(b)
if the application is made by a representative of the person, written evidence showing that the representative is authorised to act for the person;
(c)
a cheque for the application fee and an undertaking to pay such further fees as may be payable in respect of the ruling application;
(d)
a statement as to whether any of the matters involved in the ruling application are, to the best of the person’s knowledge, being considered in connection with a tax return already filed or any of the matters are under objection or appeal;
9
(e)
an indication of the subject matter of the ruling application together with a complete description of all relevant facts and documents relating to the arrangement for which the ruling is sought and a complete description of each proposed transaction therein by setting out chronologically all transaction steps;
(f) with regard to each proposed transaction covered by the ruling

the applicant’s interpretation of the application of the provisions of the Ordinance that are relevant;
# (iii)
the reasons why the particular way or method of implementation has been adopted;
# (iv)
details of how the transaction will be accounted for where relevant to the tax consequences;
(v)
a description of the tax concern that is the cause of the application for ruling; and
# (vi)
statements or reasons and draft answers to the issues and questions identified to show clearly what ruling is being sought and why it is sought.
(g)
copies of any supporting documents, such as draft agreements or contracts, together with a summary of relevant facts contained therein;
(h)
the provision of the Ordinance in respect of which the ruling is sought;
(i)

(j)
the assumptions made by the applicant in respect of the arrangement;
10
(k)
the years of assessment or period to which the application relates;
(l) whether an application or similar application has been made about the arrangement for any other years of assessment or period;
(m) where appropriate, a complete description of significant transactions completed by the applicant prior to the time of submission of the ruling application or that may be undertaken after the completion of the arrangement, which may be part of a series of transactions;
(n) where the ruling application concerns the application of the general anti-avoidance rule (e.g. section 61A of the Ordinance) to the arrangement or any part thereof, submissions to establish that the arrangement or any part thereof would not directly or indirectly result in or amount to a misuse of the provisions of the Ordinance or an abuse having regard to the provisions of the Ordinance read as a whole;
(o) where relevant to the ruling application, an analysis of authorities known to the person or the representative which support the person’s position, and those that do not, with submissions why the authorities in support of the person’s position should prevail;
(p)

(q)
if spontaneous exchange of information is required (see paragraphs 3, 4, 62 to 64), the Appendix to Form IR1297; and
(r)
a draft ruling in the format as outlined at Appendix 2.
22. Under sections 8 and 9 of Part 1 of Schedule 10, the Commissioner may require the applicant to provide further information for the purposes of the application for a ruling. Section 8 stipulates that the Commissioner may specify in writing that further information be provided. In this regard, it is hereby specified that if a ruling relates to a matter which falls within another DIPN, the application should include, in addition to the items listed in paragraph 21 above, 11
any further information which is specified in the relevant DIPN. It is also hereby specified that where an application for a ruling is in relation to a matter of the kind listed below, additional information should be provided as detailed in the corresponding Appendix.
(a) On whether profits are to be treated as chargeable to profits tax under section 14 of the Ordinance as arising in or derived from Hong Kong for:
(i)
# trading profits from the purchase and sale of goods – Appendix 3
# (ii)
# profits from manufacturing of goods – Appendix 4
# (iii)
# commission income – Appendix 5
(b) On whether remuneration under certain arrangements is to be treated as chargeable to salaries tax under section 9A of the Ordinance – Appendix 6
(c) On whether the assessable profits are to be computed under section 21A as 30% or 100% of the sum deemed by section 15(1)(a), (b) or (ba) of the Ordinance – Appendix 7
# Quality and completeness of information
23. In addition to the hard copies, the applicant can provide a CD-ROM containing the proposed draft ruling and, where available, other relevant documents, including all draft agreements and the draft public offer document.
Where an incomplete application is submitted, the applicant will be 24. contacted and advised that the application is invalid and that work will not begin on it until the missing information has been provided. This ensures that applicants who do comply with all documentary and information requirements are not disadvantaged.
If the applicant cannot provide all the information required above, the 25. applicant may make a request to the Commissioner for waiver of any of the
12
requirements. An explanation of why the information cannot be furnished, together with any supporting evidence, must accompany the request.
Fees for ruling applications
The fees, including any reimbursement, payable in respect of an 26. application for a ruling are set out in Part 2 of Schedule 10 to the Ordinance and may, by notice published in the Gazette, be amended from time to time. Appendix 8 sets out details of those fees provided under the law as it stood at the date of this DIPN.
27. In particular, the applicant shall reimburse the Commissioner in relation to the ruling any fees incurred for external advice and any costs and reasonable disbursements.
28. Where an application for a ruling is withdrawn, the applicant is still liable to pay all the fees specified in Part 2 of Schedule 10 and incurred in respect of the application before the Commissioner receives notice of the withdrawal.
29. Pursuant to section 88A(5), any fees payable by an applicant for a ruling application may in exceptional cases be waived in whole or in part at the discretion of the Commissioner.
# Submission of ruling applications
30. Applicants are encouraged to submit an application early in the year of assessment to which the proposed ruling relates. This should ensure sufficient time to finalise the ruling.
31. should be forwarded to:
Applications for ruling, together with cheques for the application fee,
The Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Technical) 15/F, Inland Revenue Centre 5 Concorde Road, Kai Tak Kowloon, Hong Kong
Crossed cheques should be made payable to “The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region”.
13
# Processing of ruling applications
Ruling applications will normally be dealt with in the order in which 32. they are received. The Commissioner will, provided all relevant information is furnished with the application and further consultation with the applicant is unnecessary, endeavour to respond within six weeks of the date of receipt of the application. In case additional information is required, the six-week response period will count from the date when full information is received by the Commissioner. Obviously, an early submission of all information could speed up the processing. Whilst every effort will be made to deal with the applications for ruling as expeditiously as possible, there may be instances that the Commissioner will require additional time to fully consider an application (e.g. the arrangement involves complex issues). Applicants will be advised at the earliest possible time when any unusual delay is foreseen.
33. Any application for processing a ruling application ahead of its regular order will only be considered in exceptional circumstances. Such application should be made in writing to the Commissioner outlining the reasons for special consideration.
34. documents or an on-site inspection may be requested in appropriate circumstances. Depending on the merits, the Commissioner may permit an applicant to have a meeting to provide new information, to clarify the facts or to clear up any misunderstandings or information previously provided. The applicant may also be given an opportunity to consult the person to whom the ruling applies if the ruling the Commissioner proposes to issue differs from that applied.
Upon processing a ruling application, further relevant information and
35. All documentation provided by the applicant in support of the ruling application will be retained by the Commissioner, irrespective of whether a ruling is issued or the application is subsequently withdrawn.
36. The Commissioner is entitled to decline to make a ruling where the correctness of the ruling would depend on assumptions about future events or other matters, and that the Commissioner is not obligated to first request that information from the applicant in those circumstances: Commissioner of Taxation v Hacon Pty Ltd (2017) 106 ATR 863. If the Commissioner considers that the correctness of a ruling would depend on assumptions being made about a future 14
# event or any other matter, the Commissioner may:
(a) make any assumptions that are considered to be most appropriate
# under section 10 of Part 1 of Schedule 10; or
(b) decline to make the ruling under section 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 10.
37. not make assumptions about information which the applicant can provide. Pursuant to section 11 of Part 1 of Schedule 10, the Commissioner may
# EFFECTS OF A RULING
# Finality of ruling
38. applicant or not, is final. correspondence will be entertained and it will not be subject to objection or appeal. However, in the case of an unfavourable ruling, the applicant has the choice of not carrying out the proposed arrangement. If the proposed arrangement is effected, the ruling has to be complied with. A person’s right of objection against an assessment subsequently issued in accordance with the Commissioner’s unfavourable ruling is not affected. Applying ruling to the arrangement
A ruling made by the Commissioner, whether advantageous to the Once a ruling has been issued, no further
39.
The ruling made by the Commissioner will state:
(a)
the identity of the person, the provisions of the Ordinance and the arrangement to which the ruling applies;
(b)
# the period for which the ruling applies; and
(c)
any material assumptions about future events or other matters made by the Commissioner.
Generally, the period for which the ruling is valid will be the period to 40. which the particular arrangement relates. A ruling in respect of an arrangement
15
that is intended to apply to similar arrangements that are capable of application over an extended period of time will generally only be valid for the current year of assessment. In general, such a ruling will not be valid for more than two years of assessment from the year of issue of the ruling.
According to section 5 of Part 1 of Schedule 10, where the 41. Commissioner has made a ruling to a person on the application of any provision of the Ordinance in relation to an arrangement, and:
(a)
the ruling applies in relation to the arrangement during the whole or any part of the period specified in the ruling; and
(b)
the person has disclosed in the return provided under the Ordinance that the ruling has been relied on in preparing and providing the return,
the Commissioner shall apply the provision in relation to the person and the arrangement in respect of the whole of the period or the part of the period, as the case may be, in accordance with the ruling.
42. A ruling on a provision of the Ordinance only applies to a person in relation to an arrangement if the provision is expressly referred to in the ruling and only for the period specified in the ruling. It is important to note that each ruling is confined to its specific terms and it cannot be relied upon as a precedent for similar arrangements or for a future ruling application regardless of how similar the facts of that arrangement or application may be to the issued ruling. Applying ruling to a class of persons
43. Where appropriate, the Commissioner will issue a class ruling in response to an application seeking advice about the application of a relevant provision to a specific class of persons in relation to a particular arrangement. The purpose of a class ruling is to provide certainty to participants (e.g. employees participating in a share award scheme) and obviate the need for individual participants to seek rulings.
44. It contains the Commissioner’s opinion about the application of the relevant A class ruling describes the relevant details of a particular arrangement.
16
provisions to a specific class of persons in relation to the particular arrangement. The following are examples of situations where such a ruling may be given:
(a) an employer seeks ruling about the tax consequences of a
# redundancy plan for a class of employees;
(b)
an employer seeks ruling about the tax consequences of an employee share acquisition plan for a class of employees;
(c)
a company seeks ruling about the tax consequences for its shareholders as a result of a restructure of the company, a split or consolidation of its shares, or any other proposed transaction of the company affecting the tax affairs of its shareholders.
45. The Commissioner will apply a class ruling to all persons in the specific class concerned, although such persons might not be a party to, or might have not authorised, the application. Such treatment, however, does not affect the objection and appeal rights of those persons. The applicant should ensure that all concerned persons are informed of the application and the ruling made.
46. It has to be made explicitly clear that class rulings will not be issued in relation to “tax products” or “tax schemes” designed to obtain tax benefits for the participants, whether identified or not.
Not applying the ruling
47. A ruling is given subject to the condition that the arrangement will be implemented in the way stated in the application and the ruling. Section 7 of Part 1 of Schedule 10 states that a ruling shall not apply to a person in relation to an arrangement if:
(a)
the arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in the ruling;
(b)
there was a material omission or misrepresentation in, or in connection with, the application for the ruling; or
17
(c)
any assumption of the Commissioner about a future event or any other matter that is stated in the ruling is incorrect.
48. A ruling has no binding effect on the Commissioner if the arrangement entered into is materially different from the arrangement ruled upon: see Bellinz Pty Ltd v FCT (1998) 39 ATR 198. The word “material” is not defined in the Ordinance. For the purpose of ascertaining whether there is material difference, omission or misrepresentation, the Commissioner will look at the arrangement on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the individual circumstances of the person. A difference will be material if it results in a tax outcome being different to that set out in the ruling: see Carey v Field (2002) 51 ATR 40. Guidelines that are not rulings
The Commissioner may issue guidelines or pamphlets, including 49. DIPNs, setting out the Commissioner’s interpretations on certain provisions and the practices in relation to the law. These guidelines do not apply to a specific person or a class of persons and should not be regarded as rulings. If a representation made in the guidelines is so clear and unqualified, then a person may be entitled to rely on it: see Samarkand Film Partnership No 3 and others v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2017] STC 926.
The judgment in R (on the application of Aozora GMAC Investment Ltd) 50. v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2019] STC 2486 confirms that there will be circumstances in which the guidance issued by a tax authority can give rise to a legitimate expectation. However, it should be clear that the situations in which a person will be able to bring a successful claim for a breach of that legitimate expectation are not unlimited. In R (on the application of Hely-Hutchinson) v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2017] STC 2048, it was held that there had to be sufficient unfairness to support the claim of legitimate expectation. The unfairness had to reach a very high level and had to be outrageously or conspicuously unfair.

# MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES
# Disclosure
51. Where－
(a)
a person has obtained a ruling;
(b)
the person is required to provide a return; and
(c)
in preparing the return the person is required to take into account the way in which a provision of the Ordinance applies to the arrangement identified in the ruling, the person must disclose in the return:
(i)
# the existence of the ruling;
(ii) whether or not the person has relied on the ruling in
preparing and providing the return; and
# (iii)
any material changes to the arrangement identified in the ruling.
# Withdrawal of a ruling
Section 13 of Part 1 of Schedule 10 provides that the Commissioner 52. may at any time withdraw a ruling by notifying the person to whom the ruling applies in writing of the withdrawal and the reasons therefor.
53. If an arrangement is entered into or effected after the date of withdrawal of a ruling, the ruling shall cease to apply in relation to the arrangement. If the arrangement has been entered into or effected on or before the date of the withdrawal:
(a) where a person to whom the ruling applies has disclosed in the return provided under the Ordinance that the person has relied on the ruling in preparing and providing the return, the ruling shall, after the date of the withdrawal, continue to apply in relation to
19
the arrangement for the remainder of the period specified in the ruling;
(b)
in any other case, the ruling shall cease to apply in relation to the arrangement.
# Impact of legislative amendment on rulings
Section 16(a) of Part 1 of Schedule 10 provides that if any provision of 54. the Ordinance that is the subject of or affects a ruling is repealed, the ruling ceases to apply to the extent of, and from the effective date of, that repeal.
