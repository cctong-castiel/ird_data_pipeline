# SCHEDULE
# Inland Revenue Ordinance (Chapter 112)
# SPECIFIED SECURITIES FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTION 15E
I, WONG Ho-sang, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, pursuant to section 15E of the Inland Revenue Ordinance as amended by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 4) Ordinance 1996, hereby specify that where associated parties are not involved (see paragraph 2 below), securities falling into the following categories are specified securities for the purposes of section 15E -
(i)
any debt or equity security listed on a stock exchange in Hong Kong or any other stock exchange or over-the-counter market the for recognized Commissioner;
# the purposes of
# this paragraph by
(ii) 	 any unlisted debt issued to third parties or guaranteed to third parties by listed companies (including affiliates owned 50% or more by listed companies);
# (iii)
this purpose, 	any unlisted sovereign debt (including, for government agency debt, multilateral agency debt and debt guaranteed by multilateral agencies or sovereign governments); and
(iv) 	 any unlisted debt or equity securities issued pursuant to a private placement authorized by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission or a similar supervisory body in another jurisdiction.
Subject to paragraph 4, associated parties are considered to be 2. involved if under what would otherwise be a stock borrowing and lending agreement the borrower is an associate of the lender or it is intended by any of the parties concerned that, either directly or indirectly, any or all of the securities borrowed under the agreement are to be on-lent to an associate of the lender. For the purpose of ascertaining whether a person is an associate of the lender, regard will be had to the definition of "associate", and related definitions, in section 21A of the Ordinance.
2 -
3. If the lender or borrower under the agreement, or any subsequent borrower (i.e. if the securities are to be on-lent) is a trustee of a trust estate or a corporation controlled by such a trustee, the definition of “associate” will be applied on the basis that the lender or borrower, as the case may be, is each of the trustee, the corporation and the beneficiary under the trust (as defined in section 21A).
4. For the purposes of this Schedule, associated parties are deemed not to be involved where it would otherwise be the case if the parties to a stock borrowing and lending agreement are securities dealing and underwriting firms, which are regulated by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission or a similar supervisory body in another jurisdiction, or affiliates owned 50% or more, directly or indirectly, by such firms. It should be noted in relation to any such case that section 15E only applies where the parties concerned deal with each other on an arm’s length basis and the lender does not enter into the stock borrowing and lending agreement with the purpose, or main purpose, of avoiding or deferring tax (see section 15E(1)(d) and (e)). For agreements involving associated parties, application may be 5. made on a “particular case” basis to the Commissioner to have the subject securities declared to be “specified securities”. In such a case, it will be necessary to establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the agreement is in essence a bona fide stock borrowing and lending agreement entered into on an arm’s length basis and not having as a main purpose the obtaining of a tax benefit.
