## INTRODUCTION

The territorial concept has always been fundamental to the taxation of profits in Hong Kong.  Only those profits which arise in or are derived from Hong Kong are liable to tax here.  However, where the territorial concept is clear,  its  application  in  particular  cases  at  times  remains  a  contentious  issue between  the  Department  and  practitioners  with  numerous  disputes  being referred  to  the  Board  of  Review  and  the  Courts.    The  decisions  of  the  Privy Council  in CIR  v.  Hang  Seng  Bank  Limited  [1991]  1  AC  306 , HK-TVB International  Limited  v.  CIR [1992]  2  AC  397 and CIR v.  Orion  Caribbean Limited [1997] HKLRD 924 and of the Court of Final Appeal in Kwong Mile Services  Limited  v.  CIR [2004]  3  HKLRD  168 , Kim  Eng  Securitie s (Hong Kong) Limited v. CIR [2007] 2 HKLRD 117 and ING Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Limited v. CIR [2008] 1 HKLRD 412 , established guidelines to assist in locating the source of profits.  The broad guiding principle is that 'one looks to see what the taxpayer has done to earn the profits in question and where he has done it'.

2. The Hang  Seng  Bank , HK-TVBI , Orion  Caribbean , Kwong  Mile , Kim Eng and ING Baring decisions do not set out rules to cover all cases where the locality of profits in issue, rather they clarify the general principles to be followed in determining the locality of profits.  The purpose of this note is to state what the Department considers are the general principles laid down by the Privy Council and the Court of Final Appeal and then give specific examples applying those principles.  At the same time, it must be emphasised that each case  will  be  determined  on  its  own  facts.    As  commented  on  in Orion Caribbean , Hang Seng Bank did not, when speaking of 'profits earned 'by the exploitation of property assets by letting property, lending money or dealing in commodities or securities' lay down a rule of law.  Rather, the case affirmed that 'no simple legal test can be employed'.

## BASIC TESTS FOR LIABILITY TO PROFITS TAX

3. Section  14  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  ('the  Ordinance') makes  it  clear  that  only  profits  arising  in  or  derived  from  Hong  Kong  are chargeable to profits tax.  The residence of a taxpayer is not relevant.  In Hang

Seng Bank ,  Lord Bridge explained the three conditions that must be satisfied before a profits tax liability arises:

- (a) The person must carry on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong;
- (b) The profits to be charged must be from such trade, profession or business carried on by the person in Hong Kong; and
- (c) The profits must be profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong.

This Practice Note will focus on the third condition, i.e. the locality of profits. The  terms  'source'  and  'locality'  are  used  interchangeably  in  this  Practice Note.

## SOURCE CONCEPT

4. Though the word 'source' is not used in section 14, it has always been accepted by the courts that the words 'arising in or derived from' raised the  concept  of  source.    Cases  from  other  common  law  jurisdictions  with legislation  using  the  specific  word  'source'  are  therefore  relevant  and  have been used in assisting the interpretation of  the  words  used  in  section  14.    In CIR v.  Philips  Gloeilampenfabrieken [1955] NZLR 868 ,  Barrowclough  CJ  at 874 said that the concept of derivation seems necessarily to imply the concept of a source.
5. 'Source' is not a legal concept.  In Nathan v. FCT [ 1918] 25 CLR 183 at 189-190, Isaacs J explained:

'The  Legislature  in  using  the  word  'source'  meant,  not  a  legal concept,  but  something  which  a  practical  man  would  regard  as  a real source of income.  Legal concepts must, of course, enter into the question when we have to consider to whom a given source belongs. But  the  ascertainment  of  the  actual  source  of  a  given  income  is  a practical, hard matter of fact.'

## THE BROAD GUIDING PRINCIPLE

6. Lord Bridge in Hang Seng Bank has  the  following to say at 319A about the distinction of profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong and those that are not:
2. ' … a distinction must fall to be made between profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong ('Hong Kong profits') and profits arising in or derived from a place outside Hong Kong ('offshore profits') according  to  the  nature  of  the  different  transactions  by  which  the profits are generated .'
7. Lord Bridge explained the 'broad guiding principle' in Hang Seng Bank at 322H to 323A in the following terms:
4. 'But the question whether the gross profit resulting from a particular transaction arose in or derived from one place or another is  always  in  the  last  analysis  a  question  of  fact  depending  on  the nature of the transaction. It is impossible to lay down precise rules of law by which the answer to that question is to be determined. The broad  guiding  principle,  attested  by  many  authorities,  is  that  one looks  to  see  what  the  taxpayer  has  done  to  earn  the  profit  in question.'
8. The 'operations test' was further elaborated by Lord Jauncey in HKTVBI at 407C-D:
6. 'F. L. Smidth &amp; Co. v. Greenwood [1921] 3 K.B. 583 was cited in Hang Seng Bank case and their Lordships do not doubt that Lord Bridge has in mind the judgment of Atkin L. J. in that case and in particular  the  passage  when  he  said,  at  p.  593:  'I  think  that  the question  is,  where  do  the  operations  take  place  from  which  the profits in substance arise?'

Thus Lord Bridge's guiding principle could properly be expanded to read 'one looks to see what the taxpayer has done to earn the profit in question and where he has done it . '

9. Lord Bridge exemplified his dicta in paragraph 7 above at 323A-B as follows:
2. 'If he has rendered a service or engaged in an activity such as the manufacture of goods, the profit will have arisen or derived from the place where the service was rendered or the profit making activity carried  on.    But  if  the  profit  was  earned  by  the  exploitation  of property assets as by letting property, lending money or dealing in commodities or securities by buying and selling at a profit, the profit will have arisen in or derived from the place where the property was let, the money was lent or the contracts of purchase and sale were effected.'
10. The  examples  cited  by  Lord  Bridge  in Hang  Seng  Bank are  not meant to be exhaustive and a careful analysis of the relevant facts need to be carried  out  in  deciding  whether  a  particular  case  falls  within  the  examples. Lord  Jauncey  in HK-TVBI has  warned  against  such  an  approach  in  the following terms at 409D-E:
4. ' Their  Lordships  consider  that  it  is  a  mistake  to  try  and  find  an analogy between the facts in this appeal and the example given by Lord Bridge in the Hang Seng Bank case.  The circumstances in that case  involving,  as  they  did,  buying  and  selling  in  well  defined foreign markets were very different from those in the present and the examples were never intended to be exhaustive of all situations  in which section 14 of the Ordinance might have to be considered.  The proper  approach  is  to  ascertain  what  were  the  operations  which produced  the  relevant  profits  and  where  those  operations  took place. '
11. The broad guiding principle has been followed in subsequent cases before the Court of Final Appeal.  In Kwong Mile , Bokhary PJ summarised the broad guiding principle at 174I to175E:

'The  ascertainment  of  the  source  of  a  profit  is  not  hindered  by technical rules, but is helped by the broad guiding principle that one looks to see what the taxpayer has done to earn the profit and where he has done it. …….  In CIR v. Orion Caribbean Ltd [1997] HKLRD

924, Lord Nolan emphasised (at p.931F) that ' [n]o simple, single, legal  test  can  be  employed'  when  ascertaining  the  source  of  a profit. …...  The situations in which the source of a profit has to be ascertained  are  too  many  and  varied  for  a  universal  judge-made test.      Apart  from  the  words  of  the  statute  themselves,  the  only constant is the need to grasp the reality of each case, focusing on effective causes without being distracted by antecedent or incidental matters.'

12. While the question of source of profits is a practical, hard matter of fact,  the  broad  guiding  principle  formulated  in  the  judicial  precedents  has enabled the proper and consistent application of the source concept to various factual  situations.    The  broad  guiding  principle  is  not  a  set  of  rules.    A  rule attaches  a  definite,  detailed  consequence  to  a  detailed  set  of  facts.    It  either applies to a given situation, or it does not so apply; there is no latitude in its application.    A  principle,  relative  to  a  rule,  is  broad,  general  and  unspecific. The broad guiding principle is an authoritative starting point for assessing and reassessing, inclining towards a particular decision but not necessarily compelling it.
13. The  broad  guiding  principle  is  not  exhausted  by  any  catalogue  of factual  circumstances.    It  does  not  expire  when  no  judicial  decision  clearly covers the present case because the value of the principle relies on the relevant operations which produce the profits.  It improves certainty even if a taxpayer finds that some of the details of his specific case are different.  He would know how to apply the profits tax charging provisions as he would understand the underlying  principle.    By  elucidating  the  broad  guiding  principle  underlying the taxation of profits, conceptual clarity and a more coherent regime can be achieved.

## ANTECEDENT OR INCIDENTAL ACTIVITIES

14. In ING Baring at 428, Ribeiro PJ when discussing the legal principle also emphasised the need to grasp the reality of each case, focusing on effective causes without being distracted by antecedent or incidental matters.  The focus is on establishing the geographical location of the taxpayer's profit-producing

transactions as distinct from  activities antecedent  or incidental to those transactions.

15. Whether an act is an antecedent or incidental activity is a question of fact and would depend on the nature of the transaction.  In CIR v. The Hong Kong &amp; Whampoa Dock Co Ltd [1960] 1 HKTC 85 , the initial business contact in Hong Kong which set in motion a chain of operations that ultimately led to the salvaging of the vessel was rejected as the relevant operation.
16. Comments  in  a  similar  vein  can  be  found  in Hang  Seng  Bank at 320F-G:
3. ' The  activities  of  the  bank  from  which  the  income  arose  was  the buying  and  selling  of  this  property  in  overseas  market  places  and not  the  decision  making  process  in  Hong  Kong  or  any  other activities  in  Hong  Kong.    Likewise  the  income  arose  from  the trading  in  property  situate  outside  of  Hong  Kong  and  not  the moneys of customers situate in Hong Kong. '

## PRINCIPLES ON WHICH LOCALITY OF PROFITS IS DETERMINED

17. Assuming the first  two  conditions  stated  in  paragraph  3  above  are satisfied, liability to profits tax will only arise if a person's profits arise in or are  derived  from  Hong  Kong.    The  Department's  view  is  that  the  basic principles for determining the locality of profits enunciated in the decisions of Hang Seng Bank , HK-TVBI , Orion Caribbean , Kwong Mile , Kim Eng and ING Baring can be summarised as follows:
2. (a) The  question  of  locality  of  profits  is  a  hard,  practical matter  of  fact.    No  universal  judge-made  test  will  cover every case.  Whether profits arise in or are derived from Hong Kong depends on the nature of the profits and the transactions giving rise to them.
3. (b) The  ascertainment  of  the  source  of  profits  though  a practical,  hard  matter  of  fact  requires  an  accurate  legal analysis of the transaction.

- (c) The  transactions  must  be  looked  at  separately  and  the profits of each transaction considered on their own.
- (d) The broad guiding principle is that one looks to see what the taxpayer has done to earn the profits in question and where he has done it.  In other words, the proper approach is  to  ascertain  what  were  the  operations  which  produced the relevant profits and where those operations took place.
- (e) The operations in question must be the operations of the taxpayer.
- (f) The relevant operations do not comprise the whole of the taxpayer's  activities carried out in the course  of his business  but  only  those  which  produce  the  profit  in question.  It is necessary to appreciate the reality of each case,  focusing  on  effective  causes  for  earning  the  profits without being distracted by antecedent or incidental matters.
- (g) The distinction between Hong Kong profits and offshore profits is made by reference to gross profits arising from individual transactions.
- (h) In certain situations, where gross profits from an individual transaction arise in different places, they can be apportioned  as  arising  partly  in  and  partly  outside  Hong Kong.
- (i) The place where day to day investment decisions are taken does not generally determine the locality of profits.
- (j) It  is  necessary  to  examine  the  operations  of  the  taxpayer irrespective of the fact that the taxpayer may  be  a company within a group.  The source of profits must be attributed to the operations of the taxpayer which produce them  and  not  to  the  operations  of  other  members  of  the group.  The operations of the group should not be looked

at  on  the  question  of  source.    However,  in  appropriate cases,  if  a  related  company  is  in  fact  acting  on  behalf  of the  taxpayer,  then  the  activities  of  the  related  company will be considered to see if appropriate weight should be accorded thereto.

- (k) If  an  arrangement  or  scheme  is  implemented  in  Hong Kong  to  free  transactions  from  overseas  regulations  or overcome trade barriers, this in itself does not mean that the profits will be sourced outside Hong Kong.
- (l) Identifying  an  agent's  acts  with  those  of  its  principal, whilst  imposing  some  unity  on  the  law  applicable  to situations  where one party represents or acts for another, should not be taken to an inappropriate degree or taken too literally  since  this  is  not  conducive  to  arriving  at  the accurate legal analysis.
- (m) In brokerage business, it is not necessary that the transaction which produced the profit was carried out by the  taxpayer  or  his  agent  in  the  full  legal  sense  (i.e.  one who  enters  into a contract on his principal's behalf creating  a  contractual  relationship  between  his  principal and a third party).  It is sufficient that the transaction was carried out on the taxpayer's behalf and for his account by a person acting on his instructions.
- (n) The absence of an overseas permanent establishment of a Hong Kong business does not, of itself, mean that all of the  profits  of  that  business  arise  in  or  are  derived  from Hong Kong.
- (o) The place where the taxpayer's profits arise is not necessarily the place where he carries on business. However, in HK-TVBI Lord Jauncey said, 'it can only be in  rare  cases  that  a  taxpayer  with  a  principal  place  of business  in  Hong  Kong  can  earn  profits  which  are  not chargeable to profits tax.'

The above summary only serves to outline the important principles and does not mean to be exhaustive.  It goes without saying that the peculiar facts of a case may call for special consideration.

The following paragraphs set out the Department's views on how the source of  profits  is  to  be  determined  with  respect  to  various  forms  of  business activities.

## TRADING PROFITS

18. In CIR  v.  Magna  Industrial  Co  Ltd [1997]  HKLRD  171 at  178, Litton VP recognised that in case of a trading profit the purchase and the sale were the important factors.  He further included in his deliberation all of the relevant operations and not just the purchase and sale of the products.   When applying the operations test, Litton VP said at 176G:
2. 'In  other  words,  one  looks  to  see  what  the  taxpayer  has  done  to earn the profits and where he has done it.  Obviously the question where the goods were bought and sold is important.  But there are other  questions:  For  example:  How  were  the  goods  procured  and stored?    How  were  the  sales  solicited?    How  were  the  orders processed?  How were the goods shipped?  How was the financing arranged?  How was payment effected?'
19. The obtaining of the buyer's order in Hong Kong and the placing of the  order  with  the  seller  from  Hong  Kong  are  the  foundations  of  a  trading transaction since the differential between the selling price and the buying price (i.e. the mark-up) generates the profit.  In Exxon Chemical International Supply SA v. CIR 3 HKTC 57 , having decided that the obtaining of the order from the buyer and the placing of the order with the seller, took place respectively in and from Hong Kong, Godfrey J concluded that the profit arose in or was derived from Hong Kong.
20. In CIR  v.  Euro  Tech  (Far  East)  Limited 4  HKTC  30 ,  Barnett  J doubted that there should be some particular level or threshold of activity on the part of the taxpayer in Hong Kong, such as by bringing the products into Hong  Kong  and  re-exporting  them.    He  observed  that  in  many  trading

companies  the  taxpayer  was  doing  no  more  than  bringing  together  the complementary needs of sellers and buyers.  He said if the bringing together was done in Hong Kong the trading profit was sourced in Hong Kong.

21. When Lord Bridge said in Hang Seng Bank that profits from buying and reselling of commodities were derived from the place where 'the contracts of purchase and sale were effected', he could not merely mean legally executed (as  this  would  depend  on  formal  legal  rules  of  offer  and  acceptance).    The Department agrees with the approach in Magna and  will  contemplate  all  the relevant operations carried out to earn the profits, including the solicitation of orders, negotiation, conclusion, trade financing, shipment and performance of the contracts.
22. The  Department  does  not  merely  look  at  the  place  of  contract  to determine the geographical source of profits.  Where the contract is made by exchange of letters, by fax, or by e-mail, the application of contract law and of private  international  law  as  to  where  the  contract  is  made  may  result  in conclusions that are entirely fortuitous.   In Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd v.  Lewellin [1957]  1  WLR  464  (HL) at  471,  Lord  Radcliffe  said  such  an approach under the conditions of international business and modern facilities of communication was capable of proving a somewhat ingenuous one.  Hunter J shared the same view in Sinolink Overseas Ltd v. CIR 2 HKTC 126 at 131.
23. On the basis of the various court judgments discussed in paragraphs 18  to  22  above,  the  Department's  views  which  are  reflected  in  its  assessing practice on the locality of profits derived from trading in commodities or goods by a business carried on in Hong Kong can be summarised as follows:
4. (a) Where both the contract of purchase and contract of sale are effected in Hong Kong, the profits are fully taxable.
5. (b) Where both the contract of purchase and contract of sale are effected outside Hong Kong, no part of the profits are taxable.
6. (c)      Where  either  the  contract  of  purchase  or  contract  of  sale  is effected  in  Hong  Kong,  the  initial  presumption  will  be  that the profits are fully taxable. Matters, such as those

mentioned  in  paragraph  18  above,  will  be  examined  to determine the issue.

- (d) Where the sale is made to a Hong Kong customer (including the  Hong Kong buying office of an overseas customer), the sale contract will usually be taken as having been effected in Hong Kong.
- (e) Where the commodities or goods are purchased from either a Hong Kong supplier or  manufacturer,  the  purchase  contract will usually be taken as having been effected in Hong Kong.
- (f) Where the effecting of the purchase and sale contracts does not  require  travel  outside  Hong  Kong  but  is  carried  out  in Hong  Kong  by  telephone,  fax,  etc.,  the  contracts  will  be considered as having been effected in Hong Kong.
- (g) The purchase and sale contracts are important factors but all the relevant operations that produce the trading profits must be looked at to determine the locality of the profits.

Persons  who  are  merely  trading  with  Hong  Kong  by  either  selling  goods  to customers in Hong Kong or buying goods from suppliers in Hong Kong will not fall within the ambit of this paragraph.  Nor will this paragraph applies to a buying office referred to in paragraph 29 below.

24. Having regard to the points expressed above, it will be apparent that, in the  Department's  view,  the  question  of  apportionment  does  not  arise  in relation  to  trading  profits.    Trading profits  will  be  either  wholly  taxable  or wholly non-taxable.  There is no room to substitute a mixed source for a Hong Kong source even though there might be some overseas activities.
25. Cases may arise where it is claimed that contracts of purchase and of sale have been effected wholly outside Hong Kong by employees of the Hong Kong  business  travelling  abroad  or  by  overseas  agents.    In  this  context,  no operations  are  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong  to  give  effect  to  the  trading transaction; and the employee or overseas agent habitually exercises a general authority to negotiate and conclude contracts on behalf of his principal.

26. Normally the activities of an agent and an employee are accorded the same weight if it can be shown that the employee has full authority to conclude contracts  without  reference  to  the  business  in  Hong  Kong.    In  considering claims  that  contracts  have  been  wholly  effected  outside  Hong  Kong  by employees, Assessors will, in addition to facts in paragraph 18 above, require details of travelling, hotel and  subsistence  expenses  in  respect  of  each individual  transaction.    Where  it  is  claimed  that  contracts  are  effected  by overseas  agents,  it  will  be  necessary  to  provide  agency  agreements  or  other evidence to support the claim.

## RE-INVOICING CENTRE

27. The  Department's  view  is  that  if  a  profit  is  derived  from  services rendered in Hong Kong, the profit is clearly taxable.  Commission income or profit that accrues to a 're-invoicing centre' for services rendered is chargeable to  profits  tax.    Profits  derived  from  the  buying  and  selling  of  goods  are  not service income.  The transaction involves the taking of commercial risks (e.g. product  risks,  inventory  risks,  credit  risks,  exchange  risks,  capital  risks,  etc.) different from those attached to a service.  Confirmation of sales and issue of purchase orders are indications that it is a trading transaction.  The source of trading profits depends on the locality of the trading operations.  Paragraphs 18 to 26 are relevant.
28. It is not possible to categorise the circumstances under which income or  profit  derived  by  a  're-invoicing  centre'  would  be  regarded  as  a  service income  and  not  as  a  trading  profit.    In  each  case,  the  Department  would examine  the  nature  of  the  operations  and  the  type  of  risks  in  question  to determine  whether  they  constitute  the  provision  of  services  or  trading.    The label 're-invoicing centre' clearly does not in itself provide the answer as it can mean different business structures.

## Example 1

Company A, incorporated in Hong Kong, is a re-invoicing centre of a group of companies with a holding company incorporated in the United States, as more particularly described below.  It manages in Hong  Kong  all  foreign  currency  exposures  from  intra-company trade, guarantees the exchange rates for future orders and manages intra-affiliate  cash  flows,  including  lead  and  lags  of  payments. Manufacturing affiliates in Mainland China sell goods to Company A,  which  in  turns  resells  to  the  distribution  affiliates  in  North America and Europe. Company A resells at cost plus a mark-up for its services.   The mark-up covers the cost of the re-invoicing centre and a reasonable return on the services provided.

The profits accrue to Company A are service income derived from Hong Kong.  The mark-up earned by Company A, which acts as a re-invoicing centre, is chargeable to profits tax.

## BUYING OFFICE

29. A trading company, carrying on business outside Hong Kong, may set  up  a  branch  in  Hong  Kong  to  act  as  a  buying  office  for  the  purpose  of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information.  The activities of  the  branch  are  confined  to  the  purchase  of  goods  or  merchandise  or  of collecting information in Hong Kong and it is not involved in their sale, either in  Hong  Kong  or  elsewhere.    In  such  a  situation,  a  liability  to  Hong  Kong profits  tax  would  not  arise.    The  functions  of  a  buying  office  may  also  be carried  out  by  a  subsidiary  company  or  by  an  agent  (either  related  or unrelated).  However, as for a branch, the subsidiary company or agent must not be involved in the sale of the goods.  On the other hand, any commission or other remuneration earned by the subsidiary company or agent for performing its services in Hong Kong will be fully taxable.

## MANUFACTURING PROFITS

30. Lord Jauncey in HK-TVBI at 410F has commented on the source of manufacturing profits.  He explained:
2. 'If a manufacturer in Hong Kong sells his goods to a merchant in Manila the payment which he receives is no doubt sourced in Manila but  his  profit  on  the  transaction  arises  in  and  is  derived  from  his manufacturing operation in Hong Kong.'

Where goods are manufactured in Hong Kong, the profits arising from the sale of  such  goods  will  be  fully  taxable  because  the  profit  making  activities  are considered  to  be  the  manufacturing  operations  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong, which  should  include  the  procurement  of  raw  materials,  the  employment  of labour, the design of products and the use of machinery and plant, etc.

31. The  following  examples  illustrate  the  Department's  views  on  this subject:

## Example 2

Company  B  manufactures  goods  in  Hong  Kong  and  sells  them  to overseas customers.  The fact that Company B has sales staff based overseas does not give a part of the profits an overseas source.

This is not a case for apportionment.  The whole of the profits are liable to profits tax.

## Example 3

Company C manufactures in Mainland China and sells the finished goods  through  a  retailing  branch  in  Hong  Kong.    The  retailing branch  has  sales  staff  and  a  fixed  place  of  business,  and  has registered for business in Hong Kong.

Company C is both a manufacturer and a retailer.  Profits are derived from  the  manufacturing  operations  in  Mainland  China  and  the retailing operations in Hong Kong.  It is necessary to apportion the

profits  derived  by  Company  C.    Profits  attributable  to  the  Hong Kong retailing branch are chargeable to profits tax.

32. In Mainland China, two types of processing trade normally involve Hong Kong companies: contract processing and import processing.  They are two different forms of transaction and require an accurate legal analysis.

## CONTRACT PROCESSING

33. In  contract  processing,  the  document  that  governs  the  contractual relationship  among  the  parties  is  the  processing  agreement.    It  sets  out  the rights  and  responsibilities  of  the  Hong  Kong  company  and  the  Mainland processing enterprise.  The Hong Kong company is responsible for the supply of raw materials and machinery without consideration and to provide technical and managerial know-how  while  the  Mainland  processing enterprise is responsible for the provision of factory premises, utilities and labour force.
34. In return for the processing service, the Hong Kong company pays a subcontracting  charge  to  the  Mainland  enterprise.    The  legal  title  to  the  raw materials and finished goods remains with the Hong Kong company.  In the Department's view, the Hong Kong company's operations in Mainland China complement its operations in Hong Kong.  Recognising the operations of the Hong Kong company in the Mainland, an apportionment of profits on a 50:50 basis is usually accepted.
35. In D132/99 15  IRBRD  25 ,  the  taxpayer  contended  that  all  of  its profits were offshore in nature.  The Board of Review held that its operations in  Mainland  China  were  not  dominant  operations  that  overshadowed  the activities  in  Hong  Kong  and  the  operations  in  Hong  Kong  could  not  be disregarded.
36. In D145/99 15 IRBRD 91 , the Board found that the taxpayer was not privy to the processing agreements, which had been entered into by its fellow subsidiaries and the taxpayer should be assessed for profits tax on 100% of its profits for the years of assessment after the processing agreement lapsed.  The Board found that the taxpayer's business was the procurement of toys to satisfy sale  and  purchase  contracts  and  that  important  operations  took  place  inside

Hong Kong: the reaching of purchase agreements; the determination of price; the  issue  of  invoices;  the  procurement  of  raw  materials  and  the  shipment  of finished products.

37. If  the  Hong  Kong  company  has  restricted  involvement  in  the processing  arrangement  with  the  Mainland  enterprise,  the  apportionment  of profits  could  not  be  appropriate.    For  example,  a  Hong  Kong  company  has contracted out the assembly work to various contractors in Hong Kong and the Mainland.  The jobs are numerous, small in value and of short duration and the Hong Kong company has minimal involvement in the assembly work.  Given that the Hong Kong company does not carry out any manufacturing operations outside Hong Kong, its profits should be fully chargeable to profits tax without any apportionment.
38. The  apportionment  contemplated  in  paragraph  34  above  will  also apply to cases where manufacturing activities are undertaken under a similar arrangement in other places.

## IMPORT PROCESSING

39. In import processing, the manufacturing operations are carried out by a foreign investment enterprise (FIE) related to the Hong Kong company.  An FIE is often a separate legal entity incorporated in the Mainland.  The Hong Kong company sells raw materials to the FIE and buys back the finished goods from  the  FIE.    The  Hong  Kong  company  engages  in  the  trading  of  raw materials and finished goods whilst the FIE manufactures the finished goods. The legal title to the raw materials and the finished goods passes to/from the FIE.
40. In import processing, the gross profits arise from trading transactions whereby the Hong Kong company purchases finished goods from an FIE and sells  them  for  a  profit.    The  manufacturing  operations  of  the  FIE  in  the Mainland are not performed on behalf of, or for the account of, the Hong Kong company even though the Hong Kong company and the Mainland enterprise might be within the same group of companies.

41. In ING Baring , Lord Millet NPJ said that the source of profits had to be attributed to the operations of the taxpayer which produced them and not to the  operations  of  other  members  of  the  group.      In D36/06 21  IRBRD  694 which was a typical import processing case, the Board held that the taxpayer's profits were fully chargeable to profits tax.   It was ruled that the FIE was not part  of  the  taxpayer  and  was  not  an  agent  of  the  taxpayer.    Hence  the  FIE's operations  were  not  relevant  in  determining  the  source  of  profits  of  the taxpayer.    The  Board  of  Review  rejected  the  contention  of  'substance  over form' and disagreed with the suggestion that a leasing agreement of production facilities was similar to a contract processing agreement.
42. The  Department  holds  the  view  that  profits  which  accrued  to  the Hong Kong company from 'trading transactions'  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong cannot  be  attributed  to  the  manufacturing  operations  of  the  FIE  carrying  on business  in  Mainland  China.    The  source  of  the  trading  profits  must  be attributed to the operations of the Hong Kong company which produced them. In Consco Trading Co. Ltd v. CIR [2004] 2 HKLRD 818 , To Deputy J said that it was correct to consider factors such as the finance arrangements, the payment of raw materials and processing fees, the arrangement for receipt of payment from purchasers for the finished product and pre-contract negotiations and the Board was entitled to conclude that, on the evidence, the preponderance of the activities which earned the profits were performed in Hong Kong.  The Court of  First  Instance  said  the  Board  correctly  excluded  the  processing  activity  of the  Mainland  Chinese  entity  as  not  being  relevant  to  the  determining  of  the taxpayer's source of profits which were derived through the sale of processed goods.
43. In CIR  v.  Datatronic  Limited [2009]  4  HKLRD  675 ,  where  the arrangement  between  Datatronic  and  the  FIE  was  an  import  processing arrangement,  the  Court  of  Appeal  held  that  the  profit-producing  transactions were the purchase of goods from the FIE by Datatronic and subsequent sale and  that  these  activities  took  place  in  Hong  Kong.    Thus,  the  profits  were derived from Hong Kong.  The Court of Appeal further held that the fact that the FIE, although a wholly-owned subsidiary of Datatronic, is a separate legal entity and that its dealings with Datatronic were not at arm's length would not detract from the reality of the legal effect of the transactions.  It is also worth to note  the  Court  of  Appeal's  concurrence  with  the  Board's  findings  that  the manufacturing was done by the FIE in the Mainland is substance and not form and that Datatronic's activities (i.e. assisting the FIE in preparing the goods and

supplying  them  to  Datatronic)  in  the  Mainland  were  merely  antecedent  or incidental to the profit-generating activities.

44. The Department has noticed that a Hong  Kong  company  is sometimes interposed between an overseas company and a Mainland manufacturing  enterprise  in  order  to  comply  with  or  circumvent  the  trade barriers  imposed  by  the  overseas  jurisdiction.    In D7/08 23 IRBRD 102 ,  the Board of Review recognised that making the Hong Kong company a customer of  the  overseas  company  and  of  the  Mainland  enterprise  freed  the  overseas company from the trade barriers.    Applying  what  the  Court  of  Final  Appeal held in the Kim Eng case on the effective cause of the production of the profits in  question,  it  was  held  that  the  Hong  Kong  company's  relevant  activity  in Hong Kong however limited was what was done to earn the profits in question and the Hong Kong company did it in Hong Kong.

## OTHER PROFITS

45. Subject to specific provisions, the Department regards the locality of the following types of profits to be as follows:

| Income or Profits   | Income or Profits                                                                | Locality                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| (a)                 | Rental income from real property.                                                | Location of the property.                                                                                                 |
| (b)                 | Profits derived by an owner from the sale of real estate.                        | Location of the property.                                                                                                 |
| (c)                 | Profits from the purchase and sale of listed shares and other listed securities. | Location of the stock exchange where the shares or securities in question are traded.                                     |
|                     |                                                                                  | Where the purchase and sale took place over-the-counter, the place where the contracts of purchase and sale are effected. |

| (d)   | Profits from the purchase and sale of unlisted shares and other unlisted securities.   | Place where the contracts of purchase and sale are effected, except financial institutions in instances where section 15(1)(l) applies.        |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| (e)   | Service fee income.                                                                    | Place where the services are performed which give rise to the fees.                                                                            |
| (f)   | Interest earned by persons other than financial institutions.                          | Determined on the basis set out in DIPN No. 13 ('Profits tax - Taxation of Interest Received').                                                |
| (g)   | Royalties other than those deemed chargeable under section 15 (1) (a), (b) or (ba).    | Place of acquisition and granting of the licence or right of use. Please refer to Departmental Interpretation & Practice Notes No. 49, Part B. |

- (h) Cross-border land transportation income.

Normally the place of uplift of the passengers or goods. However,  where  the  contract of carriage does not distinguish  between  outward and inward transportation, apportionment will not be permitted.

Article 8 of the Comprehensive Double Taxation Arrangement with the Mainland is relevant.  See relevant  paragraphs  in  DIPN No. 44 ('Arrangement between the Mainland of China and the  Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region for  the  Avoidance  of  Double Taxation  and  the  Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income').

## APPORTIONMENT OF PROFITS

46. The  Department  accepts  that,  notwithstanding  the  absence  of  a specific provision for apportionment of profits in the Inland Revenue Ordinance,  there  are  certain  situations  in  which  an  apportionment  of  the chargeable  profits  is  appropriate.    The  example  of  manufacturing  profits  has already been explained above.  A further example is service fee income where the  services  are  performed  partly  in  Hong  Kong  and  partly  outside.    On  the other hand, as has been mentioned in paragraph 24 above, the Department does not find an apportionment of trading profits is required.
47. In  contract  processing  cases,  a  50:50  basis  of  apportionment  is applied  as  the  norm,  in  view  of  the  contractual  conditions  imposed  on  the parties to the arrangement. For other cases where apportionment is

appropriate,  the  basis  applied  will  depend  on  the  facts  of  the  case;  the Department  will  consider  any  rational  basis  put  forward  by  the  taxpayer concerned.  In calculating the portion of the profits derived from Hong Kong, it will  be  necessary  to  scale  down  claims  for  general  expenses  of  the  business which contribute indirectly to earning both the Hong Kong and offshore profits from the transactions in question.  General expenses in this context refer to all indirect expenses.  In the tax computation, the taxpayer should explain clearly the basis upon which such expenses have been scaled down.  In most cases, it will  be  appropriate  to  apportion  by  reference  to  gross  profits  rather  than  to assets. Requests to re-open previous years assessments to permit apportionment  will  not  be  entertained  (section  70A  -  prevailing  practice). Below examples explain why there should not be an apportionment of profits.

## Example 4

Company D purchases goods from suppliers in Hong Kong.  It pays a  marketing  company  in  Hong  Kong  to  arrange  the  placement  of advertisements in newspapers and magazines, which are circulated in  London  and  Paris.    On  receiving  orders,  Company  D  ships  the goods to the overseas customers and collects payment though credit card companies .

Although the goods are advertised overseas, this does not alter the fact  that  everything  that  Company  D  itself  does  is  done  in  Hong Kong. The  profits derived by Company  D  should  be  fully chargeable and no apportionment is required.

## Example 5

Company E is a manufacturer in Hong Kong.  It manufactures goods in Hong Kong and sells them to the overseas customers.  Every year, Company E and the customers sign master sale agreements outside Hong Kong.

The master sale agreements are not determinant for the purpose of determining the source of trading profits.  They might be important for business purpose for they settle many particulars of the terms of trade, yet they do  not constitute the  manufacturing  or  selling

operations of Company E.  The taking of orders by Company E, the manufacture  of  the  goods  and  the  appropriation  of  the  stock  in response to the orders, and the shipment of the goods are the relevant operations  that  generate  the  profits  of  Company  E.    The  profits accrued to Company E should not be apportioned.

## SALE OR PURCHASE COMMISSION

48. This refers to situations where commission income is earned both by securing buyers for a manufacturer's products and by securing manufacturers to make products required by customers.  Typically the commission income is a percentage of the invoiced value of the goods.   In such cases the Department considers  that  the  activity  which  gives  rise  to  the  commission  income  is  the arrangement of the business to be transacted between principals.   The source of  the  income  is  the  place  where  the  activities  of  the  commission  agent  are performed.
49. The place where the principals are located, how they are identified by the commission  agent  and  the  place where  incidental activities are performed  prior  to  or  subsequent  to  the  earning  of  the  commission  are  not generally relevant.   However, if substantial business activities are performed in Hong Kong for and on behalf of a principal incorporated overseas, in particular in  a  no  or  low  tax  jurisdiction,  the  Department  will  examine  the  case  more thoroughly to determine whether the principal has any profits tax liability under section 14.
50. Commission income may also arise where a business is carried on in Hong  Kong  but  the  activities  which  give  rise  to  the  commission  are  not  in Hong Kong.   In such cases, the commission is not taxable.  Typical of these situations are the following examples -

## Example 6 - Sales or purchase agencies

Company F holds the 'Far East Area' sales or purchase responsibility for a product or group of products sold into the area or  sourced in the area by principals who are associated concerns. Company F and the associates are members of a group under the

control of a common parent organisation.  Company F is appointed agent for the area, either by formally executed agreements or by a directive  from  the  parent  organisation  and  is  remunerated  by  a 'commission' on all sales and/or purchases in its area.  Company F may either -

- (a) actively solicit orders ex-Hong Kong, on behalf of its principals  by  sending  employee  representatives  overseas  for the purpose or by employing sub-agents overseas; or
- (b) factually do nothing whatsoever, either itself or through subagents.

## Example 7 - Passive commission

A similar organisational set-up to the agencies in Example 6 above, but in this case Company G is given sales or purchase responsibility for group products in the 'Far  East Area'  as a principal. Factually, Company G is unable to handle all or any of the group range  of  products  and  sales  into  or  purchases  from  the  area  are therefore entirely made by associated concerns.  It is never intended that  Company  G  will  perform  any  purchasing  or  sales  function. Company  G  receives  an  'infringement  commission'  for  which  it does nothing (except possibly the rendering of some 'sales service' ex-Hong Kong).

Alternatively, it may be the case that Company G sells or buys group products in Hong Kong (profits thereon may, in accordance with the principles  stated  under  the  heading  of  Trading  Profits,  subject  to Hong Kong profits tax) and in addition receives 'commissions' on sales or purchases by associated concerns in the 'Far East Area'. These commissions are paid in pursuance of a parent organisation directive.    Company  G  has  no  formal  function  or  contractual position in relation to the associates' transactions in the 'Far East Area', i.e. it has no 'area responsibility' either as principal, agent or  sales  representative  and  renders  no  service  in  respect  of  the commission it receives.

## GROUP SERVICE COMPANIES

51. This refers to cases where a Hong Kong company, usually a member of  a  multinational  group,  renders  support  services,  such  as  marketing  and training,  to  group  members  located  throughout  the  Asia-Pacific  region.    The services  are  rendered  substantially  in  Hong  Kong.    Inter-group  charges  are made  at  an  agreed  mark-up  of  cost  (typically  5%  to  10%)  and  represent  an arm's length reward for the services provided plus a recoupment of 100% of the costs incurred by the Hong Kong company.
52. The profits, being the mark-up, derived by the Hong Kong company for its services are regarded by the Department as wholly assessable.  However, in  some  cases  the  inter-group  charges  have  been  grossed  up  to  reflect  the imposition of a withholding tax on the service charges by the country in which the group  entity  receiving  the  services  is resident. In these cases  the Department will allow the Hong Kong company to deduct, from the service fee charged,  the  foreign  withholding  tax  paid.    The  effect  is  to  assess  the  Hong Kong  company  on  the  net  (of  withholding  tax)  service  fee  received.    This reflects  the  principle  set  out  in  DIPN  No.  28  ('Profits  Tax  -  Deductibility  of Foreign Taxes') concerning the deductibility of foreign taxes that are charged on earnings, regardless of whether or not a profit is made.

## FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

53. In  1986  the  Department  reached  agreement  with  practitioners  and their financial institution clients on the taxation treatment of certain interest and related  fee  income.    This  recognised  the  practical  difficulties  associated  with determining the assessable profits of such institutions and provided them with added  certainty  in  their  taxation  affairs.    The  agreement  reduced  the  large number of disputes which had arisen following the 1978 amendment to section 15(1)(i) of the Inland Revenue Ordinance.
54. Following the decisions in the Hang  Seng Bank and Orion Caribbean, questions arose about certain aspects of this practice.  However, in the  interest  of  maintaining  certainty  the  Department  is  prepared  to  continue with this agreed treatment, details of which are set out below.

## Types of Income

## 1. Interest from loans

- (a) Offshore loans initiated, negotiated, approved and documented by an associated party outside Hong Kong and funded  outside  Hong  Kong,  i.e.  funds raised and loaned direct to the borrower by a non-resident, e.g. head office, branch, or subsidiary, etc. albeit through or in  the  name  of  the  Hong  Kong institution.

100% Non taxable

- (b) Offshore loans initiated, etc. by the Hong Kong institution and funded by it in/from Hong Kong.

100% Taxable

- (c) Offshore loans initiated, etc. by an associated party outside Hong Kong but funded by the Hong Kong institution.

50% Taxable

- (d) Offshore loans initiated, etc. by a Hong Kong institution but funded by offshore associates.    It  is  considered  that  this category only applies to start-up positions where the Hong Kong institution  has  yet  to  establish  a  market presence.

50% Taxable

## Note on 'Funding'

For claims concerning loans funded by offshore associates, two essential requirements will have to be satisfied, namely -

- (i) that  the  Hong  Kong  institution  does not have the authority to seek its own source of funds in respect of the loans; and
- (ii) there must be documentary evidence to show  that  funds  have  been  directly provided by an offshore associate even though such funds  may  have  been routed through another vehicle in Hong Kong.  In other words, arbitrary funding  by  another  group  vehicle  in Hong Kong will not satisfy this requirement.

## Note on 'Initiation'

'Initiation'  refers  to  the  efforts  exerted  in obtaining  the  particular  business  including solicitation,  negotiation  and  structuring  of the  loans.    The  financial  institution  must  be able to substantiate that the mandate  or invitation  to  participate  was  secured  as  a direct result of the activities of an associated party  outside  Hong  Kong  for  an  offshore claim to succeed.

## 2. Interest on Certificates of Deposit (CDs)

Acquisition  of  CDs  will  be  treated  in  a similar  fashion  to  deposit  placements.    This treatment  is  predicated  on  the  fact  that  the Hong Kong institution operates within previously  approved  parameters  as  to  credit limits  and  prime  banks  with  whom  it  may operate.  In other words, there is an obvious distinction  to  be  drawn  between  CDs  and loans.

100% Taxable

## 3. Interest from securities other than CDs

A  similar  approach  to  be  adopted  as  for interest  from  loans.    If  there  is  to  be  any attribution of interest to offshore intervention,  the  role  of  the  Hong  Kong institution must be that of a mere intermediary  in  the  purchase  and  sale  of securities with no discretion in the matter.  It is unlikely that any claim for exemption will be  entertained  in  instances  where  the  Hong Kong  institution  possesses  its  own  security dealing capability and is active in this capacity.

See (1) above

## 4. Participation, Commitment, etc. fees

To  follow  the  tax  treatment  accorded  to See (1) above related loans.

## 5. Active fee

To be determined by reference to the 'Activity  Test',  i.e.  services  performed  to earn the fee.

## 6. Guarantee/underwriting fees

A principal consideration of source is related to whether or not the risk under the guarantee  or  underwriting  commitment  is evaluated  and  is  to  be  borne  by  the  Hong Kong  institution.    In  instances  where  the Hong Kong institution  has  no  discretion  on the acceptance or rejection of offshore instructions,  and  undertakes  no  risk,  such fees will be accepted as merely 'booked' and not assessable.

Depends  on  the particular facts of the case

## PROCESSING OF OFFSHORE CLAIMS

55. Not all the operations of a taxpayer are relevant in determining the source of a profit.  The process of identification of the source of profits may differ  depending  on  the  nature  of  transaction  in  question  and  the  context  in which the transaction takes place.  In Kim Eng Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd v. CIR [2007] 2 HKLRD 117 at 143C, Bokhary PJ said :
2. 'I am unable to accept the Taxpayer's argument that the Taxpayer's presence and activities in Hong Kong go only to the existence and operation of a Hong Kong business.  If the Taxpayer disputed the existence and operation of a Hong Kong business - which it does not - then its presence and activities in Hong Kong would probably be conclusive  against  it  on  such  an  issue.    Of  course  the  Taxpayer's presence  and  activities  in  Hong  Kong  are  far  from  conclusive against it on the question of source.  But that does not render such presence and activities wholly irrelevant to that question.'
56. Taxpayers should be ready to prove in their returns, with supporting documentary  evidence,  that  a  profit  from  a  transaction  was  derived  outside Hong Kong.  The Assessor has a statutory obligation to raise assessment and to make  enquiry.    In  this  process,  the  Assessor  has  been  given  power  under section 51(4) to seek for full information in regard to any matter which may affect  any  liability,  responsibility  or  obligation  of  any  person.    A  request  for detailed  information  about  the  'operations'  of  a  transaction  in  an  enquiry would constitute a reasonable demand as the public interests so require.  It has to be emphasised that the information seeking power entrusted to the Assessor under section 51(4) has not been restricted or reduced in any way after ING Baring .      In  most  cases,  the  reasons  why  the  Assessor  asks  for  a  piece  of information should be apparent.
57. The  Department  holds  the  view  that  the  final  step  of  the  profit generating process should not necessarily be considered as determinative of the locality  of  the  source  of  profits.    In  the  High  Court  of  Australia,  in COT  v. Hillsdon  Watts  Ltd 57  CLR  36 ,  Latham  CJ  said  that  income  received  by  a person  might  be  the  result  of  a  whole  series  of  operations  conducted  in different  countries.    In COT  v.  Kirk [1900]  AC  588 ,  when  delivering  the judgment of the Privy Council, Lord Davey said that the fallacy of the lower

courts was to leave out of sight the initial stages and fastening their attention exclusively on the final stage in the production of the income.

## AGENCY

58. In ING Baring ,  when discussing the business of stockbrokers, Lord Millet NPJ said that it was not necessary to establish that the transaction which produced the profit was carried out by the taxpayer or his agent in the full legal sense.  It was sufficient if it was carried out on his behalf and for his account by a person acting on his instructions.
59. The Department is of the view that the act of any person carried out overseas should not be readily attributed to a taxpayer in Hong Kong.  In ING Baring , Lord Millet NPJ referred to the provision of service and the earning of a commission by completing share transactions in an overseas market.  Indeed, Lord Millet NPJ agreed with Barma J and firmly rejected the proposition that 'commercial reality' dictated that the source of the profits of one member of a group of companies could be ascribed to the activities of another.

## BOOKED PROFITS

60. As  previously  indicated,  the  existence  of  a  business  carried  on  in Hong  Kong  in  not  decisive  of  a  source  of  profits  subject  to  profits  tax. However, it will 'only be in rare cases that a taxpayer with a principal place of business in Hong Kong can earn profits which are not chargeable to profits tax under  s.  14'  (see HK-TVBI ).    The  performance  in  Hong  Kong  of  activities which do not of themselves give rise to the profits, such as the rental of office premises,  recruitment  of  general  staff, etc., also do  not,  in  themselves, determine the locality of profits.  Where, however, commissions, fees, profits on sales, etc., relate to sales to, or services rendered to, Hong Kong customers, the  resultant  profits  will  generally  continue  to  be  liable  to  profits  tax.    The Department takes a serious view of schemes and devices which seek to 'book' Hong  Kong  profits  offshore.    It  will  not  hesitate  to  apply  the  general  antiavoidance provisions in such instances and, where  appropriate,  impose penalties in blatant cases involving the non-disclosure of relevant facts.  The opportunity is taken to remind taxpayers and their authorised representatives of

the need to accurately complete the return concerning transactions for or with non-residents.

## ADVANCE RULINGS

61. To provide certainty in this area, the Department has been providing advance rulings on the locality of profits to businesses.  This service is subject to  the  payment  of  a  fee.    Further  details  are  contained  in  DIPN  No.  31 ('Advance Rulings').

## CONCLUSION

62. It  is  considered that an update of the DIPN, particularly as regards trading profits, might be helpful.  It is hoped that this revised DIPN will further reduce  the  possibility  of  and  the  areas  of  dispute  between  taxpayers  and  the Department.  It should be reiterated  that  the  examples  outlined  in  this  DIPN represent simple, and straightforward situations and should be viewed accordingly.  As stated at the outset, each case needs to be considered in the light of its own particular circumstances and facts.  There is no simple legal test that can be employed in all cases.
