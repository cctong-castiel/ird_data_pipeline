## INTRODUCTION

## Ship leasing arrangement

Ship leasing is an arrangement under which a lessor leases a ship to a lessee  for  use  during  an  agreed  period  in  return  for  regular  lease  payments. Leasing  includes  finance  lease,  operating  lease,  sale  and  leaseback,  hirepurchase  and  conditional  sale  (retention  of  title).    Two  common  types  of arrangement  are:  operating  lease;  and  finance  lease. Depending  on  the operational needs (e.g. liquidity requirements), a lessee may choose to enter into an operating lease or a finance lease.    Operating lease allows a lessee to use a ship on a short term basis without financing its purchase price.    Finance lease is the main method of lease used to finance the acquisition of a ship.

2. In the ship leasing industry, a corporation is often used as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to hold a ship.    Incidental activities, including evaluation of  ship  investment,  fund  raising,  procurement  of  ship,  soliciting  lessees,  are carried out by a ship leasing manager remunerated by a ship lessor.    Sub-lease arrangements (e.g. a ship is leased to a ship operator through an intermediate lessor) and sale and leaseback arrangements (e.g. a lessee buys a ship, sells it to a lessor and then leases it back again for a period) are also structured.    Below diagram illustrates the relationships between the lessor, the leasing manager, the intermediate lessor and the lessee:

## Hong Kong's competitive advantage

3. In  April  2015,  the  Mainland  and  Hong  Kong  signed  the  Fourth Protocol to the Double Taxation Arrangement between the Mainland of China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region which reduced the withholding tax rate under the Royalties Article to 5% on lease rentals paid to a ship leasing business.    This has provided a solid foundation for ship lessors to domicile their leasing operations in Hong Kong.

## The Ship Leasing Amendment Ordinance

4. In June 2020, the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (Ship Leasing Tax Concessions) Ordinance 2020 (the Ship Leasing Amendment Ordinance) was enacted to provide tax concessions for ship leasing and ship leasing management businesses.    The purpose of this Note is to set out in detail the Department's views  and  practice  on  the  tax  concessions  for  qualifying  ship  lessors  and qualifying ship leasing managers.
5. The  Ship  Leasing  Amendment  Ordinance  amended  the  Inland Revenue Ordinance (the Ordinance) to give profits tax concessions to qualifying ship lessors and qualifying ship leasing managers and to make provisions for profits  tax  purposes  about  businesses  in  connection  with  ships.    The  main provisions are as follows:

Profits tax concessions for ship leasing and ship leasing management

- (a) Section 14O provides for the interpretation of terms used in the provisions for the profits tax concessions, including the definitions  of  qualifying  ship  leasing  activity  and  qualifying ship leasing management activity.
- (b) Section  14P  provides  for  the  profits  tax  concessions  for qualifying ship lessors:
- (i) Section  14P(1)  provides  that  a  corporation  that  is  a qualifying ship lessor for a year of assessment is entitled to  have  its  profits  derived  from  its  qualifying  ship leasing activity for that year of assessment charged at a

- concessionary tax rate specified in Schedule 8C.
- (ii) Section 14P(2) and (4) provides for how a corporation may  be  a  qualifying  ship  lessor  and  how  it  can  be entitled to the concessionary tax rate.
- (c) Section 14Q provides for certain tax treatments in connection with allowance for capital expenditure on ship.
- (d) Sections 14R and 14S provide for the calculation of tax bases:
- (i) Section 14R provides that if the profits tax concession under section 14P applies to a corporation for a year of assessment, the net lease payments for operating leases derived from its qualifying ship leasing activity are to be calculated  in  accordance  with  the  formula  set  out  in section 14R(2) or (3).
- (ii) Section 14S provides that if the profits tax concession under section 14P applies to a corporation for a year of assessment,  the  net  payments  of  finance  charges  or interest  in  relation  to  funding  leases  derived  from  its qualifying ship leasing activity are to be calculated in accordance with the formula set out in section 14S(2).
- (e) Section  14T  provides  for  the  profits  tax  concessions  for qualifying ship leasing managers:
- (i) Section  14T(1)  provides  that  a  corporation  that  is  a qualifying ship leasing manager for a year of assessment is entitled to have its profits derived from its qualifying ship  leasing  management  activity  for  that year  of assessment charged  at  a  concessionary  tax  rate.    The concessionary tax rate is one-half of the profits tax rate specified in Schedule 8 if the activity is not carried out for  an  associated  corporation,  or  the  profits  tax  rate specified in Schedule 8C if it is.

- (ii) Section 14T(2) provides for how a corporation may be a qualifying ship leasing manager, namely:
-  by  satisfying  the  conditions  specified  in  section 14T(3);
-  by  satisfying  the  safe  harbour  rule  under  section 14U; or
-  by obtaining the determination of the Commissioner under section 14V(1).
- (iii) Section 14T(5) provides for certain conditions for the entitlement to the concessionary tax rates.
- (f) Section  14U  provides  for  how  a  corporation  may  satisfy  the safe harbour rule.    There are two alternative safe harbours:
- (i) The 'one-year safe harbour' in section 14U(2) requires the corporation to satisfy certain conditions regarding its ship leasing management  profits and ship leasing management assets for the year of assessment concerned.
- (ii) The  'multiple-year  safe  harbour'  in  section  14U(3) requires the corporation to satisfy similar conditions for the year of assessment concerned and the preceding one or two years of assessment.
- (g) Section 14V provides for the Commissioner's discretion to make a  determination  that  a  corporation,  which  is  not  otherwise qualified, is a qualifying ship leasing manager.
- (h) Section 14W provides that, for the purposes of sections 14P(4) and  14T(5),  certain  threshold  requirements  under  Schedule 17FA must be met in order for a ship leasing activity or a ship leasing management activity to be considered to be carried out, or arranged to be carried out, in Hong Kong.

- (i) Section 14X sets out the circumstances under which the losses sustained by a corporation are not available for set off against its assessable profits.
- (j) Sections  14Y,  14Z  and  14ZA  contain  certain  provisions  for preventing avoidance of profits tax by means of the profits tax concessions.
- (k) Section 14ZB empowers the Commissioner to amend, by order published in the Gazette, Schedule 17FA.
- (l) Schedule 17FA defines ship leasing activity and ship leasing management  activity,  specifies  the  prescribed  percentages relating to the calculation of net lease payments and the safe harbour rule, and prescribes the threshold requirements for the purposes of section 14W.

## Gains or profits arising through or from ship business

- (m) Section 15(1)(o) and (1E) deems sums received by or accrued to a corporation from  carrying  on  certain businesses  in connection with ships as having a Hong Kong source, even if the ships are used outside Hong Kong.

## Anti-tax arbitrage provision

- (n) Section 16(1A) as amended prevents tax arbitrage through ship leasing transactions between connected persons.

## Finance charges or interest in relation to funding leases

- (o) Section 15G provides that receipts of finance charges or interest by  a  person  in  relation  to  a  funding  lease  in  the  course  of business are to be regarded as sums received by or accrued to the person by way of interest on money lent by the person.

- (p) Section 16(3D) provides that payments of finance charges or interest  by  a  person  in  relation  to  a  funding  lease  in  the production of profits are to be regarded as sums payable by way of interest on money borrowed by the person for the purpose of producing the profits.

## Notional depreciation allowances

- (q) Sections 37, 38, 39B  and 39D  as amended  deal with computation of the cost and capital expenditure in relation to a ship that is used by a corporation for carrying out a qualifying ship  leasing  activity  before  being  used  in  another  trade, profession or business.

## QUALIFYING SHIP LESSOR

## Profits tax concession for qualifying ship lessor

6. While  section  14P  contains  the  specific  provisions  relating  to  the profits  tax  concession  for  qualifying  ship  lessors,  the  charging  provisions  in section  14  for  profits  tax  continue  to  be  applicable.    Thus,  a  qualifying  ship lessor is chargeable to profits tax under section 14 since it is carrying on a ship leasing business in Hong Kong.
7. By virtue  of  section  14P(1),  a  corporation  that  is  a  qualifying  ship lessor is entitled to have its qualifying profits charged at a concessionary profits tax rate specified in Schedule 8C (i.e. 0% for the year of assessment commencing on  or  after  1  April  2020). The  qualifying  profits  would  include  income incidental to profits from a ship leasing business, like interest income, exchange gains or hedging gains, as long as the transactions are ancillary to the qualifying activities. Section  14P(4)  stipulates  that  the  tax  concession  applies  to  a corporation for a year of assessment only if:
3. (a) during the basis period for that year of assessment -

- (i) the central management and control of the corporation is  exercised  in  Hong  Kong  ( the  central  management and control requirement );
- (ii) the activities that produce its qualifying profits for that year are carried out in Hong Kong by the corporation; or arranged by the corporation to be carried out in Hong Kong ( the substantial activities requirement ); and
- (iii) those  activities  are  not  carried  out  by  a  permanent establishment  outside  Hong  Kong  ( the  attribution  to Hong Kong requirement ); and
- (b) the  corporation  has  made  an  election  in  writing,  which  is irrevocable, that the tax concession applies to it.
8. 'Ship lessor' is defined in section 14O(1) as a person carrying on a business of carrying out ship leasing activities.    Under section 14P(2), a ship lessor is a qualifying ship lessor for a  year of assessment if, during the basis period for that year of assessment:
- (a) it is not a ship operator;
- (b) it  has carried out in Hong Kong one or more qualifying ship leasing activities; and
- (c) it has not carried out in Hong Kong any activity other than a qualifying ship leasing activity.
9. A ship operator is not eligible to be a qualifying ship lessor.    'Ship operator' is defined in section 14O(1) as a person carrying on a ship operation business which means:
- (a) a  business  of  operating  ships  as  an  owner  or  a  charterer  for providing  services  for  the  carriage  by  ships  of  passengers, cargo or mail; but

- (b) does  not  include  dealing  in  ships  or  agency  business  in connection with sea transport.

In effect, ship operators are excluded from this preferential tax regime.

10. A qualifying ship lessor eligible for the profits tax concession must be a  standalone corporation engaging solely in qualifying ship leasing activities. This standalone condition is consistent with the industry practice of using SPVs to hold ships for leasing.    For the purpose of determining whether a ship lessor has  carried  out  any  activity  other  than  a  qualifying  ship  leasing  activity,  only activities that generate income to the ship lessor are to be taken into account as explained  in  section  14P(3). That  means  expense  transactions  would  be excluded.    For example, taking a lease in respect of the business premises for carrying out qualifying ship leasing activities or engaging a consultancy company for  assessing  market  condition  would  not  preclude  a  ship  lessor  from  being  a qualifying ship lessor since the ship lessor would only incur rental expenses or consultancy fee expenses in these transactions which do not generate income.

## Irrevocable election

11. Before the profits tax concession applies, a qualifying ship lessor has to  make  an  election  in  writing  (e.g.  in  a  tax  return)  as  required  by  section 14P(4)(b).    Once made, section 14P(5) makes the election irrevocable.    Thus, a  qualifying  ship  lessor  does  not  need  to  make  an  election  for  every  year  of assessment in which it is entitled to the tax concession.
12. If section 14P(1) no longer applies to a qualifying ship lessor, section 14P(6) provides that the election previously made by it ceases to be effective. In  case  the  qualifying  ship  lessor  is  entitled  to  the  tax  concession  again,  it  is required to make a fresh election.

## SHIP LEASING ACTIVITY

## Definition of ship

13. Under section 14O(1), 'ship' is defined as a vessel of any description capable of navigating in water and includes:

- (a) a barge or lighter;
- (b) an air-cushion vehicle (e.g. a hovercraft); and
- (c) a  dynamically supported craft as defined by section 2 of the Shipping and Port Control Ordinance (Cap. 313) (e.g. hydrofoil);

## but does not include -

- (a) a  junk  as  defined  by  section  2  of  the  Merchant  Shipping Ordinance (Cap. 281);
- (b) a vessel propelled by oars; or
- (c) a vessel solely for military use.

Thus, a seaborne unit not capable of navigating in water (e.g. drilling rig) is not included.

## Definition of ship leasing activity

14. Section  1(1)  of  Schedule  17FA  defines  'ship  leasing  activity',  in relation to a person, as an activity comprising:
2. (a) the leasing of a ship by the person to a ship lessor, ship leasing manager or ship operator; and
3. (b) any of the following activities carried out by the person -
4. (i) agreeing funding terms in relation to the lease concerned;
5. (ii) identifying or acquiring the ship to be so leased;
6. (iii) setting the terms and duration of that lease;
7. (iv) monitoring or revising any funding or other agreements in relation to that lease;

- (v) managing any risks associated with that lease or with an activity mentioned in subparagraph (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv).
15. Apart from leasing a ship directly to a ship operator, a ship lessor can lease a ship to an intermediate ship lessor or a ship leasing manager.    The ship operator, intermediate ship lessor or ship leasing manager may be carrying on business outside Hong Kong.    Thus, ship leasing activity does not cover the leasing of a ship to a person other than a ship lessor, ship leasing manager or ship operator.    Given that 'ship lessor' in section 14O(1) means a person carrying on  a  business  of  carrying  out  ship  leasing  activities,  the  term  'ship  leasing activity' in section 1(1) of Schedule 17FA also covers the ship leasing activities of a person (e.g. the intermediate ship lessor) who may not be a qualifying ship lessor or may be carrying on business outside Hong Kong.

## Meaning of lease

## Lease as a generic term

16. Section 14O(1) provides that the word 'lease', when used as a noun, means an operating lease or a funding lease.    When the word is used as a verb, it is to be construed accordingly.    Though the tax concession in section 14P(1) covers both operating lease and funding lease, calculations of their tax bases are different.
17. While generic definitions for operating lease and funding lease are provided in section 14O(1), no particular commercial requirements have been prescribed thereunder.    In other words, the ship lessor and ship lessee are free to decide the terms of the lease (e.g. crew is provided under the lease).    However, the person benefiting from the tax concession in section 14P(1) cannot be a ship operator whose profits are assessed in accordance with the provisions in section 23B.

## Operating lease

18. 'Operating lease', as defined in section 14O(1), means:

- (a) an arrangement under which a right to use a ship is granted by an owner of the ship to another person for a term exceeding one year ( specified head lease ); or
- (b) an arrangement under which a right to use a ship is granted by a lessee under a specified head lease (or by a sub-lessee or any other  person  deriving  the  right  under  the  lessee)  to  another person; and
- (c) does not include a funding lease.

An operating lease covers both a head lease (i.e. the ship is leased by an owner of  the  ship  to  another  person)  and  a  sub-lease  (i.e.  the  ship  is  leased  by  an intermediate ship lessor to another person).    While the term of a head lease has to exceed one year, there is no such requirement if the lease is a sub-lease.

19. An  operating lease, unlike a funding lease, does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a ship to the lessee.    The lessee under an operating lease pays the lessor lease payments in order to obtain the right to use the leased ship over an agreed fixed term.

## Example 1

Head Lessor-HK leased a ship to Intermediate Lessor-HK for a term of two years under a head lease.    Head Lessor-HK and Intermediate Lessor-HK  were  resident  in  Hong  Kong.    While  the  head  lease remained in force, Intermediate Lessor-HK sub-leased the ship to Ship Operator-F, resident in Jurisdiction-F, for a term of six months under a sub-lease.

Since the term of the head lease exceeded one year, the head lease would be regarded as an operating lease if it was not a funding lease. The sub-lease would also be regarded as an operating lease though its lease term was less than one year.

If the head lease was terminated in less than one year because of the occurrence of a force majeure event, the head lease would still qualify as an operating lease.    In deciding whether it is an operating lease or not,  the  provision  of  crew  or  other  facilities  might  not  be  of  much relevance.

## Funding lease

20. 'Funding lease", as defined in section 14O(1), means an arrangement:
2. (a) under which a right to use a ship is granted by a lessor to a lessee for a term exceeding one year;
3. (b) that satisfies one of the following conditions at its inception -
4. (i) the arrangement is accounted for as a finance lease or loan by the lessor in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants or the International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  issued  by the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board,  as  in force from time to time;
5. (ii) the  present  value  of  the  aggregate  minimum  lease payments (whether  or  not  they  are  periodic  payments and including any sum payable under a residual value guarantee) during the term of the arrangement is equal to or more than 80% of the fair market value of the ship;
6. (iii) the term of the arrangement is equal to or more than 65% of the remaining useful economic life of the ship; and
7. (c) under which the property in the ship will or may pass to the lessee, or an associate of the lessee, at the end of its term,

and includes an agreement or another arrangement in connection with such an arrangement.

21. In a funding lease, all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a ship are substantially transferred to the lessee and the property in the ship would pass to the lessee at the end of the lease term.    The ship lessor, often a finance company, buys a ship  from  the  shipbuilder  and  leases  it  to  the  lessee.    The lessee pays the lessor lease payments equivalent to the substantial fair value of the ship plus a return on capital over a lease term, which often corresponds with the major part of the economic life of the ship.

## Example 2

Ship  Lessor-HK,  resident  in  Hong  Kong,  leased  a  ship  to  Ship Operator-F, resident in Jurisdiction-F, for a term of 15 years.    The present  value  of  the  aggregate  minimum  lease  payments  was  more than 80% of the fair market value of the ship.    At the end of the lease term, Ship Operator-F was given an option to purchase the ship at a nominal price of $100.

The present value of the aggregate minimum lease payments was more than 80% of the fair market value of the ship.    At the end of the lease term, Ship Operator-F (i.e. the lessee) was allowed to acquire the ship at a nominal price and the property in the ship would probably pass to the lessee.    In the circumstances, the lease would be regarded as a funding lease.

22. The  term  'funding  lease'  has  been  defined  in  connection  with  an arrangement which satisfies certain conditions.    The definition is extended to include  an  agreement  or  another  arrangement  in  connection  with  such  an arrangement.    A funding lease usually contains provisions which ensure that the lessee can exercise an option to purchase the ship at a price sufficiently lower than the market value of the ship at the date the option is exercised; or the lessee can require the lessor to sell the ship and pay most of the proceeds to it by way of a rental rebate at the end of the lease term.    Thus, any separate agreement or arrangement like purchase option agreement or rental rebate agreement may be regarded as forming part of the lease and would be taken into account when determining whether the lease together with the agreement or arrangement is a funding  lease.    If  a  purchase  option  merely  allows  the  lessee  to  acquire  the property in the ship at its fair market value at the end of the lease term, it would be treated as a separate transaction not connected with the arrangement.    If the

rental rebate received upon disposal of the ship represents no more than the costs of arranging a sale of the ship (e.g. a commission at market rate), it would be regarded as a separate transaction not connected with the arrangement.    In short, the Commissioner has to decide whether the property in the ship, whether in form and in substance, will or may pass to the lessee at the end of the lease term.

## Example 3

Ship Lessor-HK and Ship Operator-HK, both resident in Hong Kong, entered into a lease under which Ship Operator-HK was granted a right to use a ship for a term of 20 years.    The ship had a remaining useful  economic  life  of  22  years.    By  a  separate  agreement,  Ship Operator-HK was entitled to require Ship Lessor-HK to sell the ship and pay 99% of the sale proceeds to Ship Operator-HK by way of rental rebate at the end of the lease term.

The lease term was more than 65% of the remaining useful economic life of the ship.    By a separate agreement, which was an agreement or arrangement in connection with the lease, Ship Operator-HK (i.e. the lessee) was entitled to receive the majority of the proceeds of the ship  after  all  the  lease  payments  had  been  paid.    All  the  risks  and rewards associated with the ownership of the ship were substantially transferred to the lessee.    In the circumstances, the lease would be treated as a funding lease.

## Hire-purchase agreement and conditional sale agreement

23. The terms 'hire-purchase agreement' and 'conditional sale agreement' are defined in section 2(1).    'Hire-purchase agreement' means an agreement for the bailment of goods under which the bailee may buy the goods, or under which the property in the goods will or may pass to the bailee.    'Conditional sale  agreement'  means  an  agreement  for  the  sale  of  goods  under  which  the purchase price or part of the purchase price is payable by instalments, and the property in the goods remains in the seller (notwithstanding that the buyer is to be  in  possession  of  the  goods)  until  such  conditions  as  to  the  payment  of instalments or otherwise as may be specified in the agreement are fulfilled.    The bailee is given a purchase option under a hire-purchase agreement while transfer of title is conditional upon full payment of purchase price or other conditions (i.e.

retention of title) under a conditional sale agreement.    Similar to a funding lease, these  financing  agreements  transfer  substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards incidental to ownership of a ship to the bailee or buyer.    The ship lessor is no more  than  a  financier  if  the  ship  is  leased  to  a  ship  lessee  by  way  of  these financing agreements.

## Qualifying ship leasing activity

Definition of qualifying ship leasing activity

24. Under  section  14O(5),  a  ship  leasing  activity  carried  out  by  a corporation in respect of a ship is a qualifying ship leasing activity if:
2. (a) the  activity  is  carried  out  in  the  ordinary  course  of  the corporation's business carried on in Hong Kong; and
3. (b) the ship is -
4. (i) of over 500 gross tonnage as determined in accordance with the formula set out in regulation 6 of the Merchant Shipping  (Registration)  (Tonnage)  Regulations  (Cap. 415C); and
5. (ii) navigating solely or mainly outside the waters of Hong Kong.

In the ordinary course of business

25. A ship leasing activity has to be carried out in the ordinary course of a qualifying ship lessor's business carried on in Hong Kong.    As such, artificial transactions structured with a view to shifting profits from other tax jurisdictions will  not  qualify  for  the  profits  tax  concessions.    The  Commissioner  would examine the terms of the lease agreement, financing arrangement and all other relevant circumstances to determine if a ship leasing activity is carried out bona fide in the ordinary course of a qualifying ship lessor's business carried on in Hong Kong.

## Size and navigation of ship

26. The ship has to be over 500 gross tonnage and navigating solely or mainly outside the waters of Hong Kong.    Thus, the profits tax concession will not cover smaller size sea-going ships such as tugs, commercial yachts, pleasure vehicles and ships of any size navigating between any location within the waters of Hong Kong.

## TAX BASE

## The minimum tax rate

27. Under the global anti-base erosion rules (GloBE Rules) proposed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), if the effective tax rate in respect of profits assigned to or payments (e.g. interest and royalties) made to constituent entities in Hong Kong is lower than the minimum tax rate, adjustments for charging further taxes may be required in respect of such profits or payments.    Therefore, the tax base has to be defined since the concessionary  tax  rate  for  qualifying  ship  lessors  may  require  an  upward adjustment from the zero rate upon the introduction of a minimum tax rate.

## Tax base for operating lease

## Compensation for loss of depreciation allowances

28. Since depreciation allowances under Part 6 of the Ordinance in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on the provision of the ship concerned are not granted to a qualifying ship lessor by virtue of section 14Q(1), the qualifying ship lessor is eligible for a 20% tax base concession as a compensation for loss of  the  depreciation  allowances.    Section  14R(1)  and  (2)  provides  that  if  the profits tax concession applies to a qualifying ship lessor and the qualifying ship leasing activity concerned relates to an operating lease, the net lease payments for the right to use a ship under the operating lease that are to be included in the assessable  profits  derived  from  the  qualifying  ship  leasing  activity  will  be computed in accordance with the following formula:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- where:  A means the net lease payments;
- B means the aggregate amount of the gross lease payments (whether or not they are periodic payments and including any sum payable under a residual value guarantee) earned by  or  accrued  to  the  qualifying  ship  lessor  under  the operating  lease  during  the  basis  period  for  the  year  of assessment;
- C means  the  aggregate  amount  of  any  outgoings  and expenses deductible under Part 4 of the Ordinance to the extent to which they are incurred during the basis period for the year of assessment by the qualifying ship lessor in the production of those gross lease payments; and
- D means the percentage prescribed in section 2 of Schedule 17FA (i.e. 20%).
29. Such  20%  tax  base  concession  will  not  apply  to  a  qualifying  ship lessor for a year of assessment in the circumstances under section 14R(4).

## Not a ship owner

30. Under section 14R(4)(a), a qualifying ship lessor will not be entitled to the 20% tax base concession if it carries out a qualifying ship leasing activity other than as an owner of the ship concerned (e.g. sub-leasing by an intermediate lessor of a ship owned by a head lessor).    The word 'own' in section 14O(1) normally refers to economic ownership.    Thus, holding the ship in the following capacities is covered:
2. (a) as a lessee under a funding lease;
3. (b) as a bailee under a hire-purchase agreement; and
4. (c) as a buyer under a conditional sale agreement.

31. In substance, funding lease, hire-purchase agreement and conditional sale agreement are financing arrangements whereby the lessee, bailee and buyer are the economic owner of the ship.    The word 'own' is defined to incorporate these  financing  arrangements.    If  a  ship  lessor  acquires  a  ship  through  these financing arrangements, the ownership of the ship would be regarded as having been acquired by the ship lessor even though legal title to the ship has not yet been transferred to the ship lessor.
32. For the purposes of the definition of 'funding lease', section 14O(3) provides  that  it  does  not  include  an  arrangement  if,  in  the  opinion  of  the Commissioner, the property in the ship concerned would reasonably be expected not  to  pass  to  the  lessee  or  an  associate  of  the  lessee  at  the  end  of  its  term. Section  14O(4)  provides  that  a  reference  to  a  hire-purchase  agreement  or conditional sale agreement in the definition of 'own' does not include one under which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the property in the ship concerned would reasonably be expected not to pass to the bailee or buyer, as the case may be.    Therefore, if the property in the ship concerned is expected not to pass to the  lessee,  bailee  or  buyer,  such  a  funding  lease,  hire-purchase  agreement  or conditional sale agreement may be treated as an operating lease.
33. If a ship lessor acquires a ship under a funding lease, hire-purchase agreement or conditional sale agreement and the property in the ship is expected not to pass to the ship lessor, the ship would not be regarded as having been acquired by the ship lessor and the 20% tax base concession would not be granted to the ship lessor.

## No capital expenditure incurred

34. Under section 14R(4)(b), a qualifying ship lessor will not be entitled to the 20% tax base concession if it has not incurred capital expenditure on the provision  of  the  ship  concerned.    The  term  'capital  expenditure'  includes payments incurred for the purpose of obtaining ownership of a ship via a funding lease, hire-purchase agreement or conditional sale agreement.

## Depreciation allowances granted

35. Section  14R(4)(c)  and  (d)  operates  to  deny  the  20%  tax  base concession to a qualifying ship lessor for a year of assessment if:

- (a) depreciation  allowances  under  Part  6  of  the  Ordinance  have been  granted  to  the  qualifying  ship  lessor  or  its  connected person  in  respect  of  the  capital  expenditure  incurred  on  the provision of the ship concerned; or
- (b) capital  allowances  are  granted  to  a  connected  person  of  the qualifying ship lessor, whether in Hong Kong or in a territory outside Hong Kong, for that year of assessment in respect of the  capital  expenditure  incurred  on  the  provision  of  the  ship concerned.

'Connected person' is defined in section 14O(1).    Section 14R(4)(c) and (d) seeks to prevent a qualifying ship lessor and its connected person from obtaining both the depreciation allowances in respect of the ship concerned and the 20% tax base concession which is actually a compensation for loss of such allowances.

## Example 4

Ship  Lessor-HK,  a  qualifying  ship  lessor  resident  in  Hong  Kong, leased  a  ship  to  a  non-Hong  Kong  ship  operator.    The  ship  was previously leased to a Hong Kong ship operator in respect of which Ship Lessor-HK had been granted depreciation allowances.

Ship Lessor-HK was not entitled to the 20% tax base concession and could only be granted the tax rate concession since it had previously been granted depreciation allowances in respect of the ship.

## Example 5

Ship  Lessor-HK,  a  qualifying  ship  lessor  resident  in  Hong  Kong, acquired ownership of a ship from Ship Lessor-F, its connected person resident in Jurisdiction-F, under a funding lease, and then leased the ship to Ship Operator-HK under an operating lease.    Ship Lessor-F was granted capital allowances in Jurisdiction-F in respect of the ship while the ship was leased to Ship Operator-HK by Ship Lessor-HK.

Ship Lessor-HK was not entitled to the 20% tax base concession and would  only  be  granted  the  tax  rate  concession  for  any  year  of assessment where Ship Lessor-F was  granted capital  allowances in Jurisdiction-F in respect of the ship.

## Sale and leaseback arrangement

36. Under a typical sale and leaseback arrangement, a lessee (e.g. a ship operator) sells a used ship to a lessor and leases it back from the lessor under an operating  lease.    Substantial  tax  benefits  can  be  obtained  through  such  an arrangement:
2. (a) the capital gain accrued to the lessee on the sale of the ship may not be taxed or taxed at a reduced rate;
3. (b) the  rentals  paid  under  the  operating  lease  by  the  lessee  are deductible;
4. (c) depreciation  allowances,  based  on  an  increased  value  of  the ship, are granted to the lessor.
37. Section 39E(1)(a) can operate to deny a lessor depreciation allowances in respect of a ship to prevent an overall tax benefit being obtained through a sale and  leaseback  arrangement.    Similarly,  section  14(R)(4)(e)  seeks  to  deny  a qualifying ship lessor carrying out a qualifying ship leasing activity as an owner of  a  ship  the  20%  tax  base  concession,  which  is  a  compensation  for  loss  of depreciation allowances, if the ship was, before the acquisition of the ship by the qualifying  ship  lessor,  owned  and  used  by  the  lessee  (whether  alone  or  with others) or an associate of the lessee (i.e. a sale and leaseback arrangement).    The acquisition of a ship by a qualifying ship lessor includes the holding of the ship as a lessee under a funding lease, a bailee under a hire-purchase agreement and a buyer under a conditional sale agreement.
38. Section 14R(5) provides exception to the general rule that the 20% tax base concession will not be granted under a sale and leaseback arrangement. The exception applies in the following situation:

- (a) the ship concerned was acquired by the qualifying ship lessor from the lessee or an associate of the lessee ( end-user ) with a consideration not more than the consideration paid by the enduser to another person ( supplier ) for acquiring the ship from the supplier; and
- (b) no initial or annual allowances under Part 6 of the Ordinance have been granted to the end-user in respect of the ship before the acquisition of the ship by the qualifying ship lessor.

## Example 6

Ship  Operator-HK  acquired  a ship and used it in a marine transportation  business. After  revaluation,  Ship  Lessor-HK,  a qualifying ship lessor resident in Hong Kong, acquired the ownership of  the  ship  from  Ship  Operator-HK  via  a  funding  lease  at  monthly lease payments.    The present value of the aggregate lease payments was  much  higher  than  the  purchase  cost  of  the  ship  paid  by  Ship Operator-HK.    Ship  Operator-HK  then  leased  the  ship  back  from Ship  Lessor-HK  under  an  operating  lease.    Before  the  sale  and leaseback arrangement, depreciation allowances in respect of the ship had been granted to Ship Operator-HK.

By virtue of section 14(R)(4)(e), Ship Lessor-HK would be denied the 20% tax base concession since the ship was owned and used by Ship Operator-HK before acquisition of the ship by Ship Lessor-HK via the funding  lease.    The  exception  in  section  14R(5)  would  not  apply since:  the  consideration  (i.e.  present  value  of  the  aggregate  lease payments) payable by Ship Lessor-HK was higher than the purchase cost  paid  by  Ship  Operator-HK;  and  depreciation  allowances  had previously  been  granted  to  Ship  Operator-HK.    Only  the  tax  rate concession would be granted to Ship Lessor-HK.

## Example 7

Ship Operator-HK purchased a ship at a price of $100 million from a shipbuilder.    If the purchase was financed by a ship mortgage, the monthly  instalments  would  be  $1.2  million  for  ten  years.    Before

putting  the  ship  into  use,  Ship  Operator-HK  sold  the  ship  to  Ship Lessor-HK, a qualifying ship lessor resident in Hong Kong, at a price of $100 million.    Ship Lessor-HK then leased the ship back to Ship Operator-HK  under  an  operating  lease  at  monthly  rentals  of  $1.1 million for ten years.    Prior to the sale and leaseback arrangement, Ship Operator-HK was not granted any depreciation allowances in respect of the ship.

Ship  Lessor-HK  purchased  the  ship  at  the  same  price  that  Ship Operator-HK paid to the shipbuilder.    No depreciation allowances in respect  of  the  ship  were  granted  to  Ship  Operator-HK. The conditions in section 14R(5) were satisfied.    Ship Lessor-HK would not be denied the 20% tax base concession.    In effect, Ship OperatorHK made use of the sale and leaseback arrangement to  reduce the funding cost for acquiring the use of the ship.    The arrangement was a normal commercial transaction.

39. If section 14R(5) is invoked, it will be necessary for the end-user to submit a disclaimer to the Commissioner in writing within three months of the date  on  which  the  ship  was  acquired,  or  within  such  further  period  as  the Commissioner  may  permit.    Generally,  the  Commissioner  will  not  entertain requests  for  an  extension  of  the  three-month  disclaimer  period.    A  notice  of disclaimer should be accompanied by the following information:
2. (a) a description of the relevant ship;
3. (b) the name and address of the supplier;
4. (c) the date of purchase from, and the price paid to, the supplier;
5. (d) the date of sale to, and the price paid by, the qualifying ship lessor; and
6. (e) the name and address of the qualifying ship lessor.

The  above  information  must  be  supported  by  copies  of  purchase  and  sale agreements or invoices and the lease agreement.

40. After submitting a notice of disclaimer, the end-user might decide to retain the right to claim depreciation allowances and seek to cancel the sale and leaseback arrangement.    The Commissioner is prepared to allow the withdrawal of a disclaimer provided that the relevant assessment has not yet become final and conclusive.

## Tax base for funding lease

No tax base concession

41. In a funding lease, the lessor has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a ship to the lessee.    The ownership of the ship is regarded as having been acquired by the lessee.    The 20% tax base concession, which is a compensation for the loss of depreciation allowances to the owner of the ship, is therefore not provided to the qualifying ship lessor under a funding lease.

## Finance charges or interest

42. A funding lease may be regarded as a financing arrangement under which money is provided to the lessee to buy and use a ship in return for finance charges or interest.    Section 15G deems the finance charges or interest received by or accrued to a ship lessor for granting a right to use a ship under a funding lease as sums received by or accrued to the ship lessor by way of interest on money lent by the ship lessor.
43. According to the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standard 16: Leases , the interest rate implicit in the lease (i.e. the internal rate of return) would be used to compute the finance charges or interest derived from a funding lease.    If the interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease  cannot  be  readily  determined,  the  lessee's incremental borrowing rate may be used.
44. Section  14S(1)  and  (2)  provides  that  if  the  profits  tax  concession applies  to  a  qualifying  ship  lessor  and  the  qualifying  ship  leasing  activity concerned relates to a funding lease, the net lease payments for the right to use a ship  under  the  funding  lease  that  are  to  be  included  in  the  assessable  profits derived from the qualifying ship leasing activity will be computed in accordance with the following formula:

where: E means the net payments of finance charges or interest;

- F means  the  aggregate  amount  of  the  gross  payments  of finance  charges  or  interest  (whether  or  not  they  are periodic payments) earned by or accrued to the qualifying ship lessor under the funding lease during the basis period for the year of assessment;
- G means  the  aggregate  amount  of  any  outgoings  and expenses deductible under Part 4 of the Ordinance to the extent to which they are incurred during the basis period for the year of assessment by the qualifying ship lessor in the  production  of  those  gross  payments  of  finance charges or interest.

## Example 8

Ship  Lessor-HK,  a  qualifying  ship  lessor  resident  in  Hong  Kong, leased a ship to Ship Operator-HK for a term which equalled to 65% of the remaining useful economic life of the ship.    The property in the ship would pass to Ship Operator-HK at the end of the lease term. The lease was accounted for as an operating lease by Ship Lessor-HK.

The lease term was equal to 65% of the remaining useful economic life of the ship and the property in the ship would pass to the lessee at the end of the lease term.    The lease would be regarded as a funding lease though it was accounted for as an operating lease.    The internal rate  of  return  at  which  the  present  value  of  the  aggregate  lease payments  and  the  unguaranteed  residual  value  equalled  to  the  fair value of the ship should be calculated.    The internal rate of return would then be used to compute the gross interest payment eligible for the profits tax concession in accordance with section 14S(2).

## Allocation of gross lease or interest payments

45. If a ship is leased under an operating lease or a funding lease together with  other  dealings  in  pursuance  of  one  bargain,  sections  14R(7)  and  14S(3) empower the Commissioner to allocate an amount of gross lease payments, or an amount of gross payments of finance charges or interest, for the right to use the ship under the lease having regard to all the circumstances of the bargain. The  term  'bargain'  is  defined  in Shorter  Oxford  English  Dictionary as 'discussion between two parties over terms'.    Sections 14R(7) and 14S(3) will apply if the terms of the lease and other dealings are negotiated together such that the gross lease payments or gross payments of finance charges or interest do not reflect the market rental or interest charges for the right to use the ship.

## Example 9

In a sale and leaseback transaction, Ship Operator-HK sold a ship to Ship Lessor-HK, a qualifying ship lessor resident in Hong Kong, at a price below the market value of the ship.    In return, Ship OperatorHK leased back the ship from Ship Lessor-HK under an operating lease at a reduced monthly lease payment.

The difference between the market value and sale price of the ship represents a prepayment of lease payments.    Since the sale price of the  ship  and  gross  lease  payments  were  negotiated  together  in pursuance of one bargain, the Commissioner could adjust the gross lease  payments to include the prepayment of lease payments under section 14R(7).

## Example 10

In a sale and leaseback transaction, Ship Operator-HK sold a ship to Ship Lessor-HK, a qualifying ship lessor resident in Hong Kong, at a price above the market value of the ship.    In return, Ship OperatorHK leased back the ship from Ship Lessor-HK under a funding lease at an inflated monthly interest.

The difference between the sale price and market value of the ship represents additional financing provided by Ship Lessor-HK to Ship

Operator-HK.    Since  the  sale  price  of  the  ship  and  gross  interest payments were negotiated together in pursuance of one bargain, the Commissioner could adjust the gross interest payments to exclude the portion attributable to the additional financing under section 14S(3).

## DEPRECIATION ALLOWANCE AND DISPOSAL

## Denial of depreciation allowance

46. Section 14Q(1) provides that a qualifying ship lessor (i.e. a head lessor as  an  owner  of  a  ship  under  an  operating  lease)  is  not  entitled  to  be  granted depreciation allowances under Part 6 of the Ordinance in respect of the capital expenditure  incurred  on  the  provision  of  the  ship  concerned  for  the  year  of assessment in which the tax concession in section 14P(1) applies.

## Example 11

Ship  Lessor-HK1,  a  qualifying  ship  lessor  resident  in  Hong  Kong, leased a ship it acquired to Ship Lessor-HK2, an intermediate ship lessor  resident  in  Hong  Kong,  under  an  operating  lease. Ship Lessor-HK2, then sub-leased the ship to Ship Operator-F which was resident in Jurisdiction-F.

If  the conditions in section 14P(4)(a) were satisfied and an election was made under section 14P(4)(b), Ship Lessor-HK1 would be given the profits tax concession provided in section 14P(1).    Section 14Q(1) would operate to deny Ship Lessor-HK1 depreciation allowances in respect of its capital expenditure incurred on the ship but Ship LessorHK1 would be eligible for a 20% tax base concession under section 14R(2).

If  Ship Lessor-HK1 was not assessed under section 14P(1), section 39E(1)(c)  would  operate  to  deny  Ship-Lessor  HK1  depreciation allowances in respect of the ship since Ship Lessor-HK2 was not an operator of Hong Kong ship.

Ship Lessor-HK2 would not be entitled to any depreciation allowances since it did not incur any capital expenditure on the provision of the ship.    Even if Ship Lessor-HK2 was a qualifying ship lessor assessed under section  14P(1),  its  profits  would  be  computed  in  accordance with section 14R(3) without any reduction in tax base.

47. Since the tax base is reduced under section 14R(2) to compensate for the loss of depreciation allowances in respect of a ship owned and used by a corporation  for  carrying  out  a  qualifying  ship  leasing  activity,  provisions  in section 37(2E) to (2G) and section 39B(6D) to (6F) are added to provide for deduction of notional annual allowances when calculating depreciation allowances for the ship subsequently used by the corporation in another trade, profession or business to produce  chargeable  profits. Notional  annual allowances will be deducted from the actual cost of the ship for the period during which  the  ship  was  owned  and  used  by  the  corporation  for  carrying  out  the qualifying  ship  leasing  activity  in  respect  of  which  the  tax  concession  under section 14P(1) applies as if such annual allowances had been made available to the corporation since it acquired the ship.

## Example 12

Ship Business-HK, a corporation resident in Hong Kong, acquired a ship at a consideration of $50 million.    In Year 1 and Year 2, Ship Business-HK, a qualifying ship lessor resident in Hong Kong, used the ship  for  carrying  out  a  qualifying  ship  leasing  activity. Ship Business-HK elected for the profits tax concession provided in section 14P(1) and was assessed in accordance with section 14R(2).    In Year 3,  Ship  Business-HK ceased the ship leasing business and used the ship in a transportation business within Hong Kong waters.

Section 39B(6E) would apply since the ship had been used by Ship Business-HK  for  carrying  out  a  qualifying  ship  leasing  activity  in respect  of  which  the  tax  concession  under  section  14P(1)  applied before  being  used  in  a  ship  transportation  business.    Depreciation allowances of the ship for Year 3 would be computed as follows:

|                  |                                                          | $          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Acquisition cost | Acquisition cost                                         | 50,000,000 |
| Less:            | Notional annual allowance for Year 1 ($50,000,000 × 10%) | 5,000,000  |
|                  |                                                          | 45,000,000 |
| Less:            | Notional annual allowance for Year 2 ($45,000,000 × 10%) | 4,500,000  |
|                  |                                                          | 40,500,000 |
| Less:            | Annual allowance for Year 3 ($40,500,000 × 10%)          | 4,050,000  |

## Disposal of ship

48. Section 14P(7) provides certainty to qualifying ship lessors on the tax treatment of gains or losses upon disposal of ships.    The disposal gain in respect of a ship that has been used for carrying out a qualifying ship leasing activity for a continuous period of at least three years immediately prior to its disposal will be treated as a capital gain not chargeable to profits tax.    However, a shorter period (e.g. two years) does not necessarily mean that such a ship is not a capital asset.    The Commissioner would consider the totality of facts and apply case law principles when making a decision.

## QUALIFYING SHIP LEASING MANAGER

## Profits tax concession for qualifying ship leasing manager

49. While  section  14T  contains  the  specific  provisions  relating  to  the profits  tax  concession  for  qualifying  ship  leasing  managers,  the  charging provisions  in  section  14  for  profits  tax  continue  to  be  applicable.    Thus,  a qualifying ship leasing  manager is chargeable to  profits tax under  section  14 since it is carrying on a ship leasing management business in Hong Kong.
50. By virtue of section 14T(1), the qualifying profits of a corporation that is a qualifying ship leasing manager for a year of assessment are charged at:
3. (a) one-half of the corporate profits tax rate specified in Schedule

- 8 for the year of assessment if its qualifying activity is carried out other than for an associated corporation; or
- (b) the same  concessionary profits tax rate applicable to a qualifying ship lessor specified in Schedule 8C for the year of assessment  if  its  qualifying  activity  is  carried  out  for  an associated corporation.

The qualifying profits would include income incidental to profits from a ship leasing management business, like interest income, exchange gains or hedging gains,  as  long  as  the  transactions  are  ancillary  to  the  qualifying  activities. Section 14T(5) stipulates that the tax concession applies to a corporation for a year of assessment only if:

- (a) during the basis period for that year of assessment -
- (i) the central management and control of the corporation is  exercised  in  Hong  Kong  ( the  central  management and control requirement );
- (ii) the activities that produce its qualifying profits for that year are carried out in Hong Kong by the corporation; or arranged by the corporation to be carried out in Hong Kong ( the substantial activities requirement ); and
- (iii) those  activities  are  not  carried  out  by  a  permanent establishment  outside  Hong  Kong  ( the  attribution  to Hong Kong requirement ); and
- (b) the  corporation  has  made  an  election  in  writing,  which  is irrevocable, that the tax concession applies to it.
51. A ship lessor can either carry out the ship leasing management services itself or engage an independent ship leasing manager or a ship leasing manager within its own group (i.e. outsourcing) to perform such services at a service fee. In  effect,  outsourcing  such  services  to  the  group  ship  leasing  manager  is  no different  from  performing  such  services  by  the  qualifying  ship  lessor  itself. Thus, the concessionary tax rate in respect of the qualifying profits derived by a

qualifying ship leasing manager from its associated corporation is the same as the  concessionary  tax  rate  in  respect  of  the  qualifying  profits  derived  by  a qualifying ship lessor for the year of assessment concerned.

## Example 13

Ship  Lessor-HK,  a  qualifying  ship  lessor  resident  in  Hong  Kong, carried out ship leasing activities and managed the leases itself in Year 1.    In Year 2, Ship Lessor-HK engaged Ship Leasing Manager-HK, an  associated  corporation  and  a  qualifying  ship  leasing  manager resident in Hong Kong, to manage the leases, which was a qualifying activity,  on  its  behalf  at  a  service  fee.    The  concessionary  tax  rate applicable to a qualifying ship lessor for Year 2 is 0%.

Since  the  qualifying  activity  was  carried  out  by  Ship  Leasing Manager-HK  for  Ship  Lessor-HK,  an  associated  corporation,  the service fee derived from such qualifying activity would be charged at the concessionary tax rate of 0% for Year 2.

52. 'Ship  leasing  manager'  is  defined  in  section  14O(1)  as  a  person carrying  on  a  business  of  carrying  out  ship  leasing  management  activities. Under  section  14T(2),  a  ship  leasing  manager  is  a  qualifying  ship  leasing manager for a year of assessment if:
2. (a) during the basis period for that year of assessment, it is not a ship operator; and
3. (b) for that year of assessment -
4. (i) it is a dedicated ship leasing manager in accordance with section 14T(3);
5. (ii) it is a ship leasing manager that has satisfied the 'oneyear  safe  harbour'  rule  or  the  'multiple-year  safe harbour' rule under section 14U though it has carried out  in  Hong  Kong  activities  other  than  those  of  a qualifying ship leasing management activity; or

- (iii) it is a ship leasing manager that has been determined by the Commissioner under section 14V(1) as a qualifying ship leasing manager though it satisfies neither of the conditions in (i) and (ii) above.

## Dedicated ship leasing manager

53. The conditions specified in section 14T(3) are that, in the basis period for the year of assessment, the ship leasing manager:
2. (a) has  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong  one  or  more  qualifying  ship leasing management activities; and
3. (b) has  not  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong  any  activity  other  than  a qualifying ship leasing management activity.

Similar to a qualifying ship lessor, only a standalone corporate entity engaging solely in one or more qualifying ship leasing management activities can be a qualifying ship leasing manager eligible for the profits tax concession.    Section 14T(4) provides that in determining whether a ship leasing manager has carried out any activity other than a qualifying ship leasing management activity, only activities that generate income to the ship leasing manager are to be taken into account.

## Irrevocable election

54. Before the  profits  tax  concession  applies,  a  qualifying  ship  leasing manager has to make an election in writing (e.g. in a tax return) as required by section 14T(5)(b).    Once made, section 14T(6) makes the election irrevocable. Thus, a qualifying ship leasing manager does not need to make an election for every year of assessment in which it is entitled to the tax concession.
55. If  section  14T(1)  no  longer  applies  to  a  qualifying  ship  leasing manager, section 14T(7) provides that the election previously made by it ceases to be effective.    In case the qualifying ship leasing manager is entitled to the tax concession again, it is required to make a fresh election.

## Ship leasing management activity

56. Section  1(1)  of  Schedule  17FA  defines  'ship  leasing  management activity', in relation to a person, as any of the following activities:
2. (a) managing another person that is a ship lessor;
3. (b) establishment or administration of a special purpose entity for the purpose of owning a ship by that entity;
4. (c) providing, or arranging for the provision of, finance in obtaining the ownership of a ship by a special purpose entity wholly or partly owned by the person or its associate (or if the person is a corporation, its associated corporation), or evaluating  financial  proposals  from  external  financiers  in relation to the obtaining of that ownership;
5. (d) providing,  or  arranging  for  the  provision  of,  a  guarantee  in respect of a financial or performance obligation as regards the ship  leasing  business  of  a  special  purpose  entity  wholly  or partly owned by the person or its associate (or if the person is a corporation, its associated corporation), or granting security in respect of that business;
6. (e) managing leases;
7. (f) arranging for the procurement or leasing of ships;
8. (g) arranging  for  the  operation,  crewing,  voyage  monitoring, maintenance, repair, certification, insurance, storage, scrapping or modification of ships, or the port agency services or security services for ships;
9. (h) arranging for the evaluation, appraisal, provision or inspection of ships or maintenance facilities for ships (including internal audits of ship quality);
10. (i) arranging for the assessment of the shipping market conditions;

- (j) marketing of leases;
- (k) providing, or arranging for the provision of, finance in obtaining the ownership of a ship by a shipping enterprise from another ship lessor;
- (l) providing  a  residual  value  guarantee  or  contingent  purchase arrangement;
- (m) providing services in relation to a ship leasing activity for or to another person that is a ship lessor;
- (n) overseeing the design and construction of newbuild ships.
57. 'Ship  leasing  activity'  in  section  1(1)  of  Schedule  17FA  includes leasing of a ship by a ship lessor to a ship leasing manager.    Given that 'ship leasing manager' in section 14O(1) means a person carrying on a business of carrying out ship leasing management  activities,  the term  'ship leasing management activity'  in  section  1(1)  of  Schedule  17FA  also  covers  the  ship leasing management activities of a ship leasing manager who leases a ship from a ship lessor.    The ship leasing manager may not be a qualifying ship leasing manager or may be carrying on business outside Hong Kong.
58. Provision of finance in obtaining the ownership of a ship by a special purpose entity or provision of guarantee in respect of a financial or performance obligation as regards the ship leasing business of a special purpose entity, or arranging for provision of such services, refers to intra-group financial-related activity carried out for the special purpose entity wholly or partly owned by a ship  leasing  manager.    Pure  financial-related  activities  performed  by  a  ship leasing manager for a person, other than a special purpose entity wholly or partly owned by the ship leasing manager, would fall outside the scope of the ship leasing management activities.
59. Residual value guarantee or contingent purchase arrangement may be provided by a ship leasing manager so as to reduce the risk of the lessor in respect of the residual value of the ship at the end of the lease term or its useful economic life.    'Residual  value  guarantee',  in  relation  to  a  ship,  is  defined  in  section 14O(1) as a financial commitment to pay a sum by reference to the amount by

which the estimated residual value of the ship exceeds the actual residual value of the ship. In section  1(3)  of  Schedule  17FA,  'contingent  purchase arrangement'  is  defined  to  mean  an  arrangement  under  which  a  person  is required to purchase a ship at a pre-determined amount if the actual residual value falls below the estimated residual value.

60. If a qualifying ship leasing manager, at the request of a qualifying ship lessor, provides finance to a ship operator for acquiring a ship from the qualifying ship lessor, the qualifying ship leasing manager is assisting the qualifying ship lessor to dispose  of  its  ship.    Such  activity  is  regarded  as  having  been  carried  out  for the qualifying ship lessor and would qualify for the profits tax concession if other criteria are satisfied.
61. The expression 'services in relation to a ship leasing activity for or to another person that is a ship lessor' is wide in its meaning.    It would include provision of services to ship lessors in connection with repossession of ships and remarketing of ships.    It would also cover provision of advice on the disposal of ships.

## Qualifying ship leasing management activity

62. Under section 14O(7), a ship leasing management activity carried out by a corporation in respect of a ship is a qualifying ship leasing management activity if:
2. (a) the  activity  is  carried  out  in  the  ordinary  course  of  the corporation's business carried on in Hong Kong;
3. (b) the  activity  is  carried  out  for  another  corporation  during  the basis period of the other corporation for a year of assessment;
4. (c) the other corporation is a qualifying ship lessor for that year of assessment; and
5. (d) the ship is leased by the other corporation to a ship lessor, ship leasing manager or ship operator when the activity is carried out.

63. A qualifying ship leasing management activity must be carried out for a qualifying ship lessor in the ordinary course of the business carried on by a qualifying  ship  leasing  manager  in  Hong  Kong.    In  such  circumstances,  the qualifying ship lessor and qualifying ship leasing manager become parties privy to the ship leasing arrangement.

## Safe harbour rule

64. Section 14U lays down the safe harbour rule, which seeks to allow corporations  having  profits  and  assets  primarily  for  qualifying  ship  leasing management activities to be entitled to the profits tax concessions in respect of the qualifying profits.    There are two alternative safe harbours:
2. (a) a corporation falls within the 'one-year safe harbour' in section 14U(2) if, for the year of assessment concerned, the percentages  of  its  ship  leasing  management  profits  (SLMP percentage)  and  ship  leasing  management  assets  (SLMA percentage) are not lower than the prescribed percentages as set out in sections 3 and 4 of Schedule 17FA (i.e. 75%);
3. (b) a corporation falls within the 'multiple-year safe harbour' in section 14U(3) if, for the year of assessment concerned and the preceding one or  two years of assessment, the average percentages  of  its  ship  leasing  management  profits  and  ship leasing  management assets are not lower than the prescribed percentages as set out in sections 3 and 4 of Schedule 17FA (i.e. 75%).
65. The  SLMP  and  SLMA  percentages  of  a  corporation  for  a  year  of assessment are calculated in accordance with the following formulas in section 14U(5) and (6):

## (a) SLMP percentage

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where: SLMP means  the  aggregate  amount  of  the  ship leasing management profits of the

corporation in the basis period for the year of assessment; and

- P means the aggregate amount of profits accruing to the corporation from all sources, whether in Hong Kong or not, in the basis period for the year of assessment.

## (b) SLMA percentage

S LMA

A

where:

SLMA  means the aggregate value of the ship leasing management assets of the corporation as at the  end  of  the  basis  period  for  the  year  of assessment; and

- A means  the  aggregate  value  of  all  assets, whether in Hong  Kong  or  not, of the corporation as at the end of the basis period for the year of assessment.

66. 'Ship  leasing  management  profits',  as  defined  in  section  14O(1), means any profits of a corporation that are derived from a qualifying ship leasing management activity.    In this context, 'ship leasing management profits' would generally  be  based  on  the  accounting  profits  shown  in  the  audited  income statement of the ship leasing manager, irrespective of the source of the profits.

67. A ship leasing manager has to follow the arm's length principle when transacting with a ship lessor that is an associate.    It is expected that the ship leasing  manager  would  make  an  arm's  length  profit  from  a  qualifying  ship leasing management activity carried out for such a ship lessor.    In exceptional circumstances, where a ship leasing manager incurs a substantial loss from a qualifying ship leasing management activity (e.g. the qualifying ship lessor has become  insolvent  and  the  debt  has  become  bad),  the  Commissioner  would consider excluding the loss when computing the ship leasing management profits percentage for the purpose of the safe harbour rule or exercising his discretion under section 14V.

68. 'Ship leasing management asset', as defined in section 14O(1), means an  asset  of  a  corporation  used  by  it  to  carry  out  a  qualifying  ship  leasing management activity.    It would include fixed assets such as business premises and office equipment used by a ship leasing manager to carry out qualifying ship leasing management activities.    The asset values would be based on the audited statement  of  financial  position  of  the  ship  leasing  manager,  regardless  of  the location of the assets.    Generally, intangibles not recorded in the statement of financial position in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles would not be taken into account.
69. Section 14U(7) provides for apportionment of the value of an asset which  is  used  partly  for  carrying  out  a  qualifying  ship  leasing  management activity and partly for another purpose.    In computing the aggregate value of the ship leasing management assets, only the part of the value of an asset that is proportionate to the extent to which the asset is used to carry out a qualifying ship leasing management activity is to be taken into account.
70. There may be cases whereby a ship leasing manager also acts as the holding company for a leasing group.    Where the equity investment in group companies is substantial  or  the  dividend  income  is  not  insignificant,  the  safe harbour rule may not be satisfied since the equity investment in group companies and  dividend  income  do  not  fall  within  the  definitions  of  'ship  leasing management asset' and 'ship  leasing  management  profits'  respectively.    As dividend income is generally not taxable in Hong Kong, the Commissioner is prepared to exclude equity investment in group companies and dividend income from the denominators in the above formulas for the calculation of the SLMA and SLMP percentages so that such a ship leasing manager may also be regarded as a qualifying ship leasing manager under the safe harbour rule.
71. Under  the  multiple-year  safe  harbour  rule  in  section  14U(4),  the 'consecutive' years of track record of a corporation are to be examined.    The average SLMP and SLMA percentages must be computed based on the audited financial statements of a corporation for the subject year and the preceding two years of assessment.    Where a corporation has carried on a trade, profession or business  in  Hong  Kong  for  less  than  two  consecutive  years  of  assessment immediately before the subject year, only the corporation's profits and assets for the  subject  year  and  the  preceding  year  of  assessment  would  be  taken  into account for computing the average SLMP and SLMA percentages.

## Example 14

Ship  Leasing  Manager-HK  claimed  the  half  rate  concession  under section 14T(1)(a) for Year 4.    It had the following track record:

| Year   | Business Activity in Hong Kong   |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| Year 1 | Active Business                  |
| Year 2 | Dormant Business                 |
| Year 3 | Active Business                  |
| Year 4 | Active Business                  |

Though Ship Leasing Manager-HK had three years of active business operations in Hong Kong, it was dormant in Year 2.    Ship Leasing Manager-HK would be regarded as having two years of track record. The average SLMP and SLMA percentages would be computed based on its audited financial statements for Year 3 (i.e. the preceding year) and Year 4 (i.e. the subject year).

## Commissioner's determination

72. Section  14V  allows  the  Commissioner  to  exercise  his  discretion  to determine that a corporation is a qualifying ship leasing manager for a year of assessment despite that it fails to satisfy the conditions specified in section 14T(3) and the safe harbour rule under section 14U.    Such a determination would be made by the Commissioner under section 14V(3) if the Commissioner is of the opinion that the conditions specified in section 14T(3), or the safe harbour rule, would, in the ordinary course of business of the corporation, have been satisfied for the year of assessment.
73. When exercising the discretion under section 14V, the Commissioner would look into the totality of facts, in particular, the types of qualifying ship leasing management activities that a corporation would carry out in the ordinary course of its business.    The Commissioner may consider the following factors:
3. (a) the activities carried out by the corporation;
4. (b) the assets and liabilities of the corporation;

- (c) the  capacities,  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  corporation's employees;
- (d) the functions and risks undertaken by the corporation; and
- (e) the operational history of the corporation.

## LOSS TREATMENTS

## Losses sustained by a qualifying ship lessor

74. The  treatment  for  losses  sustained  by  a  qualifying  ship  lessor  is provided under section 14X(1).    If section 14P(1) applies to a qualifying ship lessor for a zero-tax year of assessment (i.e. a year of assessment for which the concessionary tax rate applicable to a qualifying ship lessor is 0%), any loss sustained by the qualifying ship lessor in the year of assessment is not available for set off against its assessable profits for any subsequent year of assessment.

## Example 15

In Year 1, Ship Lessor-HK, a qualifying ship lessor resident in Hong Kong, sustained a loss of $200,000 from qualifying activities.    The concessionary tax rate applicable to a qualifying ship lessor for Year 1 was 0%.    In Year 2, Ship Lessor-HK ceased to be a qualifying ship lessor and derived assessable profits of $300,000.    Ship Lessor-HK elected to be chargeable at the two-tiered profits tax rates (the lowertier profits tax rate was 8.25%) for Year 2.

Since section 14P(1) applied to Ship Lessor-HK for Year 1 which was a zero-tax year of assessment, the loss sustained by Ship Lessor-HK in Year  1  could  not  be  used  to  set  off  against  its  assessable  profits derived in Year 2.    The tax payable by Ship Lessor-HK for Year 2 would be $24,750 ($300,000 × 8.25%).

## Losses sustained by a qualifying ship leasing manager

75. The  treatment  for  losses  sustained  by  a  qualifying  ship  leasing manager is provided under section 14X(2).    If section 14T(1)(b) applies to a qualifying ship leasing manager for a zero-tax year of assessment (i.e. a year of assessment for which the concessionary tax rate applicable to a qualifying ship leasing manager is 0% in respect of profits derived from its qualifying activity carried out for an associated corporation), any loss sustained by the qualifying ship leasing manager in the year of assessment is not available for set off against its  assessable  profits  for  the  year  of  assessment  or  any  subsequent  year  of assessment.

## Example 16

Ship  Leasing  Manager-HK,  a  qualifying  ship  leasing  manager resident in Hong Kong, elected for the profits tax concessions provided in section 14T(1).    Its trading results were as follows:

| Year 1                                                                          | $        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Loss from qualifying activities carried out for an associated ship lessor       | (50,000) |
| Profits from qualifying activities carried out for a non-associated ship lessor | 100,000  |
| Year 2                                                                          |          |
| Profits from qualifying activities carried out for an associated ship lessor    | 30,000   |
| Profits from qualifying activities carried out for a non-associated ship lessor | 70,000   |

For Year 1 and Year 2, the concessionary tax rates applicable to a qualifying ship leasing manager were: 0% if a qualifying activity was carried out for an associated ship lessor; and 8.25% (½ × 16.5%) if a qualifying activity was not carried out for an associated ship lessor.

Since section 14T(1)(b) applied to Ship Leasing Manager-HK for Year 1 which was a zero-tax year of assessment, the loss sustained by Ship Leasing Manager-HK from its qualifying activities carried out for an associated ship lessor in Year 1 could not be used to set off against its assessable profits derived in Year 1 and Year 2.    The tax payable by Ship Leasing Manager-HK would be:

Year 1: $100,000 × 8.25% = $8,250

Year 2: $30,000 × 0% + $70,000 × 8.25% = $5,775

## Cross loss set off

76. By virtue of sections 19CAB 1 , 19CAC and 19CB, if a qualifying ship leasing manager has both concessionary profits or loss (derived from qualifying activities in respect of which the assessable profits are taxed at a concessionary tax  rate  specified  in  Schedule  8C  other  than  0%)  and  normal  profits  or  loss (derived from non-qualifying activities in respect of which the assessable profits are taxed at a normal tax rate specified in Schedule 8) for any year of assessment, it is necessary to apply an 'adjustment factor' (i.e. the ratio which the normal and concessionary tax rates bear to each other) to the profits or loss to be set-off for that year of assessment or any subsequent year of assessment.

## Example 17

Ship  Leasing  Manager-HK,  a  qualifying  ship  leasing  manager resident in Hong Kong, elected for the profits tax concession provided in section 14T(1)(a).    It satisfied the safe harbour rule and carried out both qualifying activities for a non-associated ship lessor and nonqualifying activities.    Its trading results were as follows:

1 In  the  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)(Profits  Tax  Concessions  for  Insurance-related  Businesses) Ordinance 2020, sections 19CAB and 19CAC were added to the principal Ordinance to recast section 19CA(1), (2) and (3).

## Scenario 1

|                                                  | $        |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Concessionary loss from qualifying activities    | (70,000) |
| Normal profits from non-qualifying activities    | 30,000   |
| Scenario 2                                       |          |
|                                                  | $        |
| Concessionary profits from qualifying activities | 60,000   |
| Normal loss from non-qualifying activities       | (40,000) |

For Year 1 and Year  2,  the  concessionary  tax  rate  applicable  to  a qualifying ship leasing manager carrying out a qualifying activity for a  non-associated  ship  lessor  was  8.25%  (½ × 16.5%)  and  the adjustment factor was 2 (16.5% ÷ 8.25%).

The tax computation would be:

## Scenario 1

|                                       | Qualifying activities $   | Non-qualifying activities $   |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| (Concessionary loss)/normal profits 1 | (70,000)                  | 30,000                        |
| Less: Cross loss set off              | 60,000 2                  | (30,000)                      |
| Loss carried forward 3                | (10,000)                  |                               |
| Assessable profits                    |                           | Nil                           |

## Notes:

1. Section 19CAB(3) applies as the amount of concessionary loss exceeds  the  amount  of  normal  profits  as  multiplied  by  the adjustment factor (i.e. $70,000 &gt; $30,000 × 2).
2. Normal profits multiplied by the adjustment factor (i.e. $30,000 × 2).
3. Loss  carried  forward  for  set  off  against  profits  for  subsequent years of assessment in accordance with sections 19C and 19CB.

## Scenario 2

|                                           | Qualifying activities $   | Non-qualifying activities $   |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Concessionary profits/(normal loss) 1     | 60,000                    | (40,000)                      |
| Less: Cross loss set off                  | (60,000)                  | 30,000 2                      |
| Assessable profits Loss carried forward 3 | Nil                       | (10,000)                      |

## Notes:

1.  Section 19CAC(3) applies as the amount of normal loss exceeds the amount of concessionary profits as divided by the adjustment factor (i.e. $40,000 &gt; $60,000 ÷ 2).
2. Concessionary  profits  divided  by  the  adjustment  factor  (i.e. $60,000 ÷ 2).
3.  Loss carried forward for set off against profits for subsequent years of assessment in accordance with sections 19C and 19CB.

## SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS PRESENCE

## Tax treaty benefits

77. The 2015 Final Report of Action 6 on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting -  Preventing  the  Granting  of  Treaty  Benefits  in  Inappropriate  Circumstances released by the OECD has identified tax treaty abuses, and in particular treaty shopping, as one of the most critical concerns of base erosion and profit shifting. Hong  Kong,  as  a  member  of  the  Inclusive  Framework,  is  committed  to implementing the minimum standard on Action 6, which entails the inclusion in Hong Kong's tax treaties an express statement that the common intention of the contracting parties is to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance (including through treaty-shopping arrangements), and the implementation of this common intent through, among others, the principal purposes test.

78. Though there is no restriction on the place of incorporation, qualifying ship lessors and qualifying ship leasing managers need to ensure that they have a substantial business presence in Hong Kong.    Any artificial arrangement to transfer existing leasing arrangements from other jurisdictions to Hong Kong for the purpose of obtaining unintended tax treaty benefits might not be acceptable under  the  terms  of  a  tax  treaty.    It  is  legitimate  for  Hong  Kong's  tax  treaty partners to rely on the principal purposes test to deny tax treaty benefits.

## Central management and control

79. Given the statutory requirements in sections 14P(4)(a)(i) and 14T(5)(a)(i), the central management and control (CMC) of a qualifying ship lessor and qualifying ship leasing manager must be exercised in Hong Kong. The  CMC  is  located  in  Hong  Kong  if  the  executive  officers  and  senior management employees of the qualifying ship lessor and qualifying ship leasing manager exercise day-to-day responsibility for more of their strategic, financial and operational policy decision-making in Hong Kong and conduct more of the day-to-day  activities  necessary  for  preparing  and  making  those  decisions  in Hong Kong, than in any other jurisdiction.
80. The CMC test is a well-established common law rule adopted in many jurisdictions,  such as Singapore, the United  Kingdom  and  Australia,  in determining the residence of a company.    The common law rule was enunciated by Lord Loreburn in De Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd v Howe, 5 TC 198 at page 213:
3. '… a company resides, for purposes of Income Tax, where its real business is carried on. … I regard that as the true rule; and the real business is carried on where the central management and control actually abides.'
81. In Bywater Investments Ltd and Others v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia; Hua Wang Bank Berhad v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia 260 CLR 169, the High Court of Australia, in considering whether a company had its CMC exercised in Australia, held at page 208:

- 'As  a  matter  of  long-established  principle,  the  residence  of  a company  is  first  and  last  a  question  of  fact  and  degree  to  be answered according to where the central management and control of the company actually abides.    As a matter of long-established authority,  that  is  to  be  determined,  not  by  reference  to  the constituent documents of the company, but upon a scrutiny of the course of business and trading … Each case depends on its own facts  and  circumstances,  albeit  that  those  cases  that  have  been decided may provide a degree of guidance in relation to those still to come.'

The High Court also rejected at page 202 the notion that a company should be taken to be resident where its board meetings are held even if the meetings are mere window dressing comprised of rubber-stamping decisions actually made elsewhere by others and held in that place in the hope of avoiding tax liability in the place where the decisions are actually made.

82. The CMC refers to the highest level of control and direction of the operations of a company.    The key element in the control and direction of a company's  operations  is  the  making  of  the  high-level  decisions  that  set  the company's general policies, and determine the direction of its operations and the type of transactions it will enter into.    Mere implementation, or rubberstamping, of decisions made by others does not constitute the making of high-level decision.
83. The location of CMC is wholly a question of fact.    Each case must be decided on its own facts.    Factors that are decisive in one case may carry little weight in another.    When reaching a conclusion in accordance with the case law principles, only factors which exist for genuine commercial reasons would be considered.    In general, if the CMC of a company is exercised by the directors in  board  meetings,  the  relevant  locality  is  where  those  meetings  are  held. However, the place of board meetings may not be conclusive.    It is significant only in so far as those meetings constitute the medium through which CMC is exercised. In cases where CMC of a company is in fact exercised by an individual (e.g. the board chairman  or  the  managing  director),  the  relevant  locality  is  the  place  where  the controlling individual exercises his power.

## Substantial activities

84. The 2015 Final Report of Action 5 on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting -Countering  Harmful  Tax  Practices  More  Effectively,  Taking  into  Account Transparency and Substance released by the OECD contains detailed guidance on the application of the substantial activities criterion to intellectual property regimes as well as more general guidance for the application of the substantial activities  criterion  to  non-intellectual  property  regimes. The  substantial activities  requirement  ensures  that  the  ship  leasing  functions  or  ship  leasing management functions are performed in Hong Kong, the assets including the ships  concerned are acquired or  monitored  in/from Hong Kong and the risks associated with the ship leasing business or ship leasing management business are undertaken in Hong Kong.
85. To  satisfy the substantial activities requirement under sections 14P(4)(a)(ii) and 14T(5)(a)(ii), the core income generating activities (CIGAs) which produce the qualifying profits of a qualifying ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing  manager have to be carried out, or arranged to be carried out, by the qualifying ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing manager in Hong Kong.    The word 'arranged' covers the situation where a qualifying ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing manager arranges a third party or an associated person to carry out some of the CIGAs (i.e. outsourcing).    If outsourcing takes place, the CIGAs must also be carried out by the third party or associated person in Hong Kong. The CIGAs include those activities listed out in the definitions of 'ship leasing activity'  and  'ship  leasing  management  activity'  in  section  1(1)  of  Schedule 17FA.    While a qualifying ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing manager may perform  different  types  of  CIGAs  to  produce  its  qualifying  profits,  all  these activities must be carried out or arranged to be carried out by the qualifying ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing manager in Hong Kong.

## Facts and circumstances

86. Taking note that different corporations may  have different business models,  all  the  relevant  facts  and  circumstances  should  be  considered  when determining  whether  the  CMC  and  substantial  activities  requirements  are satisfied. For  the  year  in  which  a  ship  leasing  activity  commences,  it  is important to submit for the Commissioner's consideration a realistic business plan for carrying out the ship leasing activity in Hong Kong.    Since SPVs are

often used to hold a ship, it may be necessary to consider whether an SPV lessor has sufficient connection or nexus with the active conduct of ship leasing activity in Hong Kong, including the engagement of a ship leasing manager carrying on business in Hong Kong.

## Example 18

Ship Lessor-F set up SPV-HK in Hong Kong for holding a ship which was leased to Ship Operator-F at a non-arm's length rent.    Both Ship Lessor-F and Ship Operator-F were resident in Jurisdiction-F.    SPVHK did not have any employees in Hong Kong.    Nor was it managed by  a  qualifying  ship  leasing  manager  in  Hong  Kong.    It  had  two nominee  directors  and  used  the  business  address  of  a  Hong  Kong secretarial firm as its registered address.

The leasing arrangement seemed to be used for shifting income from Jurisdiction-F  to  Hong  Kong  for  tax  avoidance  purpose.    SPV-HK did not have business substance in Hong Kong except merely owning the ship.    In the circumstances, SPV-HK did not satisfy the CMC and substantial  activities  requirements  and  could  not  be  entitled  to  the profits tax concession provided in section 14P(1).

## Example 19

Ship Lessor-F set up SPV-HK in Hong Kong for leasing ships to Ship Operator-F.    Both Ship Lessor-F and Ship Operator-F were resident in Jurisdiction-F.    All the directors of SPV-HK were non-Hong Kong residents.    SPV-HK  was  not  managed  by  a  Hong  Kong  qualifying ship leasing manager and had no employees and business premises in Hong Kong.

Clearly, SPV-HK did not satisfy the CMC and substantial activities requirements and could not be entitled to the profits tax concession provided in  section  14P(1).    Further,  if  Jurisdiction-F  had  concern regarding  the  purpose  of  such  arrangement,  Jurisdiction-F  might invoke the principal purposes test under its double taxation agreement with  Hong  Kong  to  deny  any  unintended  treaty  benefits  since Jurisdiction-F's resident was disguised as a Hong Kong tax resident.

There had to be strong commercial justification for such an arrangement from the perspective of Jurisdiction-F.    SPV-HK had to have significant business substance in Hong Kong so as to be eligible for the profits tax concession.

## Attribution to Hong Kong

87. Apart from the CMC and substantial activities requirements, sections 14P(4)(a)(iii)  and  14T(5)(a)(iii)  stipulate  that  the  CIGAs  of  a  qualifying  ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing manager must not be carried out by a permanent establishment outside Hong Kong.    If the CIGAs are carried out in Hong Kong by employees of a non-Hong Kong permanent establishment and the relevant staff costs and associated expenses are attributed to such permanent establishment, the ship lessor or ship leasing manager would fail to satisfy this attribution to Hong Kong requirement.

## SUBSTANTIAL ACTIVITIES REQUIREMENT

## Preferential regime

88. In the Harmful Tax Practices - 2018 Progress Report on Preferential Regimes published  by  the  OECD  in  January  2019,  it  is  explained  that jurisdictions  must  require  taxpayers  to  have  an  adequate  number  of  full-time employees  with  necessary  qualifications  and  to  incur  an  adequate  amount  of operating expenditure to undertake the CIGAs associated with the income that may benefit from a preferential regime.

## Threshold requirements

89. By virtue of section 14W and sections 5 and 6 of Schedule 17FA, a CIGA is not considered to be carried out, or arranged to be carried out, by a qualifying ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing manager in Hong Kong unless the following threshold requirements are met during the basis period for the year of assessment concerned:

|                                             | Threshold requirements                                                                                       | Threshold requirements                                                                |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CIGA                                        | Average number of full-time employees in Hong Kong having the necessary qualifications to carry out the CIGA | Total amount of operating expenditure incurred in Hong Kong for the CIGA              |
| Qualifying ship leasing activity            | Adequate in the opinion of the Commissioner and in any event not less than 2                                 | Adequate in the opinion of the Commissioner and in any event not less than $7,800,000 |
| Qualifying ship leasing management activity | Adequate in the opinion of the Commissioner and in any event not less than 1                                 | Adequate in the opinion of the Commissioner and in any event not less than $1,000,000 |

## Qualified full-time employees

90. Full-time employees who carry out CIGAs for a qualifying ship lessor or  qualifying  ship  leasing  manager  must  be  in  Hong  Kong  and  have  the qualifications  necessary  for  carrying  out  the  CIGAs  in  Hong  Kong.    These qualified full-time employees include leasing manager, marketing manager, legal counsel, financial controller and credit risk analyst.    The term 'full-time' is not defined and should be given its ordinary meaning.    According to the Oxford Dictionary  of  English,  the  word  'full-time'  means  'occupying  or  using  the whole  of  someone's  available  working  time'. Any  full-time  employee performing CIGAs outside Hong Kong, lacking the requisite qualifications to perform  the  CIGAs  or  performing  only  non-profit  generating  activities  (e.g. clerical or support services) would not be taken into account.
91. The 'average number of full-time employees' during a basis period shall be calculated as: the aggregate of the number of employees as at the end of each calendar month in the basis period as divided by the number of calendar months in the basis period.

## Example 20

During  the  basis  period  from  January  to  December  for  a  year  of assessment, qualified full-time employees employed by Ship LessorHK, a qualifying ship lessor resident in Hong Kong, for carrying out CIGAs in Hong Kong were as follows:

|                       |   Number of qualified full-time employees as at the end of each calendar month |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| January to April      |                                                                              1 |
| May to August         |                                                                              2 |
| September to December |                                                                              3 |

The average number of full-time qualified employees in Hong Kong during the basis period would be computed as: (1 × 4) + (2 × 4) + (3 × 4) ÷ 12 = 2.    The threshold requirement was satisfied.

## Operating expenditure incurred

92. Operating expenditure must be incurred in Hong Kong for carrying out the CIGAs of a qualifying ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing manager in Hong  Kong.    The  word  'incurred'  is  not  confined  to  actual  payment  and includes an accrued liability to pay.    The activities giving rise to  an accrued liability to pay must be undertaken in Hong Kong.
93. Operating expenditure is any expenditure incurred as part of the main business  operations  or  principal  revenue  producing  activities. In  general, operating  expenditure  in  relation  to  ship  leasing profits or ship leasing management profits includes rental expenses, staff costs and related expenses, other  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses.    Finance  costs  or  interest expenses that are directly attributable to the acquisition of a ship for use in a qualifying ship leasing activity are considered as an operating expenditure.

## Example 21

Ship  Lessor-HK,  a  qualifying  ship  lessor  resident  in  Hong  Kong, incurred interest expenses on a loan taken out for acquiring a ship for use in qualifying ship leasing activities.    The loan was provided to

Ship Lessor-HK by an overseas financial institution resident outside Hong Kong.

If the interest expenses were incurred for the purpose of acquiring a ship for use in carrying out qualifying ship leasing activities in Hong Kong, the interest expenses would be accepted as operating expenditure incurred by Ship Lessor-HK in Hong Kong though the loan might be provided by an overseas financial institution.

## Example 22

The CIGAs of Ship Lessor-HK, a qualifying  ship lessor resident in Hong  Kong,  were  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong  by  the  employees employed by an associated corporation resident in Hong Kong.    The staff costs of the employees were fully borne by Ship Lessor-HK.

The employees employed by the associated corporation for carrying out the CIGAs in Hong Kong and the staff costs of the employees borne by Ship Lessor-HK would be taken into account in determining whether the threshold requirements were satisfied.

## Example 23

The CIGAs of Ship Lessor-HK, a qualifying  ship lessor resident in Hong  Kong,  were  carried  out  in  Hong  Kong  by  the  employees seconded to Hong Kong from an overseas associate.    The staff costs of the seconded employees based in Hong Kong were fully borne by Ship Lessor-HK.    The seconded employees were answerable to Ship Lessor-HK.

The employees seconded from the overseas associate for carrying out the CIGAs in Hong Kong and the staff costs of the employees borne by  Ship  Lessor-HK  would  be  taken  into  account  in  determining whether the threshold requirements were satisfied.

94. Insofar  as  depreciation  in  respect  of  assets  is  concerned,  it  is  not regarded  as  an  operating  expenditure  unless  such  assets  are  directly  used  for carrying out the CIGAs of a qualifying ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing manager in Hong Kong.    Since a ship acquired by a qualifying ship lessor is used for earning lease payments but not for carrying out the CIGAs, depreciation of the ship cannot be accepted as an operating expenditure.    If a qualifying ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing manager acquired substantial assets in Hong Kong, the depreciation of these assets might well have exceeded the threshold requirement  for  operating  expenditure.    However,  the  substantial  activities requirement would not be considered as having been satisfied unless an adequate number of employees are employed in Hong Kong to use the assets for carrying out the CIGAs in Hong Kong.

## Adequacy test

95. The thresholds of the average number of qualified full-time employees and the total amount of operating expenditure prescribed in sections 5 and 6 of Schedule 17FA only serve as the minimum requirements that a ship lessor or ship leasing manager must satisfy in order that the CIGAs are accepted as having been carried out in Hong Kong.    The ship lessor or ship leasing manager will not be entitled to the profits tax concessions under the preferential regime if any of the thresholds is not met.    However, it does not follow that the ship lessor or ship leasing manager is entitled to the tax concessions if the thresholds are met.    To be eligible for the tax concessions, the ship lessor or ship leasing manager has to demonstrate  that  the  'adequacy  test'  has  been  satisfied  (i.e.  the  number  of qualified  full-time  employees  in  Hong  Kong  and  the  amount  of  operating expenditure incurred in Hong Kong must be adequate to carry out the CIGAs for the derivation of the income given the tax concessions).    For the purpose of applying the 'adequacy test', the Commissioner would consider the totality of facts of each case, including:
2. (a) business operation and strategy of the ship lessor or ship leasing manager;
3. (b) amount of assessable profits in respect of which tax concession is claimed;

- (c) types and level of CIGAs undertaken by the ship lessor or ship leasing manager in Hong Kong;
- (d) details  of  the  employees employed in Hong Kong, including their level of experience and qualifications, position held and duties performed;
- (e) amount  and  types  of  the  operating  expenditure  incurred  in Hong Kong;
- (f) number  of  employees  employed  and  amount  of  operating expenditure  incurred  by  other  ship  lessors  or  ship  leasing managers in Hong Kong that are comparable, in terms of scale of business operation or types and level of business activities, to the ship lessor or ship leasing manager concerned.

If the amount of assessable profits of a ship lessor or ship leasing manager to be benefited  from  the  tax  concessions  is  disproportionately  large  relative  to  the number  of  employees  employed  and  the  amount  of  operating  expenditure incurred in Hong Kong, the ship lessor or ship leasing manager would not be considered as having carried out all the CIGAs in Hong Kong and cannot be entitled to the tax concessions.

## Example 24

Ship Lessor-HK1, a ship lessor resident in Hong Kong, leased a large fleet  of  20  ships  to  various ship  operators under short term leases. Ship Lessor-HK1 derived assessable profits of $100 million from the ship leasing activities whilst it employed four full-time employees and incurred  operating  expenditure  of  $10  million.    Ship  Lessor-HK2, another ship lessor resident in Hong Kong comparable in terms of business operation and types of activities to Ship Lessor-HK1, derived assessable  profits  of  $50  million  whilst  it  employed  20  full-time employees and incurred operating expenditure of $50 million.

The amount of assessable profits of Ship Lessor-HK1 was disproportionately large relative to the number of full-time employees employed and the amount of operating expenditure incurred in Hong Kong, in particular  when  compared  with  that  of  Ship  Lessor-HK2. Although the minimum requirements could be met, Ship Lessor-HK1 prima  facie  failed  to  satisfy  the  adequacy  test  and  would  not  be considered as having carried out all the CIGAs in Hong Kong.    If there  is  no  sufficient  evidence  to  support  that  the  profits  were produced by the CIGAs carried out in Hong Kong, Ship Lessor-HK1 would not be entitled to the profits tax concession provided in section 14P(1).

## Outsourcing to associated person

96. Outsourcing of CIGAs is permitted by the OECD provided that the use of outsourcing is not for circumventing the substantial activities requirement. For the purpose of satisfying the substantial activities requirement, outsourcing of CIGAs by a qualifying ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing manager to an associated person is permitted if the following requirements are satisfied:
2. (a) the  CIGAs are carried out by  the associated person in Hong Kong;
3. (b) the  CIGAs  are  carried  out  by  the  associated  person  at  a  fee charged to the qualifying ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing manager on an arm's length basis;
4. (c) the number of qualified full-time employees employed and the amount  of  operating  expenditure  incurred  by  the  associated person are commensurate with the level of the CIGAs carried out by the associated person in Hong Kong; and
5. (d) the qualifying ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing manager has exercised adequate monitoring to ensure that the outsourced CIGAs are carried out by the associated person in Hong Kong.

A  person  is  associated  with  another  person  if  one  of  the  relevant  persons  is participating in the management, control or capital of the other relevant person, or the same person or persons is or are participating in the management, control or capital of each of the relevant persons.    If the above conditions are satisfied, the number of qualified full-time employees employed by, and the amount of service fee paid to, the associated person for carrying out the CIGAs in Hong Kong would be taken into account when determining whether the substantial activities  requirement  is  met  by  the  qualifying  ship  lessor  or  qualifying  ship leasing manager.

## Monitoring of substantial activities

97. The Forum on Harmful Tax Practices (FHTP) of the OECD requires substantial activities whereby:
2. (a) jurisdictions must require CIGAs to be performed and establish mechanisms to review compliance with this requirement; and
3. (b) the FHTP will monitor the jurisdiction's effective implementation of the substantial activities requirement.
98. For the purpose of reviewing compliance with the substantial activities requirement and monitoring the substantial activities requirement, ship lessors and ship leasing managers intend to be benefited from the profits tax concessions are required to provide the following information annually:
5. (a) whether the ship lessors or ship leasing managers perform the CIGAs in Hong Kong;
6. (b) the types of the CIGAs carried out in Hong Kong;
7. (c) the number of qualified full-time employees employed and the amount of operating expenditure incurred in Hong Kong for carrying out the CIGAs in Hong Kong; and
8. (d) the amount of assessable profits to be given the tax concession.

The  information  will  be  reported  to  the  FHTP  on  an  annual  basis.    If  the

information shows that the substantial activities requirement is not satisfied, no tax concessions will be given.

## ANTI-AVOIDANCE PROVISIONS

## Disqualified from profit tax concessions

99. Sections  14P(6)(b)  and  14T(7)(b)  provide  that  if  section  14P(1)  or 14T(1) does not apply to a corporation for a year of assessment ( cessation year ), such corporation is not allowed to re-enter the preferential tax regime for the year of  assessment following the cessation  year.    These  provisions  are  to  prevent abuse and protect fiscal revenue as a corporation may opt in when it derives profits from qualifying operations in order for the concessionary tax rate to apply; and then opt out when it suffers losses in a subsequent year of assessment in order to obtain deduction of losses at full rate.
100. If a qualifying ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing manager merely incurs a tax loss from its qualifying operations, it would not be disqualified from being entitled to the profits tax concessions.    Section 19D(1) provides that the amount of loss incurred by a person chargeable to profits tax for any year of assessment shall be computed in like manner and for such basis period as the assessable profits for that year of assessment would have been computed.    Thus, if a qualifying ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing manager incurs a tax loss for a year of assessment, section 14P(1) or 14T(1) remains applicable and the tax loss  would  be  dealt  with  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  in  sections  14X, 19CAB or 19CAC.

## Arm's length principle

101. Section  14Y(1)  and  (2)  ensures  that  the  chargeable  profits  from  a transaction between a qualifying ship lessor and its associate in connection with a qualifying ship leasing activity are determined by reference to the amount of profits  that  would  have  accrued  had  the  same  transaction  been  carried  out  at arm's  length  terms  between  parties  who  are  not  associates  (i.e.  arm's  length principle). The  same  principle  also  applies  to  a  qualifying  ship  leasing management activity of a qualifying ship leasing manager by virtue of section 14Y(3) and (4).

102. 'Associate' is defined in section 14O(1) whereas section 14Y(1) to (4) sets out the conditions under which profits may be subjected to adjustment in respect of the transactions in connection with:
2. (a) a  qualifying  ship  leasing  activity  between  a  qualifying  ship lessor and its associate; or
3. (b) a  qualifying  ship  leasing  management  activity  between  a qualifying ship leasing manager and its associate.

## Defeasance arrangement

103. Section 14Z forestalls defeasance arrangements.    Under an operating lease which is a head lease as defined in section 14O(1), a qualifying ship lessor carrying out a qualifying ship leasing activity has to be an owner of the ship concerned (e.g. the ship can be obtained via an ownership arrangement like a funding lease, hire-purchase agreement or conditional sale agreement).    A ship lessor  under  an  ownership  arrangement,  however,  may  be  released  from  the primary  obligation  under  the  ownership  arrangement  to  a  third  party  (i.e. defeasance arrangement).    The third party takes up the primary obligation to make  payments  to  the  head  lessor,  bailor  or  seller  under  the  ownership arrangement.    The effect of a defeasance arrangement is that the ship lessor is no longer obliged to make payments under the ownership arrangement.    In such a scenario, section 14Z would come into operation and the ship lessor would be treated as if it had ceased to own the ship when applying the provisions relating to the profits tax concessions under the preferential regime.

## Main purpose tests

The anti-avoidance provisions

104. Section 14ZA introduces main purpose tests to prevent tax avoidance and treaty shopping.    If the Commissioner is satisfied that the main purpose, or one of  the  main  purposes,  of  entering  into  an  arrangement  is  to  obtain  a  tax benefit in relation to a liability to pay profits tax under the Ordinance or under a tax treaty, no profits tax concessions will be granted in respect of the assessable profits  accrued  during  the  basis  period  in  which  the  arrangement  has  effect. 'Arrangement' is defined in section 2(1) to include:

- (a) any agreement, arrangement, understanding, promise or undertaking, whether express or implied, and whether or not enforceable or intended to be enforceable, by legal proceedings; and
- (b) any scheme, plan, proposal, action or course of action or course of conduct.

## Tax benefit

105. 'Tax benefit' is defined in section 14ZA(4) to mean an avoidance, postponement or reduction of a liability to pay tax.    The definition contemplates the following situations:

- (a) the  avoidance  of  liability  by  getting  out  of  the  way  of  or escaping from or preventing an anticipated liability to tax in respect of income which has 'accrued' to the taxpayer;
- (b) the postponing of liability for tax by shifting the incidence of tax on an amount or stream of income to a later year or years; and
- (c) the reduction in the amount of tax by altering the quantum of assessable income to a level lower than it would have been or might  reasonably  be  expected  to  have  been  but  for  the arrangement.

## Main purpose or one of the main purposes

106. The expression 'main purpose or one of the main purposes' is widely used  in  the  Ordinance  and  Double  Taxation  Agreements.    Cases  including Marwood Homes Ltd v IRC [1999] STC (SCD) 44, Snell v RCC [2008] STC (SCD) 1094, Lloyds TSB Equipment Leasing (No. 1) Ltd v RCC [2014] STC 2770 and Travel Document Service &amp; Ladbroke Group International v HMRC [2018] STC 723 confirm that an arrangement can have more than one main purpose and obtaining a tax advantage can be a main object of an arrangement.    In order for a  purpose  to  be  'main',  it  must  have  a  connotation  of  importance.    The reference to 'one of the main purposes' means that obtaining tax benefit does

not need to be the sole or dominant purpose of a particular arrangement.    An arrangement may have more than one main purpose and it is sufficient that at least one was to obtain the tax benefit, even if that was not the dominant purpose.

107. Before reaching a conclusion under the main purpose test, all relevant facts and circumstances have to be considered, including:
2. (a) the manner in which the arrangement was structured;
3. (b) the terms of the arrangement;
4. (c) the ways of implementing the arrangement;
5. (d) the  result  which  the  arrangement  intended  to  achieve  or achieved;
6. (e) the  non-tax  purposes  of  the  arrangement  and  any  alternative way that the non-tax purposes could be achieved;
7. (f) the  form  (i.e.  contractual  rights  and  obligations  created)  and substance  (i.e.  practical  or  commercial  end  result)  of  the arrangement;
8. (g) the functions, assets and risks of each entity in the arrangement; and
9. (h) the contractual rights and obligations normally created, and the commercial  or  financial  relationships  normally  entered  into, between independent persons under an arrangement of the kind in question.

## Tax avoidance arrangement

108. Section 14ZA(1) operates to deny profits tax concessions in respect of profits accrued under an arrangement entered into by a qualifying ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing manager if the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of  the  arrangement  is  to  obtain  a  tax  benefit,  whether  for  the  qualifying  ship lessor  or  qualifying  ship  leasing  manager  or  another  person,  in  relation  to  a

profits  tax  liability.    The  provision  aims  at  those  who  seek  to  abuse  the  tax concessions by entering into a tax avoidance arrangement to avoid, postpone or reduce a profits tax liability.

## Treaty shopping arrangement

109. In a cross border leasing arrangement, a sub-lease is often created or inserted  for  treaty  shopping  purposes  without  genuine  commercial  reasons. Tax  administrations  are  often  concerned  about  significant  risks,  emerging  or recurring, arising from cross border leasing arrangements.    The diagram below illustrates a cross border leasing arrangement in which a sub-lease is inserted for treaty shopping purposes:

<!-- image -->

110. A head lessor in Hong Kong intending to lease a ship to a ship operator in Jurisdiction-F2, which does not have a tax treaty with Hong Kong, would first lease the ship to an intermediate lessor (e.g. an associated corporation which is a conduit without commercial substance) set up in Jurisdiction-F1 which has a tax treaty with Jurisdiction-F2.    The intermediate lessor in Jurisdiction-F1 would further sub-lease the ship to the ship operator in Jurisdiction-F2.    Through such a  treaty  shopping  arrangement,  overall  tax  benefits  may  well  be  obtained  as follows:
2. (a) withholding tax on the lease payments paid to the intermediate lessor by the ship operator in Jurisdiction-F2 would be reduced under the tax treaty between Jurisdiction-F1 and JurisdictionF2 (i.e. a tax benefit contrary to the purpose of the tax treaty);
3. (b) income tax is not likely to be imposed by Juridiction-F1 on the intermediate lessor in respect of the lease payments received since the income tax (computed on a net basis) would be wiped out by the withholding tax (computed on a gross basis) imposed by Juridiction-F2; and
4. (c) tax concession under section 14P(1) would be given by Hong Kong to the head lessor in respect of the lease payments received.
111. Section 14ZA(2) operates to deny profits tax concessions in respect of profits accrued under a cross border sub-leasing arrangement entered into by a qualifying ship lessor if the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the arrangement is to obtain a tax benefit under a tax treaty that is contrary to the purpose of the treaty (i.e. treaty shopping).    'Tax treaty' is defined in section 14ZA(4)  to  mean  an  arrangement  made  between  two  or  more  jurisdictions (whether including Hong Kong or otherwise) with a view to affording relief from double taxation.
112. If an arrangement is used to secure a benefit by improper use of a tax treaty or treaty abuse, then the benefit obtained would be contrary to the purpose of the treaty.    If a benefit obtained in the relevant circumstances is in accordance with the object and purpose of a tax treaty (e.g. bona fide exchanges of goods and services, and movements of capital and persons), there should not be any improper use of a tax treaty or treaty abuse.

## Anti-tax arbitrage rule

113. Section 16(1A) as amended prevents tax arbitrage through ship leasing transactions between connected persons.    'Connected person' has the meaning given by section 16(1C) and (1D).    For example, if a Hong Kong ship operator (i.e. the lessee) pays a sum, whether directly or through an interposed person, to its connected qualifying ship lessor, who is eligible to enjoy the tax concession under section 14P(1), the sum that could be deducted by the Hong Kong ship operator  in  computing  its  assessable  profits  would  be  reduced  such  that  the profits tax payable by the Hong Kong ship operator is increased by reference to the amount of the reduction in the profits tax payable by the qualifying ship lessor in  respect  of  the  sum  for  the  year  of  assessment  or  any  subsequent  year  of assessment.    The expression 'by reference to the amount of the reduction in the profits  tax  payable'  refers  to  the  reduction  in  the  profits  tax  liability  of  the qualifying entity due to the reduced tax rate as mentioned in section 16(1A)(c), which includes a tax rate of 0% under section 16(3E).    When ascertaining the amount of deduction that could be allowed to the connected person under section 16(1A), the 20% tax base concession would be ignored.

## Example 25

Ship Lessor-HK, a qualifying ship lessor resident in Hong Kong, leased a ship to Ship Operator-HK, its connected person which operated a ship for transportation of goods between Hong Kong and Macau.    For Year 1, the lease payments charged by Ship Lessor-HK were $12 million and the  operating  expenses  incurred  by  Ship  Lessor-HK  were  $7  million. Ship Lessor-HK had not claimed depreciation allowances in respect of the  ship  before  and  elected  for  the  profits  tax  concession  provided  in section 14P(1).    For Year 1, the concessionary tax rate applicable to a qualifying ship lessor was 0% and the lower-tier profits tax rate was 8.25%.

For Year 1, Ship Lessor-HK was exempt from the payment of profits tax in respect of its assessable profits of $1,000,000 (i.e. ($12,000,000 - $7,000,000) × 20%).    If Ship Lessor-HK had been subject to tax at the two-tiered profits tax rates, its profits tax payable would have been $82,500  (i.e.  $1,000,000  ×  8.25%). The  tax  saving  due  to  the reduction in tax rate was $82,500.

For Ship Operator-HK, half of its profits derived from uploading of goods  in  Hong  Kong  was  assessed  to  profits  tax  whilst  half  of  its profits derived from uploading of goods in Macau was not taxable. If Ship Operator-HK was subject to tax at the two-tiered profits tax rates in respect of the chargeable profits for Year 1, the amount of the lease payment allowed for deduction by Ship Operator-HK might be adjusted as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

114. Section  16(1A)  can  nullify  the  tax  benefits  obtained  when  a  ship operator subject to full tax rate shifts income to its connected qualifying ship lessor.    By operation of section 16(1B), the provisions in section 16(1A) will not be invoked to restrict deduction of management fees paid by a qualifying ship lessor to its connected qualifying ship leasing manager for qualifying ship leasing management services provided if the qualifying ship lessor is subject to a  concessionary  tax  rate  lower  than  or  the  same  as  that  applicable  to  the qualifying ship leasing manager.

## Limitation of lessee's interest deduction

115. By virtue of section 16(3D):
2. (a) for the purposes of section 16(1)(a), the payments of finance charges or interest by a lessee for a right to use a ship under a funding lease in the production of profits are regarded as sums payable by way of interest on money borrowed by the lessee ( specified loan ) for the purpose of producing the profits; and
3. (b) the specified loan is regarded as money borrowed wholly and exclusively  to  finance  capital  expenditure  incurred  by  the lessee on the provision of the ship and satisfies the condition under section 16(2)(e)(i)(A).

The effect of the provisions is that deduction of the finance charges or interest incurred by the lessee will be subject to the secured-loan test and interest flowback test under section 16(2A) and (2B).

## Secured-loan test under section 16(2A)

116. Deduction of finance charges or interest on a specified loan payable by a lessee will be restricted under section 16(2A) if at any time during the basis period of the lessee in respect of which the deduction is claimed:
2. (a) the payments of any finance charges or interest or the payment of any principal of the specified loan is secured or guaranteed, whether wholly or in part and whether directly or indirectly, by a deposit or loan;
3. (b) the said deposit or loan is made by the lessee or its associate with  or  to  the  lessor,  a  financial  institution,  an  overseas financial institution or an associate of any of these parties; and
4. (c) the  deposit  or  loan  generates  interest  income  that  is  not chargeable to tax in Hong Kong.
5. 'Associate'  is  defined  in  section  16(3).    Section  16(2A),  if  applicable,  will reduce the deduction of finance charges or interest by an amount calculated on a basis  as  is  most  reasonable  and  appropriate  in  the  circumstances  of  the  case, having regard to the amount of interest income arising from the deposit or loan in question.

## Example 26

Ship Lessor-HK and Ship Lessee-HK entered into a ten-year funding lease for the use of a ship with an annual lease payment of $5 million. The  lease  liability  of  Ship  Lessee-HK  (i.e.  the  present  value  of  the aggregate lease payments, discounted at the interest rate of 5% per annum) was $35 million.    For Year 1, the lease payment contained an interest expense at $1.7 million.    As security for the acquisition of the  ship  under  the  funding  lease,  Ship  Lessee-HK  provided  to  an overseas  associate  of  Ship  Lessor-HK:  a  deposit  of  $20  million (earning tax-free interest of $200,000 per annum); and shares valued at $15 million.

For Year 1, the amount of interest deduction allowable to Ship LesseeHK would be reduced by the amount of tax-free interest it earned from the deposit.    In other words, the amount of allowable interest would be $1,500,000 ($1,700,000 - $200,000).

Interest flow-back test under section 16(2B)

117. Deduction of the finance charges or interest payable on a specified loan by a lessee will be restricted under section 16(2B) if at any time during the basis period of the lessee in respect of which the deduction is claimed:
2. (a) an arrangement is in place, whether between the lessee and the lessor or otherwise;
3. (b) the finance charges or interest payable on the specified loan or any part of the specified loan will be paid, directly or through an interposed person, back to the lessee or its connected person under the arrangement; and
4. (c) the lessee or its connected person is not an 'excepted person' within the meaning of section 16(2E)(c) (i.e. a person who is charged to tax under the Ordinance in respect of the finance charges  or  interest  in  question,  a  financial  institution,  an overseas financial institution, etc.).
118. The provision in section 16(2B) applies where the said arrangement is in place, irrespective of whether the passing of finance charges or interest has actually occurred, at any time during the basis period concerned.    Under section 16(2E)(b), any payment of finance charges or interest to a trustee or a corporation controlled by the trustee is deemed to be a payment to each of the trustee, the corporation and the beneficiary under the trust.

## Example 27

Under a funding lease of a ship, Ship Lessee-HK paid finance charges to Ship Lessor-HK, an unrelated person, on the condition that Ship Lessor-HK  would  pay  an  amount  equal  to  the  finance  charges  to Lender-F, a connected person of Ship Lessee-HK resident in Jurisdiction-F, by way of interest under a loan made to Ship LessorHK under a sub-participation arrangement.    Lender-F was not an overseas financial institution.

The finance charges paid by Ship Lessee-HK in relation to the funding lease  would  be  treated  as  sums  payable  by  way  of  interest  on  a specified  loan  borrowed  by  Ship  Lessee-HK  for  the  purpose  of producing profits.    In this example, an arrangement was in place such that the tax-deductible finance charges paid by Ship Lessee-HK were paid back to Lender-F , its connected person who was not an excepted person.    The  finance  charges  paid  by  Ship  Lessee-HK  would  be denied deduction.

## Restriction of lessee's capital allowances

119. In a funding lease, the ownership of the ship is regarded as having been acquired by the lessee and depreciation allowances in respect of the ship are therefore granted to the lessee.    In a sale and leaseback transaction where a seller-lessee sells a used ship that has appreciated in value to a buyer-lessor and leases the ship back from the buyer-lessor under a funding lease, depreciation allowances, based on the increased value of the ship, can be granted to the sellerlessee again under such transaction.
120. Section 14Q(2) seeks to prevent double benefits of capital allowances provided to the seller-lessee in a sale and leaseback transaction.    If a person (i.e. a seller-lessee), whether alone or with others and whether directly or through an interposed person, transfers a ship by way of sale to a qualifying ship lessor (i.e. a buyer-lessor), and the qualifying ship lessor subsequently leases the ship to the person or an associate of the person under a funding lease, which is a qualifying ship leasing activity, the transfer is not treated as a sale of the ship concerned for the purposes of Part 6 of the Ordinance.    The following diagram illustrates a typical sale and leaseback structure as envisaged under section 14Q(2):

<!-- image -->

121. If the transfer of the ship is not treated as a sale of the ship for the purposes of Part 6 of the Ordinance, the seller-lessee would continue to claim depreciation  allowances  on  the  reducing  value  of  the  ship  as  if  the  sale  and leaseback transaction had not occurred and need not make balancing charge or balancing allowance adjustment in respect of the ship.    On the other hand, the ship lessor would not be regarded as the owner of the ship.

## Example 28

Ship Owner-HK1, a non-qualifying ship lessor resident in Hong Kong, acquired  a  ship  at  a  price  of  $40  million  and  used  the  ship  in  its chartering  business  for  two  years.    Under  a  sale  and  leaseback arrangement, Ship Owner-HK1 transferred the ship to Ship LessorHK,  a qualifying ship lessor resident in Hong  Kong,  in the consideration of $50 million and Ship Owner-HK2, an associate of Ship Owner-HK1 resident in Hong Kong, leased the ship back from Ship Lessor-HK under a funding lease.    At the time of transfer, the reducing value of the ship, after deduction of depreciation allowances granted to Ship Owner-HK1, was $13 million.

By virtue of section 14Q(2), the transfer of the ship from Ship OwnerHK1 to Ship Lessor-HK would not be treated as a sale of the ship for the purposes of Part 6 of the Ordinance.    Ship Owner-HK1 would continue to be eligible for depreciation allowances in respect of the ship  on  its  reducing  value  at  $13  million.    No  balancing  charge adjustment  would  be  required.    Ship  Lessor-HK  and  Ship  Owner-

HK2 would not be regarded as having acquired the ownership of the ship. Thus,  Ship  Owner-HK2  would  not  be  entitled  to  claim depreciation allowances in respect of the ship.

## INCOME FROM SHIP BUSINESS OR MANAGING SHIP BUSINESS

## Codification of case law principles

122. Section  15(1)  sets  out  various  sums  that  are  regarded  as  trading receipts  arising  in  or  derived  from  Hong  Kong  from  a  trade,  profession  or business carried on in Hong Kong, and hence are chargeable to profits tax.    The provisions  in  section  15(1)(o)  ensure  that  sums  received  by  or  accrued  to  a corporation by way of gains or profits (other than those arising from the sale of capital  assets)  arising  through  or  from  the  carrying  on  in  Hong  Kong  by  the corporation of:
2. (a) its business of granting a right to use a ship to another person ( ship business ); or
3. (b) its  business  of  managing  a  corporation  carrying  on  a  ship business or of managing a ship business

are chargeable to profits tax even if the ship concerned is used outside Hong Kong.    Section 15(1E) ensures that the finance charges or interest received by or accrued to a corporation for granting a right to use a ship under a funding lease are treated as sums received by or accrued to the corporation by way of gains or profits.

123. Section 15(1)(o) makes it clear that the 'operation test' applies in the determination of the source of income derived from a ship leasing business or ship leasing management business.    The principle of the 'operation test' laid down in CIR v Hang Seng Bank Ltd , [1991] 1 AC 306 and expanded in CIR v HK-TVB International Ltd , [1992] 2 AC 397 is that 'one looks to see what the taxpayer has done to earn the profit in question and where he has done it'.    Thus, the focus should be the place where the CIGAs are performed by the ship lessor or ship leasing manager and not the place where the ship is used by the ship operator.

124. Given the CMC and substantial activities requirements, any qualifying profits  derived  from  the  qualifying  ship  leasing  activities  or  qualifying  ship leasing  management  activities  of  a  qualifying  ship  lessor  or  qualifying  ship leasing manager should be sourced from Hong Kong and chargeable to profits tax.    The  application  of  the  'operation  test'  on  income  arising  from  a  ship leasing  business  or  ship  leasing  management  business  follows  the  current practice of the Department.    Section 15(1)(o) merely codifies this practice and the  legal  principles  found  in  case  law. No  new  taxation  principle  was introduced in the Ship Leasing Amendment Ordinance and no change has been made to the legal principles by section 15(1)(o).

## COMMENCEMENT DATE

## Commencement of profits tax concessions and deeming provision

125. Regarding  the  effective  date,  sums  received  by  or  accrued  to  a qualifying ship lessor or qualifying ship leasing manager before 1 April 2020 are not to be taken into account for the purpose of computing the qualifying profits under section 14P(1) or 14T(1).    In other words, sums accrued before 1 April 2020 but received after that day will not be eligible for the profits tax concessions. For the provisions in section 15(1)(o), they do not apply to sums received or accrued  before  the  commencement  date  of  the  Ship  Leasing  Amendment Ordinance (i.e. 19 June 2020).

## ADVANCE RULINGS

## Ruling on specific transaction

126. To secure tax certainty, a request in respect of a specific transaction or structuring may be made to the Commissioner for a ruling on how the provisions in  sections  14P  and  14T  are  to  apply  to  the  applicant.    The  Commissioner requires maximum disclosure for advance ruling applications and a fee needs to be paid.    Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 31 explains the procedures and requirements for making advance ruling applications.    Such a ruling,  if  required,  will  be  sent  to  the  competent  authority  of  the  relevant jurisdiction  with  which  Hong  Kong  has  an  arrangement  for  exchange  of

information. The  information  and  documents  required  to  be  provided  in  an application for a ruling are set out in Appendix.

## CERTIFICATE OF RESIDENT STATUS

## Issuance of certificate of resident status

127. Since withholding tax is normally imposed on ship rentals, a Hong Kong ship lessor may be required to provide a Hong Kong certificate of resident status to the lessee upon delivery of a ship so that treaty benefits may be claimed in  the  jurisdiction  in  which  the  lessee  resides. This  may  be  a  condition precedent to be satisfied by a lessor prior to the commencement of a lease if the lessee bears the obligation to pay the withholding tax.    Qualifying ship lessors satisfying  the  CMC  and  substantial  activities  requirements  should  be  able  to obtain  a  certificate  of  resident  status  from  the  Department.    The  application form (IR1313A or IR1313B) can be furnished to the Department together with supporting documents such as a copy of the management agreement entered into with a Hong Kong qualifying ship leasing manager.    If a ship lessor is newly established in Hong Kong, submission of a five-year business plan and details of its liability to pay Hong Kong profits tax may be provided to the Department for determining whether it is a Hong Kong tax resident.

128. As a rule, tax credit would not be allowed to the qualifying ship lessor if the withholding tax on ship rentals is borne by the lessee.
