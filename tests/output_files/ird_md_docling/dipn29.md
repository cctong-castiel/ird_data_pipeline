## INTRODUCTION

With  the  reversion  of  the  sovereignty  of  Hong  Kong  to  the  People's Republic of China (PRC) it is opportune to outline how this will impact on tax relations  between  the  Hong  Kong  Special  Administrative  Region  (HKSAR) and the PRC. The following paragraphs reproduce, for general reference, extracts of the  relevant  provisions  in  the  Basic  Law  and  of  a  speech  made  by  Deputy Commissioner Xiang Huaicheng, State Administration of Taxation, PRC in April 1997.

## THE BASIC LAW

2. Administrative arrangements for the government of the HKSAR, under the principle of 'one country, two systems', are set out in the Basic Law:

Article 5: 'The socialist system and policies shall not be practised in the  Hong  Kong  Special  Administrative  Region,  and  the  previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years.'

Article 8: 'The  laws  previously  in  force  in  Hong  Kong,  that  is,  the common law,  rules  of  equity,  ordinances,  subordinate  legislation  and customary law shall be maintained, except for any that contravene this Law, and subject to any amendment by the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.'

Article 73: 'The Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall exercise the following powers and functions:

(3) To approve taxation ...'

Article 106: 'The  Hong  Kong  Special  Administrative  Region  shall have independent finances.

The  Hong  Kong  Special  Administrative  Region  shall  use  its  financial revenues exclusively for its own purposes, and they shall not be handed over to the Central People's Government.

The Central People's Government shall not levy taxes in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.'

Article 107: 'The  Hong  Kong  Special  Administrative  Region  shall follow the principle of keeping expenditure within the limits of revenues in drawing up its budget, and strive to achieve a fiscal balance, avoid deficits and keep the budget commensurate with the growth rate of its gross domestic product.'

Article 108: 'The  Hong  Kong  Special  Administrative  Region  shall practise an independent taxation system.

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall, taking the low tax policy previously pursued in Hong Kong as a reference, enact laws on its own concerning types of taxes, tax rates, tax reductions, allowances and exemptions, and other matters of taxation.'

Article 151: 'The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region may on its  own,  using  the  name  'Hong  Kong,  China',  maintain  and  develop relations  and  conclude  and  implement  agreements  with  foreign  states and regions and relevant international organizations in the appropriate fields, including the economic, trade, financial and monetary, shipping, communications, tourism, cultural and sports fields.'

Article 153: 'The application to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of international agreements to which the People's Republic of China is or becomes a party shall be decided by the Central People's Government, in accordance with the circumstances and needs of the Region, and after seeking the views of the government of the Region.

International agreements to which the People's Republic of China is not a party but which are implemented in Hong Kong may continue to be implemented  in  the  Hong  Kong  Special  Administrative  Region. The Central  People's  Government  shall,  as  necessary,  authorize  or  assist the government of the Region to make appropriate arrangements for the application to the Region of other relevant international agreements.'

## SPEECH BY DEPUTY COMMISSIONER XIANG HUAICHENG

3. In  the  course  of  a  speech  made  in  Singapore  in  April  1997  Deputy Commissioner  Xiang  Huaicheng  elaborated  on  the  question  of  tax  relations between the HKSAR and the mainland of the PRC.    The following is an extract from his speech:
2. 'In accordance with the Basic Law, after the reunification, Hong Kong will be a special administrative region of the People's republic of China. According to the plan of 'one country, two systems', capitalism will be retained in Hong Kong. As a highly autonomous administrative region, Hong Kong will practice, independently, its own laws and tax system. It will have its own power of tax legislation, design its own taxes, items and rates; confer tax concessions on its own and make its own decisions of  other  tax  affairs  as  well.    After  the  reunification,  tax  laws  and regulations made in the mainland will not be applicable to Hong Kong.
1. The  relationship  between  Hong  Kong  and  the  mainland  with regard  to  concluding  and  implementing  tax  treaties .    According  to Article  153  of  the  Basic  Law,  'The  application  to  the  Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region of international agreements to which the People's Republic of China is or becomes a party shall be decided by the Central People's Government, in accordance with the circumstances and needs of the Region, and after seeking the views of the government of the Region.' In addition, consultation and agreement with the other signatory party is indispensable from the final decision of whether or not to apply the treaties to Hong Kong.

Viewing the practical operation of the 54 tax treaties China signed with foreign countries, none of them is applicable to Hong Kong because the taxes mentioned in all the treaties refer to those of the mainland only.

Since  the  concluding  of  tax  treaties  is based  upon  the  result  of  the negotiation  between  two  signatory  parties  on  their  own  tax  systems, requiring one signatory party with two different tax systems to negotiate with another signatory party having a unitary tax system will encounter unexpected technical barriers when coming to specific articles, not to say the implementation.

Besides, Article 151 of the Basic Law stipulates that 'The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region may on its own, using the name 'Hong Kong,  China',  maintain  and  develop  relations  and  conclude  and implement  agreements  with  foreign  states  and  regions  and  relevant international  organizations  in  the  appropriate  fields,  including  the economic,  trade,  financial  and  monetary,  shipping,  communications, tourism, cultural and sports fields.'    In agreement with the essence, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region may conclude and implement tax treaties and maintain or develop tax relations with other countries, areas  and  international  organizations  using  the  name  'Hong  Kong, China'.

- 2 . Tax issues related to investment in and income obtained from the  mainland  by  Hong  Kong  residents. After the reunification, policies applicable to foreign companies, enterprises, economic organizations and foreign nationals will still be applicable to investment in and income obtained from the mainland China by Hong Kong people. The Central People's Government will continue encouraging Hong Kong people to invest in the mainland. Those who voluntarily  fulfill  their  tax  obligations  in  accordance  with  the  related laws  and  regulations  can  continue  to  claim  for  the  tax  privileges applicable to foreign investors.

Pursuant  to  Article  116  of  the  Basic  Law,  'The  Hong  Kong  Special Administrative Region shall be a separate customs territory'.    After the

reunification,  trade  (purchase  and  sales  of  goods,  excluding  service) between  Hong  Kong  and  the  mainland  will  still  be  regarded  as transaction  between  the  People's Republic  of  China  and  foreign companies, enterprises, or other economic organizations and individuals. That is to say imports from Hong Kong to the mainland will  still  be  levied  (or  reduced  in  or  exempted  from)  custom  duties, value added tax and consumption tax in accordance with the tax laws concerned. Exportations  from  the  mainland  to  Hong  Kong  may  be entitled  to  refunds  (or  exemption) in  agreement  with  the  related regulations.

3. Avoidance of double taxation by Hong Kong and the mainland after  1997. This  is  an  issue  that  attracts  most  widespread  attention from Hong Kong industrial and commercial field.    In late 1980s, Hong Kong  and  the  mainland  tax  authorities  used  to  talk  over  the  issue. Summarizing the tax practice of both Hong Kong and the mainland, we can see that the matter of double taxation avoidance does not prove to be a problem because Hong Kong practices tax jurisdiction policy (i.e. no levy of tax upon the income obtained outside Hong Kong) and the mainland  has  the  stipulation  that  tax  paid  overseas  may  be  credited. After  reunification,  if  double  taxation  occurs  between  the  Hong  Kong Special  Administrative  Region  and  the  mainland,  solutions  shall  be sought  out  through  consultations  between  the  tax  authorities  of  the Central People's Government of the P.R.C. and the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.'
