## INTRODUCTION

## The legal framework

Concessionary  deduction  is  granted  to  persons  for  interest  paid  on mortgages obtained to finance the acquisition of their homes.  Unlike personal allowances in Part 5, which do not apply to persons charged at standard rate, concessionary deductions in Part 4A are granted to all persons subject to salaries tax  or  electing  personal  assessment.    The  implementing  legislation  was  first introduced  by  the  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  Ordinance  1998.    The concessionary deduction for home loan interest, which applies to the year of assessment 1998/99 and all subsequent years, is contained in sections 26E and 26F of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (IRO).

2. No distinction is drawn between residential properties acquired prior to the commencement of the concession on 1 April 1998 and those purchased subsequently.  All residential properties rank equally in terms of the interest paid qualifying  for  the  deduction.      The  maximum  home  loan  interest  deduction allowable in each year is $100,000 except for the years of assessment 2001/02 and 2002/03 which was capped at $150,000.  The maximum year of entitlement was five years (whether continuous or not) initially, and was extended several times  subsequently.    With  effect  from  the  year  of  assessment  2017/18,  the entitlement  years  for  deduction  have  been  extended  to  any  20  years  of assessment.

## HOME LOAN INTEREST

## Conditions for deduction

3. Section 26E(1) provides that a home loan interest deduction is granted to any person who has paid interest on a mortgage loan obtained to purchase a dwelling if the dwelling was used by the person as the person's place of residence at any time during the year of assessment.  The conditions for deduction of home loan interest are:
2. (a) the interest is paid in the year of assessment;
3. (b) the deduction is restricted to the amount of interest paid in the year;
4. (c) the maximum deduction is:
5. (d) the person claiming the deduction is the owner (i.e. either as a sole  owner,  a  joint  tenant  or  a  tenant  in  common)  of  the dwelling;
6. (e) if  there  is  more  than  one  owner,  the  maximum  deduction  is apportioned among the joint tenants in proportion to the number of the joint tenants or the tenants in common on the basis of their ownership as shown in the records of the Land Registry;
7. (f) the dwelling is used by the person as the person's principal place of residence;
8. (g) the  dwelling  is  a  separate  rateable  unit  under  the  Rating Ordinance (Cap.  116)  (i.e.  it  is  a  stand-alone  unit  situated  in Hong Kong);
9. (h) the loan is granted to finance the acquisition of the dwelling;
10. (i) the loan is secured by a mortgage or charge over a Hong Kong property;
11. (j) the lender is an approved body; and
12. (k) the  person  has  not  been  granted  a  deduction  more  than  the entitlement years for deduction, whether continuous or not.

| Year of Assessment   | Amount   |
|----------------------|----------|
| 1998/99 to 2000/01   | $100,000 |
| 2001/02 and 2002/03  | $150,000 |
| 2003/04 and after    | $100,000 |

## Interest paid in the year of assessment

4. Home loan interest deduction is only allowable for interest actually paid in the year of assessment.  For the purposes of the deduction, whether the liability or any part of it, arose prior to or within the year of assessment is not a relevant  consideration.    So  long  as  the  payment  is  made  within  the  year  of assessment, subject to the other qualifying conditions being satisfied, the interest is deductible.  Interest incurred in one year of assessment but not paid until the next year is only deductible in the year of payment.

## Example 1

On  1  December  2018,  Mr.  A  purchased  a  dwelling  with  a  bank mortgage.  Each of the monthly loan repayments, made on 2 January 2019, 1 February 2019, 1 March 2019 and 1 April 2019 respectively, included an interest component of $10,000.

Deduction would be allowed in the following years of assessment:

| Interest Payment Date               | Year of Assessment   |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 2 January 2019, 1 February 2019 and | 2018/19              |
| 1 March 2019 1 April 2019           | 2019/20              |

Interest  payment  made  on  1  April  2019,  though  related  to  interest incurred in the period from 1 March 2019 to 31 March 2019, would be allowed for deduction for the year of assessment 2019/20.

## Deduction restricted to interest paid

5. Personal allowances are prescribed as fixed amounts which may be claimed by persons satisfying the relevant qualifying conditions for entitlement. Concessionary deductions, including home loan interest, differ from personal allowances.  Subject to the maximum amount of deduction, persons are only entitled  to  deduct  the  amount  actually paid.     Persons  claiming  an  amount  in excess of the actual payment made in the year of assessment are subject to the

penalty provisions of the IRO on the same basis as any other persons making false or inflated claims.

## Example 2

Miss B was the sole owner of a dwelling purchased in 2016.  During the year ended 31 March 2019, she paid $20,000 in mortgage interest on a bank loan obtained to finance the purchase.

Miss  B's  allowable  deduction  for  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19 would be limited to $20,000 (i.e. the amount of the interest she paid in the  year)  even  though  the  maximum  amount  of  deduction  was $100,000.

## Maximum deduction

6. Per section 26E(2)(a)(ii), the maximum home loan interest deduction cannot exceed the amount specified for the year of assessment in Schedule 3D. The maximum deduction is allowable to the owner(s) of property who paid interest during a year.  Home loan interest expenses in excess of the statutory maximum deduction  for  any  year  will  lapse.    The  excess  interest  paid  cannot  be  carried forward and claimed as a deduction in any subsequent year of assessment.

## Example 3

- Mr. C was the sole owner of a dwelling purchased in 2016.  He paid home loan interest of $120,000 on his home mortgage during the year ended 31 March 2018.  He was allowed a deduction of $100,000 in his 2017/18 salaries tax assessment.  During the year ended 31 March 2019, Mr. C paid $80,000 in home loan interest.
- Mr.  C  was  only  entitled  to  a  deduction  of  $80,000  for  the  year  of assessment 2018/19.  The excess interest of $20,000 that was paid but not deductible for the year of assessment 2017/18 could not be carried forward  and  allowed  as  a  deduction  for  the  year  of  assessment 2018/19.

## Ownership

## Legal owner

7. Interest will be deductible under section 26E only if it is paid on a home loan.   A 'home loan' is defined in section 26E(9) as, among others, a loan of  money which is applied wholly or partly for the acquisition of a dwelling which is held at any time during the year of assessment by the person as a sole owner, joint tenant or tenant in common.  To be eligible to claim a deduction for home loan interest, the claimant must have legal ownership in the dwelling.  In D108/02 18 IRBRD 45, the Board held that the word 'owner' under section 26E does not include a beneficial owner.  Similarly, in D11/06 21 IRBRD 227, the Board, after analysing the provisions of section 26E, stated that the section is concerned  with  legal,  as  opposed  to  beneficial,  ownership  in  properties.    In D94/01 16 IRBRD 792, the taxpayer divorced her husband and the court ordered her husband to transfer his interest in their dwelling to her but the assignment was only executed on a later date.  The Board held that the taxpayer became the sole owner only when the interest of her husband in the property was assigned to her.

## Sole owner

8. A  person  who  owns  a  dwelling  as  a  sole  owner  is,  subject  to  the maximum deduction prescribed in Schedule 3D, entitled to claim in accordance with  section  26E(2)(a)  the  whole  of  the  interest  paid  during  the  year  of assessment.

## Joint tenants

9. If a dwelling is held by joint tenants, the home loan interest shall be regarded as having been paid under section 26E(2)(b)(i) by the joint tenants each in proportion to the number of the joint tenants (i.e. the home loan interest paid is deemed to have been paid by each of the joint tenants equally).  In D20/01 16 IRBRD 187, the Board held that the taxpayer's  entitlement  to  the  maximum amount of deduction specified in Schedule 3D was reduced in proportion to the number of joint  tenants  and  not  according  to  the  beneficial  interests  of  joint tenants or otherwise.  It is not necessary to establish whether the joint tenants have contributed equally to the interest payments because this is not a relevant

consideration.  Provided the interest has been paid by each of the joint tenants, it is sufficient for each of the joint tenants to claim interest in proportion to the number of joint tenants.

## Example 4

Mr. D and his spouse were the joint owners of a dwelling that was used exclusively as their  place  of  residence  throughout  the  year  of assessment 2018/19.  Total mortgage interest paid by them during the year amounted to $120,000.

Mr. D and his spouse, as joint tenants, were each entitled to claim a deduction  for  home  loan  interest.    Since  they  were  joint  tenants, interest  of  $60,000  (i.e.  $120,000  ÷  2)  was  deemed  under  section 26E(2)(b)(i)  to  have  been  paid  by  each  of  them.    The  maximum deduction specified in Schedule 3D would be reduced in proportion to the number of the joint tenants (i.e. the $100,000 maximum home loan interest deduction would apply on a 'per property' basis and not on a 'per person' basis).  The maximum deduction allowed to each of them should be restricted to $50,000 (i.e. $100,000 ÷ 2).

## Tenants in common

10. If a dwelling is held by tenants in common, the interest paid by each of the tenants in common is deemed under section 26E(2)(b)(ii) to have been paid  by  the  tenants  in  common  each  in  proportion  to  his  or  her  share  in  the ownership in the dwelling.  It is not necessary to establish whether the tenants in common have contributed to the interest payments in proportion to his or her share in the ownership because this is not a relevant consideration.  Provided the interest has been paid by each of the tenants in common, it is sufficient for each of the tenants in common to claim their respective portions.

## Example 5

Mr.  E  and  Mr.  F  were  tenants  in  common  in  a  dwelling  used exclusively as their place of residence.  Their respective ownership shares were 1/4 and 3/4.  The acquisition of the dwelling was financed

by a bank mortgage and the total interest paid by them during the year of assessment 2018/19 was $120,000.

Since Mr. E and Mr. F were tenants in common, section 26E(2)(b)(ii) would deem 1/4 of the interest (i.e. $120,000 × 1/4 = $30,000) to have been  paid  by  Mr.  E  and  3/4  of  the  interest  (i.e.  $120,000 × 3/4  = $90,000) to have been paid by Mr F.   The total interest allowable to Mr.  E  and  Mr.  F  would  be  capped  at  $100,000.      The  respective amounts of home loan interest allowable to Mr. E and Mr. F should be $25,000 and $75,000 respectively.

11. As  regards  the  application  of  section  26E,  the  following  points  in relation to ownership of properties should be noted:
2. (a) Residential property owned by a limited company in which the person, who lives therein, is a shareholder does not qualify for the deduction because the person is only a tenant in a property owned by a third party.  The dwelling must be legally owned and used by the person as the person's place of residence.
3. (b) Where  the  beneficial  ownership  or  part  of  the  beneficial ownership in a dwelling passes, whether by operation of a will or under the Intestates' Estates Ordinance (Cap. 73), to a person (other than a joint tenant of the dwelling) because of the death of the legal owner, a deduction cannot be claimed for any home loan  interest  paid  by  either  the  administrator/executor  of  the estate or the person.  The deduction for the home loan interest can only be claimed after the formal transfer of the title to the person.
4. (c) Under  the  rules  of  survivorship,  the  ownership  of  a  jointly owned property passes to the other joint tenants at the time of death of the deceased.  The interest paid by the surviving joint tenants from that time onwards is deductible.
5. (d) Where  the  purchase  consideration  of  a  dwelling  is  paid  by instalments  with  interest  and  the  dwelling  is  occupied  by  a person as a licensee before the property is assigned to the person,

deduction for home loan interest cannot be claimed as the person is not the legal or registered owner of the property before the conveyance is executed.  See D3/10 25 IRBRD 162 and D11/07 22 IRBRD 300.

## Maximum interest deduction

12. The maximum deduction applies to the dwelling as a whole and not to each of the individual owners.  The maximum deduction allowable, as specified in Schedule 3D, is or is reduced as follows:

| Type of Ownership   | Maximum Deduction                                                                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sole owner          | Full deduction, as per section 26E(2)(a)(ii), to the sole owner                                                    |
| Joint tenants       | Reduced deduction, as per section 26E(2)(c)(i), on the basis of the number of joint tenants                        |
| Tenants in common   | Reduced deduction, as per section 26E(2)(c)(ii), on the basis of individual share of ownership as tenant in common |

## Example 6

| Type of Ownership           | Interest/ Share of Interest   | Allowable Deduction   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Sole owner - Example 3      |                               |                       |
| Mr. C                       | $120,000                      | $100,000              |
| Joint tenants - Example 4   |                               |                       |
| Mr. D                       | 60,000                        | 50,000                |
| Mrs. D                      | 60,000                        | 50,000                |
|                             | $120,000                      | $100,000              |
| Tenants in common - Example | 5                             |                       |
| Mr. E                       | 30,000                        | 25,000                |
| Mr. F                       | 90,000                        | 75,000                |
|                             | $120,000                      | $100,000              |

## Dwelling as a place of residence

## Actually used as a place of residence

13. The dwelling in respect of which the interest is paid must have been used by the person wholly or partly as a place of residence during the period in which the payment was made.  Properties under construction without the issue of an occupation permit or certificate of compliance cannot be used as a place of residence.  See D63/05 20 IRBRD 908.  The earliest date on which a property can become a person's place of residence is the date on which the occupation permit  or  certificate  of  compliance  is  issued.    The  date  on  which  a  property becomes a person's place of residence is, however, a matter of fact and will principally be determined by the date on which the person begins to reside in the premises.  Interest paid subsequent to the issue of the occupation permit but prior to the person taking up actual residence cannot be claimed as home loan interest because the property has not yet become the person's place of residence.

## Example 7

On  1  December  2018,  Mr.  G  obtained  a  mortgage  to  finance  the acquisition cost of a property under construction.  He paid $80,000 in interest  between  1  December  2018  and  31  March  2019.    The occupation permit of the property was issued on 1 March 2019 and the property was assigned to Mr. G on 31 March 2019.  Mr. G took up residence on 1 April 2019.

No home loan interest deduction would be allowable for the interest paid  up  to  31  March  2019  because  at  no  time  during  the  year  of assessment 2018/19 was the property used by Mr. G as his place of residence.    Interest  paid  from  1  April  2019  would  qualify  for  the deduction.

## Partly used as a place of residence

14. The full amount of the interest paid by a person on a home loan is, subject  to  the  statutory  limit,  only  deductible  when  the  dwelling  is  used exclusively by the person as a place of residence for the whole year.  In any other situation,  a  deduction  is  only  allowed  under  section  26E(2)(a)(i)(B)  for  an

amount that is reasonable in the circumstances.  For example, if a person lets out one half of the person's dwelling for the whole year of assessment, only one half of the interest expense would be allowable as a deduction under section 26E.  If the rental income received is assessable to property tax, the interest attributable to the rental income would be deductible under personal assessment.

## Example 8

Miss H was the sole owner of her dwelling which was financed by a bank mortgage.  She let out half of the property during the whole of the  year  of  assessment  2018/19.    In  the  same  period,  she  paid $120,000 in mortgage interest.

Interest of $60,000 (i.e. $120,000 ÷ 2) would be allowed to Miss H as home loan interest under section 26E.  Interest of $60,000, if having been incurred in the production of rental income, would be allowed for deduction under personal assessment, if applicable.

## Wholly used as a place of residence for part year

15. The maximum deduction for the home loan interest is not apportioned on a time basis.  A person does not need to own a place of residence for the full year to be entitled to the maximum deduction.  If the person only owned and used the dwelling as a place of residence for part of the year but, nevertheless, paid interest in excess of the amount prescribed in Schedule 3D, a deduction would be granted for the full amount paid, but not in excess of the maximum allowable deduction.

## Example 9

Ms. I paid home loan interest of $80,000 between 1 April 2018 and 31 December 2018.  She sold her flat on 31 December 2018.

Home  loan  interest  of  $80,000  paid  would  be  fully  allowed  for deduction for the year of assessment 2018/19.

## Example 10

Until 30 June 2018, Mr. J resided in accommodation provided by his employer.  On 1 July 2018, he purchased a flat and occupied it as his place of residence.  From 1 July 2018 to 31 March 2019, he paid home loan interest of $150,000.

Mr. J would be allowed deduction of $100,000 as home loan interest for the year of assessment 2018/19.

## Example 11

Between 1 April 2018 and 30 June 2018, Ms. K lived in a dwelling acquired in 2010.  She paid $30,000 in interest on her home loan.  On 1 July 2018, she sold the dwelling.  Until 30 September 2018, Ms. K lived in rented accommodation.  On 1 October 2018 she commenced to  reside  in  a  newly  built  flat.    Ms.  K  paid  $60,000  in  home  loan interest from 1 October 2018 to 31 March 2019.

Home loan  interest  of  $90,000  (i.e.  $30,000  +  $60,000)  would  be allowed for deduction for the year of assessment 2018/19.

## Change of place of residence

16. The term 'place of residence' is defined in section 26E(9).  In relation to a person who has more than one residence, it means the person's principal place of residence.  It is not unusual for a person to change homes in the course of a year of assessment by selling one home and purchasing another.  Therefore, at  different  times  within  the  same  year  of  assessment,  a  person  may  have different principal places of residence.  Home loan interest paid in respect of each principal place of residence of the person is deductible under section 26E.  It is not possible for a person to have more than one principal place of residence at the same time.  Where the periods of ownership of two properties overlap and the person is paying interest on two properties at the same time, the interest paid on the respective properties is only deductible for the respective periods when they  were  used  as  the  person's  principal  place  of  residence.    The  facts  of individual cases will determine the date on which a property ceased to be the

principal place of residence and the other property became the principal place of residence.

## Example 12

Between 1 April 2018 and 30 June 2018, Mr. L lived in a flat that he acquired in 2010.  On 1 July 2018, he moved into a newly completed flat  but  was  unable to sell his former residence until 30 September 2018.   He paid $7,000 per month in interest on his former residence during the period from 1 April 2018 to 30 September 2018 and further $72,000 in interest on the loan for his new residence from 1 July 2018 to 31 March 2019.

If the newly acquired property became the principal place of residence on 1 July 2018, Mr. L would only be entitled to claim interest paid on his  former  residence  up  to  30  June  2018.      His  home  loan  interest deduction for the year of assessment 2018/19 would be $93,000 (i.e. $7,000 × 3 + $72,000).

## Principal place of residence

## Matter of fact and degree

17. A home loan interest deduction is only allowable for interest paid in respect of a person's principal place of residence.  In D108/02 18 IRBRD 45, the Board stated that although merely sleeping on the premises was not conclusive of residence, the residence of a person was by implication that person's home, where at  least  the  person  had  a  sleeping  apartment  or  shared  one.    The  question  of whether a dwelling is a person's place of residence is essentially one of fact and degree.  Other than the situation of a person moving residences, a person may own more than one property used as a residence during a year of assessment (e.g. a flat located in the urban area and a house on an outlying island).  At different, mutually exclusive,  periods  within  the  year  of  assessment,  the  person  could  use  the dwellings as the principal place of residence.  The home loan interest deduction would be allowed for each property for the respective period that the relevant property was used as the person's principal place of residence.  It is not accepted that a person could, at frequent and regular intervals, alternate two properties as a principal place of residence (e.g. by claiming an urban property to be a principal

place of residence on weekdays and the house on the outlying island as a principal place of residence on weekends).

18. In cases of owning more than one place of residence, the home in which a person and the person's family spend the majority of their time will invariably be taken  as  the  principal  place  of  residence.    Any  dwelling  used  as  a  residence predominantly at weekends and for holidays would, in all but the most exceptional circumstances,  be  regarded  as  a  holiday  home.    Holiday  homes  and  the  like, notwithstanding that they may be used as a place of residence, are unlikely the principal place of residence.  As a consequence, a person who may have fully repaid a loan obtained to finance the acquisition of the principal place of residence but still has an outstanding mortgage on another home (i.e. secondary home), cannot be allowed a deduction for home loan interest because the secondary home does not satisfy the 'principal place of residence' requirement.

## Employer-provided accommodation

19. An employee may be required to occupy staff quarters at a prescribed location for operational reasons related to employment (e.g. staff of government departments).  At the same time, the employee's spouse and family members continue to reside in another property as the family home, in which the employee lives  when  the  employee  is  not  required  to  reside  in  the  employer-provided quarters  for  operational  reasons.    Under  such  or  similar  circumstances,  the employee's  family  home,  and  not  the  employer-provided  quarters,  is  the employee's principal place of residence.

## Married couple's principal place of residence

20. 'Marriage' is defined in section 2(1) of the IRO to mean:
2. (a) any marriage recognized by the law of Hong Kong; or
3. (b) any marriage, whether or not so recognized, entered into outside Hong  Kong  according  to  the  law  of  the  place  where  it  was entered into and between persons having the capacity to do so.

The definition of 'marriage' shall not, in the case of a marriage which is both potentially and actually polygamous, include marriage between a person and any

spouse other than the  principal  spouse.    If  a  person  has  more  than  one  legal spouse under the laws of other places which permit polygamous marriage, only the marriage between the person and the principal spouse is recognized for the purposes of the IRO.

21. In section 2(1) of the IRO, 'spouse' is defined to mean a husband or wife whereas 'husband' and 'wife' refer to a married man and married woman respectively.    Based  on  the  above  definitions,  'marriage'  was  in  the  past construed as a heterosexual marriage between a man and a woman and parties in a same-sex marriage would be incapable of having a 'spouse'.
22. In Leung Chun Kwong v Secretary for the Civil Service (2019) 22 HKCFAR 127, the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) recognized that the protection of the institution of marriage in Hong  Kong, being heterosexual and monogamous, was a legitimate aim.  However, the differential treatment under the IRO between a person in a heterosexual marriage and a person in a same-sex marriage entered into outside Hong Kong was not rationally connected to the legitimate  aim  and  was  not  justified.    As  a  relief,  the  CFA  considered  that  a remedial interpretation of the IRO was appropriate and ordered the following declaration:
3. (a) the existing limb (b) of the term 'marriage' in section 2 of the IRO  shall  be  read  as  'any  marriage,  whether  or  not  so recognized, entered into outside Hong Kong according to the law of the place where it was entered into and between persons having the capacity to do so, provided where the persons are of the  same  sex  and  such  a  marriage  between  them  would  have been a marriage under this Ordinance but for the fact only that they are persons of the same sex, they shall be deemed for the purposes of such a marriage to have the capacity to do so'; and
4. (b) for the purposes of the IRO, references to:
5. (i) 'husband and wife' shall be read as 'a married person and his or her spouse';
6. (ii) 'not being a wife living apart from her husband' shall be read as 'not being a spouse living apart from the married person'; and

- (iii) 'either the husband or wife' shall be read as 'either the married person or his or her spouse'.
23. A married couple, whether in a heterosexual marriage or same-sex marriage, who are not living apart from each other, should always have the same principal place of residence.   The married couple cannot claim that two different homes  concurrently  owned  by  each  of  them  are  both  principal  places  of residence.  They are not entitled to home loan interest deductions in respect of different properties which they own separately.  The facts of individual cases will determine which dwelling is the principal place of residence of the married couple and the interest paid on that dwelling will be deductible to its owner.   The other spouse will not be entitled to any deduction for home loan interest for the same period.

## Place of residence for year of marriage and separation/divorce

24. A married couple may be separated in circumstances such that divorce proceedings are either in progress or likely to be instituted within a reasonable time.  In such situations, the married couple are likely to be living apart from each other and will have different principal places of residence.  Each may be allowed a deduction for home loan interest in respect of the interest attributable to their respective principal places of residence subsequent to the date of their separation or divorce.
25. In a year of marriage, separation or divorce, the married couple may each claim a deduction in respect of different principal places of residence used at different times in the same year of assessment.  The respective periods within that year when a person concerned is single, married or living apart from the spouse are treated separately when determining the entitlement to the deduction.  A person living  in  the  person's  own  home  before  marriage  and  moving  to  the  spouse's residence upon marriage is entitled to a deduction for home loan interest up to the day immediately before the person moves to the spouse's residence, subject to the maximum interest deduction.

## Example 13

Mr. M married Ms. N on 1 July 2018.  Prior to their marriage, Mr. M resided in a flat owned by him as a tenant in common with two other persons.  The flat was purchased in 2010 and Mr. M's share in the ownership was 1/3.  Ms. N lived in rented accommodation.  After their marriage,  both  Mr.  M  and  Ms.  N  resided  in  Ms.  N's  flat  until  31 December 2018.  On 1 January 2019, Mr. M and Ms. N started to live in a dwelling that they acquired in September 2018 as joint tenants. Mr. M's share of the interest paid on his former residence between 1 April 2018 and 30 June 2018 was $30,000.  The interest paid by Mr. M  and  Ms.  N  between  1  January  2019  and  31  March  2019  was $90,000 (i.e. $45,000 each).

For  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19,  Mr.  M  would  be  entitled  to  a deduction  of  $75,000  ($30,000  +  $45,000)  and  Ms.  N  would  be entitled to a deduction of $45,000.

## Example 14

Mr. O married Ms. P on 1 July 2018.  Prior to their marriage, Mr. O and Ms. P were each the sole owner of their residences purchased in 2015 and 2016 respectively.  Upon marriage, Ms. P moved into Mr. O's residence.  The flat, however, remained registered in the name of Mr. O as sole owner.  Between 1 April 2018 and 30 June 2018, Mr. O paid $60,000 in home loan interest and Ms. P paid $90,000 in home loan interest.  Between 1 July 2018 and 31 March 2019, Mr. O paid a further $180,000 in home loan interest.

For the year of assessment 2018/19, Mr. O would be entitled to a home loan interest deduction of $100,000 and Ms. P would be entitled to a deduction of $90,000.

26. The tax treatment in relation to the year of marriage applies equally to a year of separation or divorce.  Whilst the dates of marriage and divorce are a matter  of  record,  the  date  of  separation  (which  is  the  more  relevant  date  for determining the date when a married couple began living apart from each other) will need to be determined from the facts on a case by case basis.  Of necessity,

the onus must rest with the taxpayers concerned to provide adequate evidence of the date of separation.

## Example 15

Mr. Q and Mrs. Q lived together in their jointly owned residence until 30 September 2018.  On 1 October 2018, they separated and Mr. Q moved to rented accommodation.  Under the Deed of Separation, legal ownership of the home was vested in Mrs. Q on 1 October 2018.  The mortgage liability  was  taken  up  by  Mrs.  Q  on  the  same  day.    The interest paid on the mortgage up to 30 September 2018 was $80,000. Mrs. Q paid a further $80,000 in interest between 1 October 2018 and 31 March 2019 .

Mr. Q would be entitled to a deduction for the interest of $40,000 (i.e. $80,000 ÷ 2) paid by him for the year of assessment 2018/19.  Mrs. Q paid interest of $120,000 (i.e. $40,000 + $80,000) but her deduction would be limited to $100,000.

## Leaving Hong Kong for extended periods

27. Under salaries tax,  a  person  is  not  required  to  be  resident  in  Hong Kong  before  he  is  entitled  to  claim  concessionary  deductions  and  personal allowances.    Nevertheless,  the  home  loan  interest  deduction  would  not  be allowable  to  a  person  who  has  left  Hong  Kong  on  a  permanent  basis  (e.g. emigration  to  establish  a  home  elsewhere).    Subsequent  to  emigration,  the dwelling located in Hong Kong will no longer be the person's principal place of residence.    Situations  will  arise  where  a  person  leaves  Hong  Kong  for  an extended period.  These include employment-related overseas postings where the person  will  return  to  Hong  Kong  at  the  end  of  the  posting  even  though  the overseas posting is for an extended period.  If the dwelling in Hong Kong is retained as a residence with the intention that it would continue to be used as a residence upon the person's return to Hong Kong, it would be regarded as the person's principal place of residence.

## Rateable unit

28. To  qualify  for  the  deduction,  the  dwelling  must  be  subject  to  the Rating Ordinance.  The Rating Ordinance only applies to buildings located in Hong Kong and the deduction is therefore only available in respect of dwellings situated in Hong Kong.  In addition to defining a 'dwelling' as being a building or part of a building designed and constructed for use exclusively or partly for residential  purpose  (i.e.  industrial  and  commercial  buildings  excluded),  the dwelling  must  have  its  rateable  value  separately  estimated  under  the  Rating Ordinance.  Areas within dwellings that are not rated on a stand-alone basis (e.g. rooms  located  within)  cannot,  in  their  own  right,  satisfy  the  definition  of dwelling.

## Home loan

29. Under section 26E(9), a home loan means a loan of money that is applied wholly or partly for the purchase of a dwelling used at any time in the year of assessment as the person's place of residence.  If the home loan was applied wholly and exclusively for financing the purchase of the residence, then all of the interest paid would qualify as home loan interest.  Where the loan is not applied solely for the acquisition of the residence, section 26E(3)(a) provides that the deduction allowable to the person should be such part of the amount of the home loan interest paid as is reasonable in the circumstances of the case.  As a  general  rule,  when  a  loan  has  not  been  wholly  applied  for  financing  the acquisition of the residence, the deductible portion of the interest paid would be calculated by apportioning the total interest paid in the same ratio as that in which the funds were applied to qualifying and non-qualifying purposes.  If, however, a person is able to satisfy the Commissioner that this apportionment basis is not equitable  in  his  or  her  particular  circumstances,  the  Commissioner  would consider an alternative basis proposed by the person.  The onus of establishing that the alternative basis proposed is more equitable remains with the person.

## Example 16

Mr. R purchased a dwelling exclusively used as his place of residence on 1 April 2018.  A mortgage loan of $4,000,000 was obtained and $2,000,000 put towards the purchase of the dwelling.  The remaining

$2,000,000 was on-lent to another person.  The total interest paid in the year ended 31 March 2019 was $100,000.

As only one half of the loan was applied for financing the purchase of the dwelling, the home loan interest deduction to Mr. R for the year of assessment 2018/19 would be restricted to 1/2 of the total interest paid (i.e. $50,000).   In future years of assessment, the interest attributable to  the  loan  on-lent  to  other  person  would  not  be  deductible  and apportionment of interest deduction would be required.

30. Notwithstanding that a loan may originally have been obtained for the purchase of a dwelling (i.e. for qualifying purpose), any subsequent re-grant of the loan or increase in the principal amount that is not applied for a qualifying purpose cannot be regarded as a home loan.  The application of the additional funds obtained for a qualifying purpose (i.e. to repay the original home loan) will be the sole determinant of deductibility of the interest paid on the loan re-granted. Where a home loan is re-drawn subsequent to repayment of all or part of the original loan, or an extension of the original loan amount is obtained, and the funds are applied for non-qualifying purposes, no deduction is allowable for the interest paid on that part of the loan applied for non-qualifying purposes.

## Example 17

Ms. S wholly owns a dwelling which was exclusively used as her place of residence throughout the year of assessment 2018/19.  The dwelling was acquired in 2006 by a mortgage loan which was fully repaid in 2017/18.  On 1 April 2018, Ms. S mortgaged the dwelling again to obtain a loan and applied the proceeds to purchase quoted shares.  In the  year  ended  31  March  2019,  the  interest  paid  on  the  loan  was $100,000.

The  funds  obtained  on  1  April  2018  were  not  applied  for  the acquisition  of  Ms.  S's  dwelling.    The  interest  paid  would  not  be deductible as home loan interest.

31. However, if a re-mortgaged loan is partly used to repay the original loan which was obtained for the purchase of a dwelling, the portion of the interest paid, in proportion to the outstanding balance of the original loan, is deductible.

## Example 18

- Mr. T obtained a mortgage loan of $4,000,000 for the purchase of a dwelling which was exclusively used as his place of residence.  On 1 April 2018, Mr. T obtained a new mortgage loan of $2,000,000 and used part of it to repay the outstanding balance of $800,000 of the original  loan.    Mr.  T  continued  to  reside  in  the  dwelling  and  paid interest of $50,000 for the year of assessment 2018/19.
- Mr. T would be entitled to a home loan interest deduction of $20,000 (i.e.  $50,000 × $800,000 ÷ $2,000,000) for  the  year  of  assessment 2018/19.
32. Under  the  Government  Home  Ownership  Scheme,  a  person  may purchase a dwelling at a price below market value but subject to a restriction on alienation.  The restriction on alienation can be removed by paying a premium to the Housing Authority.  A loan obtained to pay the premium is not applied for the acquisition of the dwelling but for the purpose of removing the restriction on alienation.  The loan, hence, is not a home loan and the interest paid under the loan cannot be deducted.  See D2/01 16 IRBRD 121.
33. Any home loan must be secured by a mortgage or a legal charge over a property in Hong Kong.  If the lender does not have a mortgage or a legal charge over a property in Hong Kong, the borrower is not entitled to a deduction for the interest.  If a mortgage or legal charge is only registered at some time after the granting of the loan, only interest paid from the date of registration of the mortgage or charge is deductible.
34. The  home  loan  interest  deduction  is  not  confined  to  interest attributable to one home loan only.  When a person obtains a down-payment loan from one source, say his or her employer in addition to a loan from a bank, provided that the down-payment loan is secured by a charge or mortgage over a  Hong  Kong  property,  the  interest  on  the  down-payment  loan  is  also deductible.

35. Banks and financial institutions may levy charges for late payment of instalment or early repayment of the loan.  These charges are not interest and cannot be deducted under section 26E.

## Entitlement years for deduction

36. A  person  can  be  allowed  a  deduction  for  home  loan  interest  for  a prescribed  number  of  entitlement  years.    Section  26E(4)(c)  allows  the  years  of assessment in which the deduction is granted not to be in consecutive years.   The maximum year of entitlement was five years initially, and lengthened to seven years since the year of assessment 2003/04, and extended to 10 years since the year  of  assessment  2005/06.    The  entitlement  years  for  deduction  had  been extended to any 15 years of assessment since the year of assessment 2012/13 under the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Ordinance 2012.  After the enactment of  the  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  Ordinance  2017,  since  the  year  of assessment  2017/18,  the  entitlement  years  for  deduction  have  been  further extended to any 20 years of assessment.  The extensions of entitlement years for home loan interest deduction under the two amendment ordinances only apply to prospective years of assessment and do not apply to the years of assessment prior  to  the  enactment  of  these  amendment  ordinances.    Section  26E(4)(d) provides that for those persons who cannot be allowed home loan interest in a year of assessment due to exhaustion of entitlement years in accordance with the prevailing law, they are not entitled to home loan interest deduction for that year of  assessment  notwithstanding  the  extension  of  the  entitlement  years  in  the subsequent years.
37. Subject to the provisions for revocation of a claim for the deduction, once a deduction for any amount of home loan interest has been taken into account in a year  of  assessment  in  determining  a  person's  net  chargeable  income  or  income chargeable to tax under personal assessment, the person shall be deemed to have been  allowed  the  deduction  for  that  year  of  assessment,  which  will  be  counted against the person's entitlement years.

## Car parking spaces

38. The home loan interest deduction also applies in relation to interest incurred on the acquisition of car parking spaces.  Provided that the home loan obtained in respect of a dwelling was applied also for the acquisition of the car

parking spaces, these car parking spaces are deemed under section 26E(8) to be part and parcel of the dwelling and used in the same manner and to the same extent by a person as the residence itself is used as the person's dwelling.

## Revocation of claims

39. The Commissioner will notify each claimant that the deduction for home loan interest has been allowed if the home loan interest has been taken into account in determining the net chargeable income of the claimant.  For the person who is issued a notice of assessment, the issue date of the notice of assessment will be the date on which notification of allowance of the deduction is given.  For any person whose income is not subject to tax, a written notice of allowance of the deduction will be given.  A person may withdraw his or her claim for home loan interest deduction under section 26E(6).  According to section 26E(6)(a), written notice of revocation of the deduction must be given by the person within six months after the date on which the deduction was allowed.  The six-month period  for  revocation  begins  to  run  from  the  date  of  the  notification  that  the deduction has been allowed.  If a person revokes his or her claim after six years from the expiration of the year of assessment to which the claim relates, section 26E(6A) empowers the assessor to make additional assessment, within two years after such revocation.
40. Section 26E(6)(b) provides that when a claim for home loan interest deduction is revoked, the claim is deemed not to have been made.  The year of assessment to which the revocation relates will not count as one of the years of assessment in which the person had claimed the deduction for home loan interest.

## Specified bodies and recognized organizations or associations

41. Only interest paid to specified bodies and recognized organizations or associations as set out in section 26E(9) could be allowed as a deduction for home loan interest.  Specified bodies are the Government, financial institutions (i.e.  defined  as  authorized  institutions  within  the  meaning of  section 2 of  the Banking  Ordinance  or  associates  of  such  authorized  institutions),  registered credit unions, licensed money lenders, the Hong Kong Housing Society and a person's employer.  Recognized organizations or associations are organizations or associations recognized by the Commissioner.

42. The  Commissioner  may  approve  an  organization  as  a  recognized organization or association for the purposes of the home loan interest deduction under section 26E(7).  The basic criterion for approval of an organization or association which does not fall within the six prescribed categories of bodies is that the loan arrangements made by the organization and the borrowers must be on an arm's length basis.  Any organization or association in which a person or the person's family or relatives (or those of the person's spouse) hold any direct or  indirect  financial  interest  is  unlikely  to  be  approved  unless  in  the  most exceptional circumstances. Applications for approval as a recognized organization or association should be directed to:

Assistant Commissioner, Unit 2 Inland Revenue Department G.P.O. Box 132 Hong Kong

43. Any  person  wishing  to  know  whether  a  specific  organization  or association has been approved as a lender for the purposes of section 26E(9) may make enquiries directly with his or her assessor.  In the enquiry, the full name and address of the lender must be provided.

## Property transfers intended to obtain a tax benefit

44. The anti-avoidance provisions of section 61A empower the Commissioner to disregard or reconstruct transactions that are entered into for the sole or dominant purpose of enabling a person to obtain a tax benefit, having regard to the seven matters specified in section 61A(1).  Transactions involving the transfer of ownership or partial ownership of property between spouses for a consideration financed by borrowed funds will be subject to detailed examination.  Where it is concluded that the sole or predominant purpose for the transfer of the property is to obtain a tax benefit, the deduction for home loan interest will be denied.

## NOMINATION OF SPOUSE TO CLAIM DEDUCTION

## General rules for nomination

45. A person may be entitled to a deduction for home loan interest under section 26E but have no income chargeable to tax against which to claim the deduction.   To cater for such situations, section 26F(1) allows a person without income to nominate the person's spouse to claim the deduction to which the person is entitled.  Section 26F(2)(a) provides that when a spouse is nominated to claim the deduction for a particular year of assessment, the person making the nomination  forgoes  his  or  her  entitlement  to  the  deduction  in  favour  of  the nominated spouse who may claim it.   If a person has more than one legal spouse under  the  laws  of  other  places  which  permit  polygamous  marriage,  only  the nomination made by the principal spouse will be accepted.  Nominations for a spouse to claim a person's entitlement to home loan interest must be made on a year by year basis.  According to section 26F(2)(b), if a nomination was made and  allowed,  the  person  making  the  nomination  is  regarded  as  having  been allowed the deduction under section 26E for that year of assessment.

## Revocation of nomination

46. Upon allowing the deduction for home loan interest to the nominated spouse, the Commissioner will give written notification to the person making the nomination  that  the  deduction  has  been  allowed  under  section  26F(3).    A nomination for a spouse to claim a deduction may be revoked by the person who made it within six months after the date of the notification by the Commissioner that the deduction has been allowed.  Once a nomination has been revoked, it is deemed under section 26F(4)(b) that the claim for home loan interest deduction has not been made and the number of remaining years of entitlement to the home loan interest deduction for the person revoking the deduction is restored to its position prior to the nomination being made for that year.

## PROCESSING DEDUCTION CLAIM

## Illustrative examples

## Salaries tax

47. If  a  person's  income  from  employment  exceeds  the  aggregate  of personal allowances and total deductions (including home  loan interest deduction) for a year, the person will be issued a notice of salaries tax assessment with home loan interest deduction allowed and the person is deemed to have claimed the deduction for the year.

## Example 19

For  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19,  Mr.  U  had  salary  income  of $300,000.  He claimed home loan interest deduction of $100,000 in respect of his solely owned property.

|                       |                              | $       | $       |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|---------|---------|
| Salary income         | Salary income                |         | 300,000 |
| Less:                 | Home loan interest deduction | 100,000 |         |
|                       | Basic allowance              | 132,000 | 232,000 |
| Net chargeable income | Net chargeable income        |         | 68,000  |

In  the  notice  of  salaries  tax  assessment  issued,  Mr.  U  would  be advised of the home loan interest deduction allowed for the year of assessment 2018/19.

48. If a person's income  from  employment  exceeds  the  personal allowances and deductions other than home loan interest deduction but is less than  the  aggregate  of  allowances  and  total  deductions  (including  home  loan interest deduction) for a year, the person will not be issued any notice of salaries tax assessment but the person is deemed to have claimed the deduction for the year.

## Example 20

In  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19,  Mr.  V  had  salary  income  of $160,000.  He claimed home loan interest deduction of $50,000 in

respect  of  his  solely  owned  property  and  approved  charitable donations of $10,000.

|                       |                               | $       | $       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|---------|---------|
| Salary income         | Salary income                 |         | 160,000 |
| Less:                 | Approved charitable donations | 10,000  |         |
|                       | Home loan interest deduction  | 50,000  |         |
|                       | Basic allowance               | 132,000 | 192,000 |
| Net chargeable income | Net chargeable income         |         | 0       |

No notice of salaries tax assessment would be issued to Mr. V but the deduction  for  home  loan  interest  would  be  deemed  to  have  been allowed to Mr. V.  The excess of Mr. V's deductions and allowances over  his  income  could  not  be  carried  forward  to  future  years  of assessment.  Mr. V would be advised that the home loan interest had been deducted in arriving at his net chargeable income (which was equal to nil) for the year of assessment 2018/19.

49. If a person's income  from  employment  is  less  than  personal allowances for a year, no notice of salaries tax assessment will be issued and the person is not regarded as having claimed home loan interest deduction for the year.

## Example 21

In the year of assessment 2018/19, Miss W, who was unmarried, had salary income of $90,000.  She claimed home loan interest deduction of $20,000 in respect of her solely owned property.

|                       |                              | $       | $       |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|---------|---------|
| Salary income         | Salary income                |         | 90,000  |
| Less:                 | Home loan interest deduction | 20,000  |         |
|                       | Basic allowance              | 132,000 | 152,000 |
| Net chargeable income | Net chargeable income        |         | 0       |

Miss W's income was less than her personal allowance.  She would not be charged to salaries tax even without deducting any home loan interest.    Miss  W  would not be regarded as having been allowed a home loan interest deduction for the year of assessment 2018/19.

50. For a married couple, if the income from employment of each spouse exceeds the aggregate of the spouse's personal allowances and total deductions (including home loan interest deduction) for a year, each spouse will be issued a notice of salaries tax assessment with home loan interest deduction allowed and the married couple are deemed to have claimed the deduction for the year.

## Example 22

In  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19,  Mr.  X  and  Mrs.  X  had  salary income of $300,000 and $200,000 respectively.   Each of them claimed home loan interest  deduction  of  $80,000  in  respect  of  their  jointly owned property.

|                        |                              | Mr. X Mrs.   | Mr. X Mrs.   | X       | X       |
|------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| Income from employment | Income from employment       |              | 300,000      |         | 200,000 |
| Less:                  | Home loan interest deduction | 50,000       |              | 50,000  |         |
|                        | Basic allowance              | 132,000      | 182,000      | 132,000 | 182,000 |
| Net chargeable income  | Net chargeable income        |              | 118,000      |         | 18,000  |

Home loan interest deductions given respectively to Mr. X and Mrs. X would be restricted to the reduced maximum deduction.   Each of them would be issued a notice of salaries tax assessment showing their net chargeable incomes.   Mr. X and Mrs. X would be advised of the home loan interest deduction allowed for the year of assessment 2018/19.

51. For joint assessment, if a spouse is not liable to salaries tax (i.e. the spouse's  income  from  employment  is  less  than  the  aggregate  of  personal allowances and total deductions, including home loan interest deduction), the other  spouse  liable  to  salaries  tax  will  be  issued  a  notice  of  salaries  tax assessment with home loan interest deduction.  The spouse not liable to salaries tax will not be issued any notice of salaries tax assessment but is deemed to have claimed the deduction for the year.

## Example 23

In  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19,  Mr.  Y  and  Mrs.  Y  had  salary income of $500,000 and $140,000 respectively.    Mrs. Y claimed home

loan  interest  deduction  of  $70,000  in  respect  of  her  solely  owned property.  Mr. Y and Mrs. Y elected under section 10(2) to be jointly assessed for salaries tax.

|                                    | $       | $       |
|------------------------------------|---------|---------|
| Salary income of Mr. Y             |         | 500,000 |
| Salary income of Mrs. Y            |         | 140,000 |
| Aggregated assessable income       |         | 640,000 |
| Less: Home loan interest deduction | 70,000  |         |
| Married person's allowance         | 264,000 | 334,000 |
| Aggregated net chargeable income   |         | 306,000 |

Mr. Y would be issued a notice of salaries tax assessment but Mrs. Y would not be issued any notice of salaries tax assessment.  Deduction for home loan interest would be deemed to have been allowed to Mrs. Y as the home loan interest was deducted in arriving at the aggregated net chargeable income of Mr. Y and Mrs. Y under salaries tax.   Mrs. Y would be advised of the home loan interest deduction allowed for the year of assessment 2018/19.

## Personal assessment

52. If the total income of a person, who elects for personal assessment, exceeds the aggregate of personal allowances and total deductions (including home loan interest), the person will be issued a notice of personal assessment with home loan interest deduction allowed and the person is deemed to have claimed the deduction for the year.

## Example 24

In  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19, Mr. Z had assessable profits of $300,000.    He  elected  for  personal  assessment,  and  claimed  home loan  interest  deduction  of  $180,000  in  respect  of  his  solely  owned property.

|                       |                       | $       | $       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------|---------|
| Assessable profits    | Assessable profits    |         | 300,000 |
| Less:                 | Home loan interest    | 100,000 |         |
|                       | Basic allowance       | 132,000 | 232,000 |
| Net chargeable income | Net chargeable income |         | 68,000  |

Home loan interest deduction allowed to Mr. Z would be restricted to the  maximum  deduction  of  $100,000.      In  the  notice  of  personal assessment issued, Mr. Z would be advised of the home loan interest deduction allowed for the year of assessment 2018/19.

53. For personal assessment elected by a married couple under section 41(1A), if the married couple are liable to tax under personal assessment (i.e. the total  income  exceeds  the  total  deductions,  including  home  loan  interest deduction),  each  of  the  married  couple  will  be  issued  a  notice  of  personal assessment with home loan interest deduction allowed.  The spouse who made the home loan interest deduction claim is deemed to have claimed the deduction for the year.

## Example 25

In  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19,  Mr.  A  had  salary  income  of $300,000 while Mrs. A had assessable profits of $150,000.  Mrs. A claimed for deduction of home loan interest of $90,000 in respect of her  solely  owned  property.      They  jointly  elected  for  personal assessment under section 41(1A).

|                                  | Mr. A   | Mrs. A   | Total   |
|----------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|
| Salary income                    | 300,000 | -        | 300,000 |
| Assessable profits               | -       | 150,000  | 150,000 |
|                                  | 300,000 | 150,000  | 450,000 |

| Less: Married person's allowance |         |          | 264,000 |
| Net chargeable income            |         |          | 96,000  |

Each  of  Mr.  A  and  Mrs.  A  would  be  issued  a  notice  of  personal assessment.      Mrs.  A  would  be  advised  of  the  home  loan  interest deductions allowed for the year of assessment 2018/19.

54. For personal assessment elected by a married couple under section 41(1A), if one spouse is not liable to tax under personal assessment (i.e. the spouse's income is less than the total deductions, including home loan interest deduction, and adjusted loss from business), the other spouse liable to tax will

be  issued  a  notice  of  personal  assessment  with  home  loan  interest  deduction allowed.  The spouse not liable to tax is deemed to have claimed the deduction for the year.

## Example 26

In  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19,  Mr.  B  had  salary  income  of $340,000 while Mrs. B had property income (i.e. net assessable value) of  $50,000.    Mrs.  B  also  had  an  adjusted  loss  of  $30,000.  Mrs.  B claimed for deduction of home loan interest of $90,000 in respect of her  solely  owned  property.    Mr.  B  and  Mrs.  B  jointly  elected  for personal assessment under section 41(1A).

The excess of Mrs. B's loan interest and adjusted loss would be set off against  the  income  of  Mr.  B.    Mr.  B  would  be  issued  a  notice  of personal assessment showing his net chargeable income.  Mrs. B, who was not liable to tax, would be advised that the home loan interest deduction had been allowed for the year of assessment 2018/19.

55. For personal assessment elected by a married couple under section 41(1A), if the married couple are not liable to tax under personal assessment (i.e. the aggregated total incomes are less than the aggregate of personal allowances,

total deductions and loss) but would have been liable if the loss and home loan interest had not been deducted, the married couple will not be issued any notice of personal assessment but are deemed to have claimed the deduction for the year.

## Example 27

In  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19,  Mr.  C  had  salary  income  of $300,000 while Mrs. C had property income (i.e. net assessable value) of $50,000.  Mrs. C also had an adjusted loss of $500,000. Mrs. C claimed for deduction of home loan interest of $90,000 in respect of her solely owned property.  Mr. C and Mrs. C elected for personal assessment under section 41(1A).

Notes

(a) The excess of Mrs. C's home loan interest of $40,000 which was not used to set off against Mrs. C's income (i.e. $90,000 - $50,000) would be used to set off against Mr. C's income.

Mrs. C's home loan interest would be set off in the following orders:

| - against Mrs. C's total income                           | $50,000   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| - against Mr. C's total income under section 42(5)(a)(ii) | $40,000   |
|                                                           | $90,000   |

(b)  Mr. C's income, after deducting the balance of the home loan interest claimed by Mrs. C, would be set off by Mrs. C's loss of $500,000, but would be restricted to the net total income of Mr. C.

- (c) The balance of the loss which was not used to set off against Mr. C's income  would  be  carried  forward  for  setting  off  against  Mrs.  C's income in subsequent years of assessment.

No notice of personal assessment would be issued to Mr. C and Mrs. C but the home loan interest would be deemed to have been allowed. Mrs. C would be advised that the home loan interest had been deducted in  arriving at the total net chargeable income of Mr. C and Mrs. C (which was equal to nil).
