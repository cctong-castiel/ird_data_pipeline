## INTRODUCTION

Following  the legislative  amendments  and  a  number  of  court decisions  concerning  the  treatment  of  losses  in  recent  years,  it  is  considered appropriate  to  update  our  Practice  Notes  to  incorporate  the  new  statutory provisions and court cases, and to explain the practice adopted by the Inland Revenue  Department in ascertaining and setting off the tax losses of businesses.

## STATUTORY PROVISIONS

2. Section 19C of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (the Ordinance) deals with the treatment of losses arising from a trade, profession or business for the year of assessment 1975/76 and subsequent.
3. Section 19D states that losses are computed in the same way and for the same basis period as assessable profits for that year of assessment would have been computed. It follows, therefore, that the provisions of sections 18B and 18E apply in deciding the year of assessment in which an allowable loss arises. Further, only losses arising in Hong Kong from the carrying on of a trade,  profession  or  business  in  Hong  Kong  are  allowable  for  set  off  against assessable  profits. This  is  put  beyond  doubt  by  the  provisions  of  section 19C(6)(d).
4. Section 18F provides that depreciation allowances under Part VI are deductible in arriving at  the  amount  of  assessable  profits  of  a  person  'to  the extent to which the relevant assets are used in the production of the assessable profits'. It further provides that where the amount of depreciation allowances made under Part VI exceeds the person's assessable profits, as increased by any balancing  charge,  the  amount  of  such  excess  is  deemed  to  be  a  loss  of  that person for that year of assessment.
5. Sections 19CA and 19CB, which apply from the year of assessment 1998/99  onwards,  provide  for  the  set  off  of  unabsorbed  losses  from  normal trading receipts and concessionary trading receipts.
6. Section 20AD  stipulates that losses arising from the exempt transactions carried on by an offshore fund cannot be used to set off against its future assessable profits. Reference can be made to Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes No. 43 for the operation of the relevant rules.

## TREATMENT OF LOSSES -SECTION 19C

## Individuals

7. Section  19C(1)  provides  that  if  an  individual  sustains  a  loss  in carrying on a trade, profession or business, such loss can be carried forward for set off against his assessable profits from that same trade, etc., in subsequent years of assessment. This provision only applies where the individual has not elected  for  personal  assessment  for  the  year  of  assessment  in  which  the  loss was incurred.

## Partnerships with Individuals as partners

8. Section  19C(2)  deals  with  the  treatment  of  losses  incurred  by  a partnership  in  which  one  or  more  of  the  partners  are  individuals. Any loss incurred by such a partnership is apportioned among the partners in accordance with their profit or loss sharing arrangement during the basis period concerned (see section 22A). The amount allocated to a partner who is an individual is available  for  carry  forward  and  set  off  against  his  share  of  the  partnership profits from that same business for subsequent years of assessment. As with section 19C(1), this provision is also subject to the partner not having elected personal assessment for that year of assessment.
9. That  is  to  say,  the  losses  of  a  partnership  are  individual  to  the partners,  they  are  not  losses  of  the  partnership  and  cannot  be  set  off  against future partnership profits:

## Example 1

A, B and C are carrying on a business in partnership. A is entitled to an annual salary of $90,000 and the balance of the profits or loss is divided equally.

The partnership prepares its accounts to 31 December each year and its results are:

| Year ended 31 December 2007   | Loss    | ($120,000)   |
|-------------------------------|---------|--------------|
| Year ended 31 December 2008   | Profits | $120,000     |

The  loss  of  the  partnership  business  for  the  year  of  assessment 2007/08  (basis  period  -  year  ended  31  December  2007)  is  to  be allocated among the partners. The loss attributable to each partner is carried forward and set off against his share of partnership profits for the year of assessment 2008/09.

## Year of assessment 2007/08

| Salary   | Balance   | Sub- total   | Reallocation of A's 'surplus'   | Share of the partnership loss   |
|----------|-----------|--------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| $        | $         | $            | $                               | $                               |
| 90,000   | (70,000)  | 20,000       | (20,000)                        | -                               |
| -        | (70,000)  | (70,000)     | 10,000                          | (60,000)                        |
|          | (70,000)  | (70,000)     | 10,000                          | (60,000)                        |
| 90,000   | (210,000) | (120,000)    |                                 | (120,000)                       |

If  B  and  C  do  not  elect  for  personal  assessment,  their  share  of  the partnership loss, i.e. $60,000 each, will be carried forward for set off against  their  share  of  profits  from  the  partnership  in  subsequent years.

## Year of assessment 2008/09

| Salary   |          | Balance   | Share of Set off Share partnership partnership loss profits brought forward   | Share of partnership loss carried forward   |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| $ 90,000 | $ 10,000 | $ 100,000 | $ -                                                                           | $ -                                         |
| -        | 10,000   | 10,000    | (60,000)                                                                      | (50,000)                                    |
| -        | 10,000   | 10,000    | (60,000)                                                                      | (50,000)                                    |
| 90,000   | 30,000   | 120,000   |                                                                               | (100,000)                                   |

If A does not elect for personal assessment for the year of assessment 2008/09, profits tax is payable on the $100,000 profits apportioned to him and a notice of assessment reflecting this will be issued to the partnership  in  accordance  with  section  22(1).    If  A  elects  for

personal  assessment,  his  total  income  will  include  his  share  of  the partnership profits of $100,000.

10. Where an individual has sustained a loss or has incurred a share of loss in a partnership and has elected for personal assessment, the amount of the loss shall be dealt with under personal assessment.

## Corporations or bodies of persons

11. Sections 19C(4) and (5) apply to a corporation or 'a person who is not  an  individual,  a  partnership  or  a  corporation'.    Though  the  definition  of 'person'  in  section  2  includes  a  'trustee'  or  a  'body  of  persons',  section 19C(6)(e) specifically deals with the treatment of losses sustained by a trustee (see  paragraph  16  below). Hence,  sections  19C(4)  and  (5)  are  mainly  for corporations or bodies of persons.
12. Section 19C(4) provides that the loss arising from a trade, etc., shall be set off firstly against the corporation's or person's assessable profits for the same year of assessment. These assessable profits include the corporation's or person's share of the assessable profits of any partnership of which it is a partner. If the loss is not wholly set off, the balance is carried forward for set off  against  the  corporation's  or  person's  assessable  profits  (including  where appropriate, its share of the assessable profits of any partnership) for subsequent years until fully absorbed.
13. Section  19C(5)  deals  with  the  situation  in  which  a  corporation  or person  is  trading  in  a  partnership  and  the  partnership  sustains  a  loss. The corporation  or  person  can  set  off  its  share  of  the  partnership  loss  against  its assessable profits for the same year of assessment.    To the extent that the loss is not set off, it is carried forward to subsequent years and set off, first against the  corporation's  or  person's  share  of  profits  from  the  partnership  and  then against  its  own  assessable  profits  for  that  year. Unlike  section  19C(4),  this section does not provide for the set off of a corporation's or person's share of loss in a partnership against its share of profits in another partnership.
14. A  loss  sustained  by  a  corporation  can  be  used  to  set  off  the corporation's  share  of  assessable  profits  from  a  partnership  even  though  that partnership did not exist at the time the corporation incurred the loss.

## 15. Example  2  shows  how  losses  are  set  off  under  sections  19C(4) and (5):

## Example 2

A Limited carries on a trade on its own account. It is also a partner in a partnership business, entitled to a 50% share in the profits or loss of the partnership.

The results of A Limited are:

| Year ended 31 December 2006                  | Loss                                         | ($70,000)   |

|                        |                | (50% of $200,000) Set off of               |                        |
|                        |                | Unabsorbed loss under section 19C(5) (1)   | (20,000)               |

|                        |                | Unabsorbed loss carried forward            | NIL                    |

(1) The unabsorbed partnership loss brought forward of $20,000 has to be set off against A Limited's share of partnership profits of $100,000 first under section 19C(5). Therefore, no loss is available to A Limited for set off against the assessable profits from its own business.

## Trustees

16. Section  19C(6)(e)  deals  with  the  treatment  of  losses  incurred  by  a trustee who carries on a trade, profession or business in his capacity as a trustee. Such  losses  are  only  available  for  carry  forward  and  set  off  against  the assessable profits of the trust for subsequent years arising from the particular trade,  etc.,  in  which  the  losses  were  incurred.    This  provision  makes it  clear that  the  losses  of  a  trust  are  not  available  for  set  off  against  the  profits  of another trust administered by the same trustee; neither are they available for set off against any profits the trustee may derive in his personal capacity.

## Personal Assessment

17. If an individual has elected for personal assessment, section 42(2)(b) provides  that  his  business  loss  or  share  of  loss  incurred  in  the  year  shall  be deducted from his total income. The amount of loss exceeding total income is to  be  carried  forward  and  set  off  against  the  total  income  for  future  years  of assessment  until  such  amount  is  wholly  set  off  (see  sections  42(5)(a)(i) and (b)(i)).

## Example 3

During the year of assessment 2008/09, Mr. A, an individual who is single, has both income and business loss. Under personal assessment, his loss will be set off as follows:

|                                                                                        | $         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Total income                                                                           | 100,000   |
| Business loss                                                                          | (120,000) |
| Unabsorbed loss carried forward under personal assessment to the next year of election | 20,000    |

18. In  the  case  of  a  joint  election  under  section  41(1A),  the  unutilized current year business loss of an individual is used to set off against the spouse's total  income. Any excess  business  loss  will  be  carried  forward  to  the  next year of personal assessment election to set off firstly against the total income of the individual and then, if still not totally absorbed, against the total income of the spouse for that year (see sections 42(5)(a)(ii) and (b)(ii)).    Reference can be made to paragraph 58 and Appendix B of Departmental Interpretation and Practice  Notes  No.  18  for  further  details  of  the  transfer  of  losses  between spouses in personal assessment.

## Limitations on loss relief

19. Section 19C(6) makes it clear that a loss cannot be set off more than once and that the total amount set off against assessable profits is not to exceed the amount of the loss.

## UNABSORBED  LOSSES  FROM  NORMAL  AND  CONCESSIONARY TRADING RECEIPTS

## Cross set off

20. Sections 19CA and 19CB provide for the cross set off of unabsorbed losses from normal trading receipts and concessionary trading receipts. They apply  from  the  year  of  assessment  1998/99  onwards. As defined in  section 19CA(5), 'concessionary trading receipts' means the trading receipts and other sums  in  respect  of  which  assessable  profits  are  chargeable  to  tax  at  rate specified in section 14A  (i.e. qualifying debt instruments) or 14B  (i.e. qualifying  reinsurance  business  of  an  insurance  corporation),  and  'normal trading receipts' means the trading receipts and other sums in respect of which assessable profits are chargeable to tax at the rate specified in Schedule 1 or 8. For  this  purpose,  profits  or  loss  derived  from  normal  trading  receipts  are referred  to  as  'normal  profits  or  loss',  and  profits  or  loss  derived  from concessionary trading receipts are referred to as 'concessionary profits or loss'.

## Adjustment factor

21. As  the  two  streams  of  profits  are  taxed  at  different  rates,  it  is necessary to apply an adjustment factor to the profits or loss to be set off.    The adjustment  factor  is  the  ratio,  which  the  normal  and  concessionary  tax  rates bear to each other.    Thus for the year of assessment 2008/09, the adjustment factor is 2,

16.5% 15% i.e., for  corporations; for  persons  other  than  corporations. 8.25% 7.5%

The operations of sections 19CA and 19CB are further explained below.

## Same business and same year of assessment - Section 19CA

22. Section 19CA deals with the cross set off of normal profits or loss and concessionary profits or loss within the same year of assessment for the same  business. Section  19CA(2)  applies  when  a  taxpayer  has  unabsorbed concessionary loss and normal profits whilst section 19CA(3) applies when a taxpayer has unabsorbed normal loss and concessionary profits. The operation of this section under different scenarios is illustrated in Examples 4 to 7 below:

## Example  4  -  Normal  Profits  exceed  Concessionary  Loss  / Factor, Section 19CA(2)(a) scenario

| Profit / (loss) (1)                                                    | Normal trading receipts $ 10,000   | Concessionary trading receipts $ (18,000)   |

## Different business and different year of assessment - Section 19CB

23. Section  19CB  deals  with  the  set  off  of  profits  or  loss  between partnerships  and  corporations  and  also  loss  brought  forward  from  previous years of assessment. Section 19CB(2) applies when a taxpayer has concessionary loss to be set off against its normal profits whilst section 19CB(3) applies when  a taxpayer has a normal loss to be set off against its concessionary  profits.    The  essence  of  this  provision  with  regard  to  the application  of  the  adjustment  factor  is  the  same  as  that  for  section  19CA,  as demonstrated by Examples 8 to 11 below:

(1) Section  19CB(3)(b)  applies  as  the  amount  of  normal  loss  brought  forward exceeds  the  amount  of  concessionary  profits  as  divided  by  the  adjustment factor (i.e. $10,000 &gt; $18,000 ÷ 2).

(2) The  normal  loss  after  set  off  against  concessionary  profits  shall  be  carried forward.

(3) The  net  assessable  profits  from  concessionary  trading  receipts  shall  be deemed to be nil.

## Personal assessment is elected - Sections 19C(3A) and 42(1A)

24. Where personal assessment is elected and the loss or share of loss in any  year  of  assessment  consists  solely  of  the  balance  of  concessionary  loss calculated under section 19CA(2)(b), the amount of the loss or the share of loss to  be  transferred  to  personal  assessment  shall  be  deemed  to  be  the  amount arrived at by dividing such concessionary loss by the adjustment factor.    For instance, if personal assessment is elected in Example 5 above, the amount of concessionary  loss  to  be  deducted  from  the  total  income  of  the  personal assessment elector under section 42(2)(b) will be $2,000 (i.e. $4,000 ÷ 2).

## RIGHTS  OF  OBJECTION  AND  APPEAL  WHERE  LOSSES  ARE INCURRED

25. An  objection  to  the  Commissioner  (with  the  subsequent  right  of appeal  to  the  Board  of  Review  or  the  Court)  only  arises  when  a  person  is aggrieved  by  an  assessment.    A  computation  of  loss  does  not  state  'the amount of tax charged, and such due date for payment thereof' as stipulated in section 62(1), per Yam J in CIR v Yau Lai Man, Agnes trading as L. M. Yau &amp; Company 6 HKTC 485 .    This view was echoed by Deputy Judge To in CIR v Common Empire Limited 7 HKTC 52 where the learned judge at page 99 said:
2. 'An ascertainment of loss which does not result in the application of the appropriate rate of tax to that loss is not an assessment within the meaning of the Ordinance.'

In the Court of Appeal, Rogers VP confirmed this construction as correct.

26. Accordingly, no right of objection arises unless and until such time as any loss claimed affects an assessment to tax.    This right arises:
2. (a) Where the assessor has not agreed a loss claimed to have been sustained in a year of assessment, and a notice of assessment has  been  issued  resulting  in  a  liability  to  profits  tax  or personal tax for that year;
3. (b) Where the assessor has issued a notice of assessment with a liability to profits tax or personal tax for a year of assessment, which, in the opinion of the taxpayer, fails to set off of a loss sustained in the preceding year(s).
27. In the case of an unincorporated business (whether a sole proprietorship or a partnership), either the sole-proprietor or one or more of the partners may have elected for personal assessment.    If the assessor disagrees with a loss claimed under profits tax but does not raise a profits tax assessment, no  right  of  objection  under  profits  tax  arises  at  the  time.    However,  the sole-proprietor,  or  any  one  of  the  partners  who  has  elected  for  personal assessment,  will  be  able  to  object  against  the  personal  assessment  made  on them if they are aggrieved by the assessment which does not allow the business loss to be set off, or allows a smaller amount of business loss than that claimed.

28. Where  a  corporation  has  an  interest  in  a  partnership,  either  the corporation itself or the partnership in which the corporation is a partner may sustain a loss in a year which can be set off in accordance with sections 19C(4) and (5).    If the assessor disagrees with the loss claimed and the corporation or partnership, which is not allowed the benefit of the loss is aggrieved, a right of objection arises in the following situations:
2. (a) The  assessor  computes  the  loss  in  an  amount  less  than  that claimed:
3. (i) Where  the  profits  tax  assessment  is  raised  after  the issue  of  the  computation  of  loss,  within  one  month after the date of issue of that assessment;
4. (ii) Where the profits tax assessment was raised before the issue  of  the  computation  of  loss,  within  one  month after the date of issue of the revised profits tax assessment.
5. (b) The assessor does not agree that there is a loss and issues a 'Nil' computation of loss:
6. (i) Where  the  computation  of  loss  issues  prior  to  the profits tax assessment, within one month after the date of issue of that assessment;
7. (ii) Where the computation of loss issues after the profits tax  assessment,  within  one  month  after  the  date  of issue of that computation.

The onus of lodging the notice of objection against such an assessment rests with the person on whom the profits tax assessment was raised.
