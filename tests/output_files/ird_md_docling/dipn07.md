## PART I － INTRODUCTION

Sections  12(1)(b)  and  12(5)  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Ordinance  (the Ordinance)  provide  for  depreciation  allowances  and  charges  calculated  in accordance  with  Part  VI  of  the  Ordinance  to  be  taken  into  account  in ascertaining  the  net  assessable  income  of  a  person  subject  to  Salaries  Tax. Similarly, section 18F of the Ordinance provides for depreciation allowances and charges made under Part VI to be taken into account in ascertaining the assessable profits of a person subject to Profits Tax.

2. For years of assessment prior to 1980/81, the relevant provisions of Part VI are contained within sections 37, 37A, 38 and 39 (referred to in this Practice Note as 'the old scheme').  A revised scheme, known as 'the pooling system', was introduced with effect from the 1980/81 year of assessment by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 4) Ordinance 1980.  The calculation of depreciation  allowances  under  the  pooling  system  is  basically  provided  by sections  39B,  39C  and  39D. In  certain  circumstances,  provisions  of  the  old scheme, rather than of the pooling system, may apply in respect of a year of assessment subsequent to 1979/80.

## Persons entitled to the allowances

3. Depreciation  allowances  in  respect  of  machinery  and  plant  are  not restricted  to  persons  carrying  on  particular  kinds  of  trades,  professions  or businesses.  Rather, the allowances under sections 37 and 39B are available to every person carrying on a trade, profession or business in respect of which the person is chargeable to Profits Tax under Part IV of the Ordinance.  Similarly, by  virtue  of  section  12(1)(b),  all  employees  are  entitled  to  depreciation allowances where the use of plant or machinery is essential to the production of assessable income.

## Expenditure which qualifies

4. Depreciation allowances are made in respect of 'capital expenditure' incurred on the provision of machinery or plant. The term 'capital expenditure'  is  defined  in  section  40(1),  for  the  purposes  of  Part  VI  of  the Ordinance,  to  include  interest  and  commitment  fees  incurred  in  respect  of  a loan made for the purpose of financing the provision of machinery or plant.  On

the other hand, the definition excludes expenditure which is reimbursed by way of or is attributable to any grant, subsidy or similar financial assistance.  It also excludes, in relation to the person incurring the expenditure, any expenditure which is allowed to be deducted in ascertaining for the purpose of Part IV of the Ordinance the profits of a trade, profession or business carried on by that person.  It follows that depreciation allowances cannot be claimed in relation to expenditure which qualifies for deduction under, for example, section 16B (in respect  of  research  and  development),  16F  (on  building  refurbishment),  16G (on the provision of a prescribed fixed asset) or 16I (in relation to environmental  protection  facilities,  which  include  environmental  protection machinery).

5. It  should  be  noted  that  section  16G,  which  came  into  effect  on  1 April 1998, provides for the situation where a qualifying item of machinery or plant was acquired in an earlier year of assessment and has accordingly been the  subject  of  depreciation  allowances. In  such  a  case,  if  an  appropriate election  is  made,  a  deduction  is  allowed  under  the  section  in  respect  of  the 1998/99  year  of  assessment  for  the  capital  expenditure  incurred  on  the provision of the item, reduced by the aggregate of initial and annual allowances made  to  the  person  concerned  in  prior  years  of  assessment.    The  relevant amount ceases to qualify for depreciation allowances and must accordingly be excluded in relation to their computation for the 1998/99 and subsequent years of  assessment. In  respect  of  environmental  protection  machinery,  similar transitional provisions are contained in section 16K to deal with machinery or plant acquired before the commencement of section 16I (i.e. 27 June 2008).
6. Sections 37 and 39B refer to 'capital expenditure on the provision of machinery or plant', and subsection (2) of section 37 refers to 'the cost of the asset'.  Both phrases are construed as meaning the net cost of acquisition of the asset to the owner for the time being who is claiming the allowances. In this regard, the net cost of acquisition represents the supplier's price for the item, plus any charges relating to freight, insurance, delivery, import duties, etc., and less  any  discounts,  rebates,  subsidies,  etc.  accorded  to  the  purchaser.    The decision in C.I.R. v. Hong Kong Bottlers Ltd. (H.K.T.C. 497 ) was to the effect that cost is to be taken as meaning the same as capital expenditure incurred by the person claiming the allowance (but see paragraph 31 below as to machinery and plant which is acquired other than by purchase).

7. Hire  purchase  interest  charges  do  not  form  part  of  the  qualifying expenditure (see paragraphs 37 and 38 below).

## Meaning of 'machinery or plant'

8. The Ordinance does not provide an exhaustive definition of 'machinery or plant'.  However, section 40 of the Ordinance and Rule 2 of the Inland  Revenue  Rules  provide  assistance  in  determining  what  constitutes 'machinery or plant' for the purposes of making depreciation allowances.  The following points are pertinent in this regard.
- Section 40(1) provides, inter alia ,  that ' 'capital expenditure on  the  provision  of  machinery  or  plant'  includes  capital expenditure on alterations to an existing building incidental to the installation of that machinery or plant for the purposes of the trade, profession or business'.
- Rule 2 provides that items specified in the second column of the First Part of the Table annexed to the rule are deemed to be  included  in  the  expression  'machinery  or  plant'  (see Appendix A(i)).  On the other hand, the rule also provides that items  specified  in  the  second  column  of  the  Second  part  of that Table (Appendix A(ii)) are deemed not to be included in that  expression  (accordingly  depreciation  allowances  cannot be  made),  but  instead  are  deemed  for  the  purposes  of  the Ordinance to be included in the expression 'any implement, utensil and article'. The latter grouping includes such items as  loose  tools,  crockery  and  linen  which  are  normally  dealt with under the 'replacement'  basis specified in section 16(1)(f).  Finally, Rule 2 provides that wharves shall not be or be deemed to be 'plant or machinery'.
9. Nevertheless,  as  has  been  stated  above,  the  term  'machinery  or plant'  is  not  exhaustively  defined,  and  for  the  purposes  of  depreciation allowances, the Table annexed to Rule 2 per Appendix A(i) lists as the last of the items 'machinery or plant, not specified in items 1 to 34'.  Accordingly, where depreciation allowances are claimed in respect of expenditure on an item

not specifically listed, it is necessary to consider whether the item falls within the general description of 'machinery or plant'.

10. The meaning of the phrase 'machinery or plant' has been considered in  a  number  of  cases  by  the  courts  in  Hong  Kong  and  other  common  law jurisdictions. On the basis  of  the  principles  established,  the  Department  has taken positions in relation to a number of items which are not specifically listed in Appendix A(i) or (ii).  In this regard, Appendix B enumerates items which are recognised as machinery or plant, and Appendix C enumerates items which are not so recognised.

## Capital expenditure incurred prior to commencement of business

11. Where a person carries on a trade and incurs capital expenditure on the provision of assets for a new trade about to be commenced, the Ordinance does not provide for deductions or allowances to be granted in respect of the expenditure against the profits of the existing trade. However, section 40(2) provides, for the purposes of Part VI, that in such a situation the expenditure is treated  as  if  it  were  incurred  on  the  day  that  the  new  trade  commences. Accordingly, if the expenditure is incurred on the provision of machinery or plant, allowances can be granted against the profits of the new trade, once it has commenced.
12. Where a  person  ceases  to  carry  on  a  particular  trade  and  transfers machinery or plant previously used in it to another trade which he carries on, it is  not  considered  that  the  person  is  entitled  to  claim  more  than  one  annual allowance in respect of that machinery or plant for any one year of assessment. This is because the allowance is granted to the 'person' and not to the 'trade'.

## Basis period

13. The basis period for the purpose of calculating depreciation allowances is generally the same as that used by the taxpayer concerned for the purpose of computing assessable profits.  The term 'basis period' is defined in section 40(1) so that for the purposes of Part VI, apart from the situation where either of two specified exceptions is applicable, it has the same meaning as that assigned to it by section 2 of the Ordinance (i.e. ' 'basis period' for any year of

assessment is the period on the income or the profits of which tax for that year ultimately falls to be computed'). The two exceptions, so far as is relevant, are:

- (a) where two basis periods overlap, the period common to both is deemed to fall into the first period only; and
- (b) where there is an interval between the end of the basis period for  one  year  of  assessment  and  the  beginning  of  the  basis period for the next succeeding year of assessment, the interval is deemed to fall into the second basis period.
14. The meaning assigned to the term 'basis period' in Part VI ensures that  on  a  change  of  accounting  date  by  a  taxpayer,  initial  allowance  is  only granted once in respect of expenditure incurred in a period which is common to two basis periods, and also that the allowance is not lost where expenditure is incurred during an interval between two basis periods.

## Part II － THE 'POOLING SYSTEM' － 1980/81 Onwards

## Background

15. As was mentioned earlier, the 'pooling system' for making depreciation allowances was introduced by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No.  4)  Ordinance  1980  and  has  been  in  effect  since  the  year  of  assessment 1980/81. The  pooling  system  was  not  introduced  with  the  intention  of fundamentally changing the depreciation allowances or charges made under the old  scheme. Rather,  the  intention  was  merely  to  save  time  and  expense  by modifying the old scheme to reduce the need to maintain detailed depreciation records  in  respect  of  individual  items of  machinery  and  plant.    The  pooling system seeks to achieve this objective by, in essence, creating a single 'pool' of expenditure in respect of all items of machinery or plant which qualify for a particular rate of annual allowance.

## The allowances

## Initial allowance

16. Section 39B(1) provides for an initial allowance to be made where 'a person carrying on a trade, profession or business incurs capital expenditure on the  provision  of  machinery  or  plant'  for  the  purposes  of  producing  profits chargeable to Profits Tax.  As with the corresponding provision under the old scheme  (section  37(1)),  section  39B(1)  provides  that  the  initial  allowance  is made to the person for the year of assessment in the basis period for which the expenditure is incurred.  There is no requirement that the asset must be in use in  the  basis  period,  but  the  allowance is subject to the asset eventually being acquired and used in the trade carried on.
17. As  initial  allowance  is  made  in  respect  of  capital  expenditure 'incurred',  it  is  not  limited  to  sums  actually  paid.    Where  a  contractual obligation exists, the due date for payment of deposits, instalments, etc. will be regarded as the date when the expenditure is incurred, even if actual payment occurs at a later date. It should be noted, however, that no allowance can be made  in  respect  of  what  is  merely  a  contingent  liability.    It  follows  that  a deposit or advance payment is not recognised as expenditure incurred on the provision  of  machinery  or  plant  unless  it  has  been  paid  on  a  non-refundable basis  in  respect  of  a  binding  purchase  contract.    In  the  absence  of  a  written contract, the date of delivery of the asset is normally taken to be the date on which the expenditure is incurred.
18. The rate of initial allowance for any year of assessment commencing on or after 1 April 1989 is 60% (section 39B(1A)(c) and, where the old scheme is applicable, section 36A(3)(c)).

## Annual allowance

19. Section  39B(2)  provides  for  an  annual  allowance  to  be  given  for each  year  of  assessment. This  is  calculated  at  the  appropriate  rate  on  the reducing  value  of  each  class  or pool of  machinery  or  plant.    A  class  of machinery or plant is made up of all such items eligible for the same rate of annual allowance (see paragraph 21).  Unlike the position in respect of annual allowances under the old system (see section 37(2)), there  is  no  requirement

under the pooling system to the effect that the asset must be owned and in use at the end of the basis period.

20. Section 39B(2) provides, in effect, for annual allowance to be made to a person where he has at some time (not necessarily during the basis period for the current year of assessment) owned and had 'in use' any machinery or plant for the purpose of producing profits chargeable to Profits Tax.  It is the Department's  view  that  the  words  'in  use'  should  not  be  strictly  construed. Thus where a machine is temporarily idled during the last few days of a basis period, e.g. awaiting commencement of a new production run, the machine is considered to be 'in use' for the purposes of the allowance.  In regard to spare parts,  e.g.  reserve  engines  for  taxis,  the  Department's  position  is  that  where these  are  'on  the  bench'  ready  for  installation  and  use,  they  qualify  for  the allowance.  However, where spares are held in store for issue or are held crated as  received  from  the  supplier,  they  are  not  considered  to  be  'in  use'  for  the purposes of the allowance.

## Annual allowance rates

21. Section 39B(3) provides that the annual allowance shall be calculated  at  the  rates  of  depreciation  prescribed  by  the  Board  of  Inland Revenue  and  shall  be  computed  on  the  reducing  value  of  each  class  of machinery or plant.  The rates prescribed by the Board are set out in the third column of the First part of the Table annexed to Rule 2 of the Inland Revenue Rules. The Table (see Appendix A(i)) specifies the rates of depreciation for certain  classifications  of  machinery  and  plant  and,  for  those  not  specifically itemised, lays down a general rate of 20%.  [The same rates apply in respect of annual allowances made under the old scheme (section 37(2)).]

## Calculation of the allowances

22. Apart  from  its  role  in  relation  to  the  rates  of  depreciation,  section 39B(3)  also  provides  that  the  annual  allowance  'shall  be  computed  on  the reducing value of each class of machinery or plant'.  Section 39B(4), (5), (6) and (7) detail what is meant by the reducing value of a class of machinery or plant.  In essence, the 'reducing value' of a class of machinery or plant (i.e. the figure which is multiplied by the prescribed rate of depreciation to calculate the

annual allowance to be made in respect of the class concerned for the year of assessment under consideration) is arrived at by aggregating (as applicable):

- (a) the  reducing  value  of  the  class  (i.e.  the  'pool')  brought forward from the end of the previous year of assessment;
- (b) the amount of qualifying capital expenditure incurred on the provision of machinery and plant of the same class during the basis  period  for  the  current  year,  less  any  initial  allowance given  in  respect  of  that  expenditure.  [Expenditure  does  not qualify if incurred in respect of machinery or plant which is either  under  hire-purchase (section 39C(1)(a)) or only partly used for the purpose of producing chargeable profits (section 39C(1)(b)).  These categories are further discussed in Part III below];
- (c) the reducing value (i.e. capital expenditure incurred less any initial  or  annual  allowances  made),  as  at  the  end  of  the previous  year  of  assessment,  of  each  item  of  machinery  or plant  acquired  under  hire-purchase  which  passed  into  the ownership of the person during the previous year of assessment  (see  section  39C(2)  and  paragraphs  37  and  38 below);
- (d) in respect of each item of machinery or plant owned and used by the  person  for  any  period  immediately  before  using  it  to produce chargeable profits in the particular year of assessment, the actual cost of the item less the notional annual allowances which would have been made under section 37 if the owner had used the item since acquisition for the purpose of  producing  chargeable  profits  (see  section  39B(6)  and paragraphs 25 to 27 below);
- (e) the reducing value taken over (as a result of succession during the  year  of  assessment  to  a  trade,  profession  or  business)  of machinery  or  plant  acquired  without  being  purchased  (see section 39B(7) and paragraph 31 below);

## and deducting (as applicable):

- (f) the aggregate of any sale, insurance, salvage or compensation money received in respect of any item of machinery or plant belonging  to  that  class  disposed  of  during  the  basis  period (see section 39B(4)(e) and paragraphs 28, 49 and 50 below); and
- (g) the reducing value (determined by the Commissioner) of any machinery or plant previously used wholly and exclusively in the  production  of  profits  which  ceased  to  be  so  used  during the basis period (see section 39C(3) and paragraph 30 below).
23. The  following  examples  illustrate  the  operation  of  the  pooling system.    [In  considering  the  examples  in  this  Practice  Note,  it  should  be assumed,  unless  information  to  the  contrary  is  provided,  that  the  taxpayer concerned is carrying on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong and that the  machinery  or  plant  is  used  therein  by  the  taxpayer  for  the  purpose  of producing profits chargeable to Profits Tax.]

## Example 1

24. A taxpayer commenced business on 2 February 1994.  The accounts of the business are made up to 31 December each year.  During the first year of trading, the following items of machinery and plant were purchased:

| 1 motor car                   | $150,000   | (30% annual allowance rate)   |
|-------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|
| 3 electric cookers            | $50,000    | (30% annual allowance rate)   |
| 1 set of office furniture     | $20,000    | (20% annual allowance rate)   |
| 2 room air-conditioning units | $28,000    | (20% annual allowance rate)   |

Machinery and plant depreciable at the same annual allowance rate is 'pooled' together  for  the  purpose  of  calculating  the  depreciation  allowances.    For  the year of assessment 1994/95, the company is entitled to depreciation allowances totalling $176,640, computed as follows:

|                    | 30% Pool $   | 20% Pool $   | Allowance $   |

During the year ended 31 December 1995, the motor car was damaged beyond repair in an accident.  The insurance company paid $30,000 and the taxpayer also obtained $1,000 from a scrap dealer for the wreck.  During the same year, a new van was purchased for $180,000, an electric cooker was disposed of for $3,000, and a room air-conditioning unit was sold for $2,000, replaced with a new one purchased for $8,000.

For  the  year  of  assessment  1995/96,  the  taxpayer  would  be  entitled  to depreciation allowances totalling $144,312, computed as follows:

## Assets brought into the business after non-business use

25. Under  both  the  old  scheme  and  the  pooling  system  (see  sections 37(2A) and 39B(6)), notional allowances have  to  be  computed  if  an  item  of

machinery or  plant  is  owned  and  used  by  a  person  before  he  uses  it  for  the purpose of producing profits chargeable to tax.  In such a case, for the purpose of calculating the annual allowance in respect of the item (i.e. the amount to be included  in  the  pool  where  the  pooling  system  is  applicable),  the  capital expenditure  incurred  on  the  provision  of  the  item  is  computed  by  deducting from  its  actual  cost  the  notional  amount  of  the  annual  allowance  that  would have been made under section 37 to the owner if since acquiring the machinery or plant he had used it for the purpose of producing profits chargeable to tax. There is no provision for deducting a notional initial allowance from the actual cost.

26. No  entitlement  to  initial  allowance  arises  in  such  circumstances. This  is  because  entitlement  only  arises  under  the  respective  Profits  Tax  and Salaries Tax provisions where it can be said of the relevant capital expenditure that it was incurred on the provision of machinery or plant  for the purpose of producing  profits chargeable  to tax under  Part  IV, or in the case of employment, machinery or plant the use of which is essential to the production of the assessable income .  It follows that where the expenditure is incurred for some other purpose, irrespective of how the machinery or plant is subsequently used, the requirement for entitlement is not satisfied.

## Example 2

27. A taxpayer, who had been trading for some years, purchased a car for private use on 10 May 1994 at a cost of $160,000.  The car was transferred to business use on 12 August 1996.  The taxpayer's accounts are made up to 31 March each year.

|                        |                                   | 30% Pool $   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| Actual Cost            | Actual Cost                       | 160,000      |
| Less :                 | 1994/95 Notional annual allowance |              |
|                        | $160,000 x 30%                    | 48,000       |
|                        |                                   | 112,000      |
| Less :                 | 1995/96 Notional annual allowance |              |
|                        | $112,000 x 30%                    | 33,600       |
| Notional cost of asset | Notional cost of asset            | 78,400       |

Note: For  the  purposes  of  the  30%  pool  in  the  1996/97  and subsequent years of assessment, the car would be treated as if it had been purchased on 12 August 1996 for $78,400.

## *****

## Proceeds of machinery or plant disposed of

28. The  Ordinance  makes  it  clear  that  any  sale,  insurance,  salvage  or compensation  moneys  received  in  respect  of  machinery  or  plant  which  has been included in a pool is to be deducted in ascertaining the reducing value of the  pool  (section  39B(4)(e))  and,  where  cessation  is  involved,  in  calculating any  balancing  charge  required  to  be  made  under  section  39D(2)(b)  (see paragraph 32 below).  Thus, if machinery or plant is destroyed, the sum to be taken into account is generally the total of any insurance, salvage or compensation  received. However,  section  39D(6)  provides  that  the  total amount taken into account is not to exceed the capital expenditure incurred on the provision of the particular item. Where the asset was introduced into the business after non-business use, the relevant figure is the capital  expenditure computed in accordance with section 39B(6) (i.e. the actual cost of the asset less notional annual allowances for the years of non-business use).

## Example 3

29. The reducing value of a taxpayer's 30%  pool  after 1995/96 allowances was $36,000. During the year ended 30 June 1996, a van which had cost $138,000 was sold for $140,000.  A car, which had been purchased in July 1993 for $320,000, was introduced into the business on 1 September 1995. The accounts of the taxpayer are made up to 30 June each year.

Note:

- (i) No initial allowance is due on the car introduced as no capital expenditure was incurred during the basis period.
- (ii)  Any new expenditure has to be added to the pool before disposal  proceeds  are  deducted.    Even  though  the  van was  sold  for  $2,000  more  than  its  purchase  price,  the disposal  value  is  not  to  exceed  the  capital  expenditure incurred on the provision of the particular item.

## *****

## Assets removed from pool for non-business use

30. Where an item of machinery or plant which has been used wholly and  exclusively  in  the  production  of  chargeable  profits  ceases  to  be  so  used (e.g. when it becomes used wholly or partly for private purposes), its reducing value must be deducted from that of the pool for the year of assessment during the  basis  period  for  which  the  change  occurred.    The  reducing  value  of  the machinery or plant is deemed, under section 39C(3), to be the amount which the Commissioner considers the item in question would have realised if sold in the open market at the time it ceased to be wholly and exclusively used in the production  of  chargeable  profits. Depreciation  allowances  are  separately

calculated for the year of change, and for subsequent years for so long as the item  continues  to  be  used  (partly  or  wholly)  in  the  production  of  chargeable profits (see paragraphs 43 and 44 below).

## Succession to a trade, etc.

31. The  provisions  of  section  39B(7)  cater  for  the  situation  where  a person succeeds to a trade, profession or business and are broadly similar to those of section 37(4), relating to the old scheme.  Thus, if on succession to a trade, ownership of machinery or plant passes to the successor without it being sold to him, the reducing value of each pool of expenditure unallowed to the old proprietor is taken over by the new proprietor.  The successor is entitled to annual allowance under section 39B(2) once the machinery or plant is used to produce chargeable profits in his trade.  The successor is not, however, entitled to any initial allowance in respect of such machinery or plant (section 39B(8)). For  the  purpose  of  calculating  any  subsequent  reduction  from  the  pool  or balancing charge on disposal, the cost of the asset acquired by the successor in this  way  will  be  deemed to be equal to  the  reducing  value  of  the  pool  taken over.

## Balancing allowances and balancing charges

32. Section 39D(2) provides that where a person ceases to trade and the sale, etc., moneys received for the machinery or plant are less than the reducing value in the pool, a balancing allowance equal to the difference is to be made. This is the only situation in which a balancing allowance can be given － any sum received on the disposal of an asset at any other time is simply deducted from the value of the pool.  A balancing charge can, however, arise whenever disposal proceeds exceed the reducing value of the pool (i.e. not only on the disposal of a class of machinery or plant on the cessation of trading).  However, it  should  be  noted  that  by  virtue  of  section  39D(3),  no  balancing  charge  or balancing allowance can arise where on cessation machinery or plant passes to a successor to whom the reducing value of the machinery or plant is transferred under section 39B(7).

## Example 4

33. A taxpayer owned three motor vehicles as at 30 June 1994.  During the year ended 30 June 1995 he sold one for $130,000 without replacing it, and during the following year another for $60,000, again without replacing it.  In each case the vehicle was sold for less than its original cost.  The accounts of the business are made up to 30 June each year.

The reducing value carried forward after the 1994/95 allowances was $125,000 for the 30% pool.  As a result of the disposals, balancing charges, computed as follows, would be made:

## Year of Assessment 1995/96

|                                  | 30% Pool $   |
|----------------------------------|--------------|
| Reducing value b/f               | 125,000      |
| Less: Disposal value             | 130,000      |
| Balancing charge [s.39D(1)(a)]   | 5,000        |
| Reducing value c/f [s.39D(1)(b)] | nil          |

## Year of Assessment 1996/97

|                                 | 30% Pool   |
|---------------------------------|------------|
| Reducing value b/f              | nil        |
| Less: Disposal value            | 60,000     |
| Balancing charge [s. 39D(1)(a)] | 60,000     |

## Example 5

34. A taxpayer commenced trading in 1976.  His accounts were made up to 30 September each year. On 15 May 1996 he ceased trading. During the final  year  he  purchased  machinery  costing  $20,000,  which  qualified  for  the 20% annual allowance rate. The reducing values of the 20% and 30% pools after  the  1995/96  allowances  were  $13,000  and  $21,000  respectively.    On

cessation, the machinery and plant were sold for $15,000 and $28,000, for the 20%  and  30%  pools  respectively. The  resulting  balancing  allowance  and balancing charge for the cessation year would be computed as follows:

## Year of Assessment 1996/97

|                                 | 30% Pool $   | 20% Pool $   |
|---------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Reducing value b/f              | 21,000       | 13,000       |
| Add: New asset                  |              | 20,000       |
|                                 |              | 33,000       |
| Less: I.A.                      |              | 12,000       |
|                                 |              | 21,000       |
| Less: Sale proceeds             | 28,000       | 15,000       |
| Balancing allowance [s. 39D(2)] |              | 6,000        |
| Balancing charge [s. 39D(2)]    | 7,000        |              |

Note :  As a matter of practice, no annual allowance is computed for the year of cessation, but initial allowance is due on capital expenditure incurred during the final basis period.

*****

## Assets put out of use upon cessation of a trade, etc.

35. Section 38(4) and section 39D(4) and (5) contain similar rules to the effect  that  where  machinery  or  plant  is  put  out  of  use  by  reason  of  a  person ceasing to carry on a trade, the person is deemed to have received immediately prior to the cessation sale proceeds for the machinery or plant of such amount as the Commissioner may consider it would have realised if sold in the open market.  However, if within twelve months of the date of cessation the taxpayer sells  the  asset,  he  may  claim  the  adjustment  of  any  balancing  allowance  or balancing charge which may have been made to or on him as if the actual sale had  taken  place  immediately  prior  to  the  date  of  cessation.    The  sections provide for such an adjustment to be made, notwithstanding that the assessment may  otherwise  have  become  final  and  conclusive  under  the  provisions  of section  70. These  sections  are  not  considered  to  apply  where  following  the

cessation  of  a  trade  any  machinery  or  plant  previously  used  therein  is transferred to another trade carried on by the same person, whether or not there is an intervening period between the cessation and the transfer.

## Example 6

36. On 15 February 1995 a taxpayer ceased to carry on a business.  The accounts of the business had been made up to 31 March each year.  The items of  machinery  and  plant  included  in  the  30%  pool,  which  originally  cost $75,000  and  had  a  reducing  value  of  $21,000  after  the  1993/94  allowances, were sold shortly after cessation of the business for $80,000.

Items  (consisting  of  office  furniture)  in  the  20%  pool,  which  originally  cost $20,000 and had a reducing value of $6,400 after the 1993/94 allowances, had not been sold when the accounts for the final period of trading were submitted to  the  Inland  Revenue  Department.    In  accordance  with  section  39D(4),  the Commissioner placed an open market value of $7,200 on the furniture.

On 7 June 1995, a Notice of Assessment was issued to the taxpayer advising the assessable profits under section 18D for the final year of assessment of the business, i.e. 1994/95.  No objection was lodged in respect of the assessment. However, on 11 November 1995, the taxpayer advised the Department that the office  furniture  had  been  sold  for  $5,000,  and  claimed  adjustment  to  the assessment in accordance with section 39D(5).  Balancing charges, computed as follows, would have been included in the original assessment:

|                    | 30% Pool $   | 20% Pool $   |             |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Reducing value b/f | 21,000       | 6,400        |             |
| Less: Sale price   | 80,000       | 7,200        | [s. 39D(4)] |
| Balancing charge*  | 59,000       | 800          |             |

* The balancing charge for the 30% pool would be restricted, in effect, under section 39D(6) to $54,000, being the total of the allowances previously granted to the taxpayer, i.e. $75,000 － $21,000.

The total balancing charge would be $54,800 i.e. $54,000 + $800.

Upon receipt of the claim under section 39D(5), a revised assessment would be issued to  reflect  the  following  adjustment  to  the  balancing  charge  previously made in respect of the 20% pool:

|                                              | 20% Pool $   |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Reducing value b/f                           | 6,400        |
| Less: Actual sale proceeds                   | 5,000        |
| Balancing allowance                          | 1,400        |
| Add: Previous balancing charge now withdrawn | 800          |
| Reduction in assessment                      | 2,200        |

## Part  III － SITUATIONS  WHERE  THE  POOLING  SYSTEM  DOES NOT APPLY

## Assets acquired under hire purchase agreements

37. Section 39C(1)(a) provides that the pooling system does not apply in respect of machinery  or  plant  being  acquired  under  hire purchase  (i.e. machinery or plant in respect of which section 37A applies).  The initial and annual allowances due in respect of expenditure incurred on the provision of such  machinery  or  plant  must  be  calculated  separately,  as  per  Example  7 below.  In effect, the legislation provides that for each year of assessment in the basis period for which the taxpayer has made an instalment payment, an initial allowance is made in respect of the capital element of the instalment payments made  during  the  basis  period.    However,  when  the  instalment  payments  are completed  and  no  further  initial  allowance  is  due,  the  reducing  value  of  the asset is added to the appropriate pool, i.e. in the year of assessment following the year of assessment during the basis period for which the machinery or plant passes into the ownership of the taxpayer (section 39C(2)).

## Example 7

38. A  taxpayer  acquired  a  suite  of  office  furniture  at  a  hire  purchase price of $220,000 in January 1995.  The cash price was $160,000.  A deposit of $10,000 was paid in January 1995. The first of 24 monthly instalments was

paid  in  February  1995. The  taxpayer  closes  his  accounts  on  31  March annually.  Depreciation allowances would be made to the taxpayer as follows:

|                                             | 20%HP $   | Allowance $   | Y/A     |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Cost                                        | 160,000   |               |         |
| Less: I.A. ($10,000 + 150,000 x 2/24) x 60% | 13,500    | 13,500        |         |

## Total depreciation allowances not to exceed total capital expenditure

39. It  should  be  appreciated  that  initial  and  annual  allowances  are provided under the Ordinance as a process of allocation of capital expenditure. It therefore follows that where an item of machinery or plant is acquired under a hire purchase agreement, the total amount of depreciation allowances made to a taxpayer should not exceed the amount of capital expenditure incurred on the item.  The following example provides an illustration of a situation where the limitation would be applied.

## Example 8

40. A taxpayer entered into a hire purchase agreement in July 1993 to acquire a tractor, at a hire purchase price of $250,000. A deposit of $30,000 was paid. The hire purchase price included interest of $40,000.  The first of 36 monthly  instalments  was  paid  in  August  1993.    The  taxpayer  makes  up accounts  to  31  December  each  year. The following depreciation  allowances would be made to the taxpayer.

## Balancing allowance concession

41. It is recognised that in some cases where machinery or plant under a hire  purchase  agreement  is  repossessed  by,  or  voluntarily  returned  to,  the vendor,  the  taxpayer's  total  capital  expenditure  may  exceed  the  sum  of  the depreciation  allowances  made  prior  to  the  disposal  and  whatever  amount,  if any, is received from the vendor upon the latter's disposal of the repossessed or returned asset. In such a situation (i.e. where the machinery or plant is under hire purchase), the Ordinance does not provide for any balancing allowance to be  made  to  the  taxpayer  in  respect  of  the  excess.    The  Department  does, however, by way of an extra-statutory concession, grant such an allowance.

## Example 9

42. In  June  1995  a  taxpayer  entered  into  a  hire  purchase  agreement  to acquire office furniture.  The hire purchase price of the furniture was $120,000, including an interest element of $20,000.  A deposit $10,000 was paid in June 1995, and the first of the 24 monthly instalments covering the balance was paid in July 1995.  The taxpayer ceased paying instalments in April 1996 (i.e. after 9 instalments had been paid), shortly after which the furniture was repossessed (the taxpayer did not receive any payment  from  the vendor after the repossession).  The taxpayer continued to carry on the business.  The accounts of the business are made up to 31 December each year.

Whereas  the  total  amount  of  capital  expenditure  paid  by  the  taxpayer  was $43,750  (i.e. $10,000  +  $90,000  x  9/24),  the  total of the depreciation allowances which could be made to the taxpayer under section 37A would be, as  can  be  seen  below,  $42,350  (i.e.  $19,500  +  $16,100  +  $6,750).    In  the circumstances, a concessional allowance in respect of the difference of $1,400 (i.e. $43,750 － $42,350) would be made to the taxpayer.

## Machinery or plant used partly for the purposes of the trade, etc.

43. Section 39C(1)(b) provides, in effect, that the pooling system does not  apply  to  assets  which  are  used  only  partially  for  producing  chargeable profits.  The allowances due in respect of any such asset need to be separately calculated in accordance with the old scheme so that the appropriate apportionment  for  non-business  usage  can  be  made  (under  section  12(2), 18F(1)  or  19E(1)). Any  such  reduction  does  not  affect  the  calculation  of subsequent  allowances  which  are  computed  in  the  first  place  as  if  the  full amount had been granted, and then apportioned as appropriate in relation to the extent  to  which  the  asset  is  or  has  been  used  (a)  in  the  production  of  the chargeable profits and (b) for other purposes (section 39A).
44. Even  if  partial  non-business  use  ceases,  and  the  asset  is  then  used wholly  for  business  purposes,  separate  calculations  must  continue.    This  is because  any  balancing  charge  on  subsequent  disposal  of  the  asset  has  to  be apportioned to take into account the earlier non-business usage.
45. The  following  example  illustrates  the  method  of  calculating  the allowances and balancing charge where the proportion of non-business use has not been constant.

## Example 10

46. A taxpayer commenced to carry on a business on 1 June 1991, on which date he purchased a motor vehicle for $280,000.  This vehicle was used wholly  for  business  purposes  until  31  March  1992.    As  from  1  April  1992 (after  the  taxpayer  had  sold  his  private  car),  the  vehicle  was  used  partly  for private purposes, with the estimated private use being 50% of the total annual mileage.  Twelve months later, the private use portion had declined to 25%.  In June 1994 the vehicle was sold for $60,000.  The taxpayer's accounts are made up to 31 March each year.

The reducing value of the car at the end of that year (i.e.  $78,400)  would  have  been  excluded  from  the  pool  for  the  separate calculation  of  depreciation  allowances  in  1992/93  (i.e.  the  year  in  which the car ceased to be used wholly for business purposes).

* 2 For  the  1994/95  year  of  assessment,  a  balancing  charge,  calculated  as follows, would be made:

$21,584 x $225,708 / ($225,708 + $15,876) = $20,165

## Part IV － MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

## Commissioner's discretion － rate of annual allowance

47. Both proviso (b) to section 37(2) and section 39(B)(11) empower the Commissioner in his discretion to allow a higher rate for annual allowance than that  prescribed  by  the  Board  of  Inland  Revenue.    An  application  for  an increased rate of allowance should include the following details:
2. (a) the estimated working life of the asset;
3. (b) the anticipated disposal/scrap value of the asset at the end of its working life; and
4. (c) where excessive wear and tear is claimed in respect of the use of  an  asset  on  a  specific  project,  the  possibility  of  it  being restored/repaired for further use in the business on completion of the project.
48. At the present time, the rates of initial and annual allowances are such that the Commissioner considers it unlikely that any claim for a higher annual allowance could be justified.

## Assets sold together

49. Particularly where cessation occurs, it is not uncommon to find that assets are sold together for one price, without the consideration in respect of each asset being separately specified.  Where this occurs the Commissioner is empowered, by virtue of the provisions of section 38A, to allocate a price to each individual asset.

## Transactions between related parties

50. Section 38B provides for the situation where the Commissioner is of the opinion that the sale price of an asset, which qualifies for initial or annual allowances, does not represent its true market value, and any of the following circumstances are applicable:
2. (a) the buyer is a person over whom the seller has control; or
3. (b) the seller is a person over whom the buyer has control; or
4. (c) both  the  seller  and  the  buyer  are  persons  over  both  of whom some other person has control; or
5. (d) the sale is between a husband and wife, not being a wife living apart from her husband.

In such a case, the section provides that the Commissioner may determine the true market value at the time of the sale, and that value is deemed to be the sale price  of  the  asset  for  the  purpose  of  calculating  the  allowances  and  charges under part VI of the Ordinance.

## Commissioner's power to direct that the old scheme should apply

51. Section  36A(2)  gives  the  Commissioner  power  to  direct  the  extent and the duration for which the provisions of the old scheme shall continue to apply  for  any  year  of  assessment  from  1980/81  onwards,  whenever  he  is satisfied that the application of any of the provisions of the pooling system to any machinery or plant would be impracticable or inequitable.
