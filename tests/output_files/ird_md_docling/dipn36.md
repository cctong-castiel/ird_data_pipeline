## INTRODUCTION

## Summary of legal framework

With effect from the year of assessment 1998/99, a person chargeable to  salaries  tax  or  electing  for  personal  assessment  may  claim  a  deduction  for elderly residential care expenses paid by the person or the person's spouse to a residential care home in respect of a parent or grandparent.  Subject to meeting the entitlement criteria for the deduction, a person chargeable to tax at standard rate is also allowed to claim a deduction for elderly residential care expenses in computing the tax payable.  The deduction was first introduced by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Ordinance 1998.   The relevant legislation is contained in section 26D of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (IRO).

## ELDERLY RESIDENTIAL CARE EXPENSES

## Conditions for deduction

2. The conditions for deduction of elderly residential care expenses are:
2. (a) the care is residential care provided in a residential care home;
3. (b) the recipient of the residential care is a parent or grandparent of the person who made the deduction claim or that of the person's spouse;
4. (c) the parent or grandparent is 60 years old or above, or is entitled to claim an allowance under the Government's Disability Allowance Scheme;
5. (d) the payment for the care was made by the person or the person's spouse;
6. (e) the payment was made in the year of assessment;

1

- (f) the deduction allowable cannot exceed the maximum prescribed amount;
- (g) only  one  person  can  claim  the  deduction  for  each  parent  or grandparent;
- (h) the  deduction  is  allowed  in  lieu  of  the  granting  of  a  dependent parent or dependent grandparent allowance.

## Residential care expenses

3. The term 'residential care expenses' is defined under section 26D(5) of the IRO to mean any expenses payable in respect of the residential care received at a residential care home and paid to that residential care home or any other person acting on its behalf.  The deduction covers only the cost of care provided to qualifying parent or grandparent who is resident in a residential care home. The cost of care provided to a qualifying parent or grandparent attending homes where care is provided on a non-residential basis, including an out-patient basis, is not deductible as residential care expenses  because  the 'residential' requirement is not satisfied.
4. Section 26D does not limit the nature of expenses incurred by residential care homes that qualify for the deduction.  Rather, it allows a person a deduction for fees paid to the home for providing the residential care.  The amounts paid by a person must nevertheless be in respect of the provision of residential care. Residents' private expenses initially met by the home on the residents' behalf and then recovered from the persons responsible for the settlement of individual residents'  accounts  are  not  residential  care  expenses.    For  example,  cash advances  made  by  homes  to  their  residents  to  enable  the  residents  to  meet personal  expenditure  needs  are  not  expenses  in  respect  of  residential  care received at a residential care home.  The amount of any such advances recovered by  the  residential  care  home  from  the  family  member  of  the  resident  is  not deductible under section 26D as residential care expenses.
5. Residential  care  expenses  may  be  paid  either  directly  to  the  home providing the residential care or to a third party or agent specified by the home. When a residential care home appoints a management agent or collection agent to receive fees on its behalf, the amounts paid in accordance with the home's

instructions are, subject to the other provisions of section 26D being satisfied, an allowable deduction.

## Residential care homes

6. Under section 26D(5), residential care home means any premises:
2. (a) in  respect  of  which  a  licence  issued  or  renewed  under  the Residential Care Homes (Elderly Persons) Ordinance (Cap. 459) (RCHEO) is for the time being in force;
3. (b) in respect of which a certificate of exemption issued or renewed under the RCHEO is for the time being in force;
4. (c) to which the RCHEO does not apply by virtue of section 3 of that Ordinance;
5. (d) which is a nursing home in respect of which any person has been registered under section 3 of the Hospitals, Nursing Homes and Maternity Homes Registration Ordinance (Cap. 165) (HNMRO);
6. (e) in  respect  of  which  a  licence  issued  or  renewed  under  the Residential  Care  Homes  (Persons  with  Disabilities)  Ordinance (Cap. 613) (RCHPO) is for the time being in force; or
7. (f) in respect of which a certificate of exemption issued or renewed under the RCHPO is for the time being in force.
7. The majority of residential care homes hold a licence issued under the RCHEO.  However, the RCHEO allows the Director of Social Welfare to exempt a residential care home from holding a licence under certain circumstances.  The RCHEO does not apply to any residential care home maintained and controlled by the Government or the Housing Authority; or any residential care home used or intended for use solely for the purpose of medical treatment; or any residential care  home  or  type  or  description  of  residential  care  home  excluded  by  the Director of Social Welfare by order published in the Gazette.

8. Under the HNMRO, any person who intends to operate a health care institution in the form of a private hospital, maternity home or nursing home must  obtain  prior  approval  from  the  Director  of  Health  and  should  be  duly registered.  Any nursing home registered under the HNMRO is a residential care home for the purposes of the elderly residential care expenses deduction. The HNMRO will be repealed after the  coming  into  effect  of  section  148  of  the Private Heathcare Facilities Ordinance (Cap. 633) (PHFO) on 1 January 2021. Nursing  house  previously  registered  under  the  HNMRO  will  be  replaced  by scheduled nursing home within the meaning of the PHFO.
9. The  RCHPO  provides  for  the  control  of  residential  care  homes  for persons with disabilities through a licensing system administered by the Director of Social Welfare.  The RCHEO and the RCHPO are mutually exclusive.  Any residential care home which falls into the definitions of a residential care home under the RCHEO and the RCHPO is only required to hold one valid licence under either of the two ordinances.

## Qualifying parent or grandparent

## Dependent parent or grandparent

10. A deduction for residential care expenses may be claimed in respect of a person who is a parent or a grandparent of the claimant.  The deduction for residential  care  expenses  is  allowable  in  respect  of  each  qualifying  parent  or grandparent receiving residential care in a residential care home.   A person may be allowed a deduction in respect of more than one parent or grandparent for whom the person has paid residential care expenses subject to the maximum deduction as specified in Schedule 3C for each parent and grandparent.

## Meaning of parent and grandparent

11. The term 'parent or grandparent' has had its meaning in section 26D(5) extended to include not only the claimant's parents and grandparents but also the parents and grandparents of the claimant's spouse.  The definitions of 'parent' and 'grandparent', as they apply to both the person and the person's spouse, are set out in section 2.  These same definitions apply to dependent parent allowance and dependent grandparent allowance.

12. The scope of 'parent' and 'grandparent' is wide.  It embraces not only a  person's  natural  parents  and  grandparents  but  also  any  adoptive  and  step parents and grandparents.  In the case of a deceased spouse, the relationship of the  deceased  spouse's  parent  or  grandparent  with  the  surviving  spouse  is preserved so that notwithstanding that the deceased spouse may  have predeceased his or her parents or grandparents, a deduction for residential care expenses in respect of the deceased spouse's parents and grandparents may be allowed to the surviving spouse if residential care expenses have been paid by that surviving spouse.
13. In section 2(1) of the IRO, 'spouse' is defined to mean a husband or wife whereas 'husband' and 'wife' refer to a married man and married woman respectively.  'Marriage' is also defined in the same section to mean:
3. (a) any marriage recognized by the law of Hong Kong; or
4. (b) any marriage, whether or not so recognized, entered into outside Hong Kong according to the law of the place where it was entered into and between persons having the capacity to do so.

Based  on  the  above  definitions,  'marriage'  was  in  the  past  construed  as  a heterosexual marriage between a man and a woman and parties in a same-sex marriage would be incapable of having a 'spouse'.

14. The definition of 'marriage' shall not, in the case of a marriage which is both potentially and actually polygamous, include marriage between a person and any spouse other than the principal spouse.  If a person has more than one legal spouse under the laws of other places which permit polygamous marriage, only the marriage between the person and the principal spouse is recognized for the purposes of the IRO.
15. In Leung  Chun  Kwong  v  Secretary  for  the  Civil  Service (2019)  22 HKCFAR 127, the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) recognized that the protection of the institution of marriage in Hong  Kong, being heterosexual and monogamous, was a legitimate aim.  However, the differential treatment under the IRO between a person in a heterosexual marriage and a person in a same-sex marriage entered into outside Hong Kong was not rationally connected to the legitimate  aim  and  was  not  justified.    As  a  relief,  the  CFA  considered  that  a

remedial interpretation of the IRO was appropriate and ordered the following declaration:

- (a) the existing limb (b) of the term 'marriage' in section 2 of the IRO shall  be  read  as  'any  marriage,  whether  or  not  so  recognized, entered into outside Hong Kong according to the law of the place where it was entered into and between persons having the capacity to do so, provided where the persons are of the same sex and such a marriage between them would have been a marriage under this Ordinance but for the fact only that they are persons of the same sex, they shall be deemed for the purposes of such a marriage to have the capacity to do so'; and
- (b) for the purposes of the IRO, references to:
- (i) 'husband and wife' shall be read as 'a married person and his or her spouse';
- (ii) 'not being a wife living apart from her husband' shall be read as 'not being a spouse living apart from the married person'; and
- (iii) 'either  the  husband  or  wife'  shall  be  read  as  'either  the married person or his or her spouse'.

Therefore,  for  the  purposes  of  the  IRO,  a  parent  or  grandparent  includes  the parent or grandparent of a person's spouse, whether in a heterosexual marriage or same-sex marriage.

## Age of parent or grandparent

16. To qualify for the deduction for residential care expenses, the parent or grandparent in respect of whom the expenses are paid must be aged 60 years or more  at  any  time  in  the  year  of  assessment.    In  the  year  that  a  parent  or grandparent attains the age of 60 years, the maximum deduction for residential care expenses set out in Schedule 3C is still allowable.  It is not apportioned on a time basis by reference to the periods prior to, and after, the 60th birthday of a parent or grandparent.  Provided that the parent or a grandparent was aged 60 or

more at any time within the year of assessment, subject to the amount of the maximum deduction not being exceeded, the full amount of the residential care expenses paid in that year is allowable as a deduction.

## Example 1

Mr. A's mother started residing in a residential care home on 1 May 2018.  The mother turned 60 years of age on 1 January 2019.  Mr. A paid $85,000 in residential care expenses to the home between 1 May 2018 and 31 March 2019.

Since  his  mother  attained  the  age  of  60  years  during  the  year  of assessment 2018/19, a deduction for $85,000 (i.e. the full amount paid) would be allowable to Mr. A for the year of assessment 2018/19.

17. Special provisions apply to disabled parents and grandparents under 60 years of age.  When such parents and grandparents are receiving residential care and  are  eligible  to  claim  an  allowance  under  the  Government's  Disability Allowance Scheme, a deduction for residential care expenses paid by the person or the person's spouse is allowable under section 26D(1).

## Expenses paid by a person or the person's spouse

18. If a married couple are not living apart from each other, the entitlement to claim the deduction for residential care expenses is not restricted to the person responsible for making payment to the residential care home.   A deduction may be claimed for payments made by a married person or the person's spouse.  The only  restriction  on  claiming  the  deduction  is  that,  for  any  one  parent  or grandparent, the full entitlement must be claimed by one person.  The deduction cannot be divided between a married couple such that each claims a part of the overall deduction allowable.  In the case of a polygamous marriage, deduction is only allowed in respect of the elderly residential care expenses paid by a person and the person's principal spouse for their parent or grandparent.
19. When  more  than  one  parent  or  grandparent  of  a  married  couple  is residing in a residential care home, each spouse may claim a deduction for the residential care expenses paid for a different parent or grandparent.  Equally, there is no requirement, on an ongoing basis, for the same person to claim the

residential care expenses deduction in respect of the same parent or grandparent every year.  Each year is viewed on a standalone basis and the persons who are eligible to claim the deduction are free, from year to year, to determine who will claim the deduction for that year.

## Expenses paid in the year

20. The allowance of the concessionary deduction is based on payments made within the year of assessment.  The deduction is allowed in the year of assessment in which payment is made and not, where the liability was incurred in an earlier year of assessment, the year of assessment in which liability for the expense actually arose.  Where an expense is incurred in one year of assessment but not paid until the subsequent year, the deduction can only be allowed in the year of payment.

## Example 2

Ms. B's grandfather, aged 80 years, was admitted into a residential care home  on  1  February  2019.    The  monthly  fee  for  his  care  and maintenance of $8,000 was payable monthly in arrears.  The fees for February 2019 and March 2019 were paid on 1 March 2019 and 1 April 2019 respectively.

Since  $8,000  was  paid  in  the  year  of  assessment  2018/19,  only  this amount could be claimed as a deduction by Ms. B in 2018/19.

## Maximum deduction

21. Persons are only entitled to claim a deduction for the actual expenditure paid  by  them  in  the  year  of  assessment  for  the  residential  care  of  qualifying parents or grandparents.  The maximum deduction that may be allowed in any year in respect of each qualifying parent or grandparent is specified in Schedule 3C to the IRO.

## Multiple claims in respect of the same parent or grandparent

22. Section 26D(4)(a) provided that in respect of any parent or grandparent, a residential care expenses deduction can only be allowed to one person in any

year  of  assessment.    It  is  not  possible,  for  example,  for  several  brothers  and sisters to apportion the deduction in respect of any one parent or grandparent amongst themselves as multiple claimants even though the amount claimed, in aggregate,  does  not  exceed  either  the  expenditure  actually  incurred  or  the maximum deduction.  Where more than one person contributes to the payment of the residential care expenses of a parent or grandparent, it is necessary for the persons who have contributed to agree amongst themselves as to which of them will claim the residential care expenses for the year of assessment in question.

23. Two or more persons, other than a married couple not living apart from each  other,  may  each  partially  contribute  to  the  maintenance  of  a  parent  or grandparent by way of the payment of separate invoices issued by the residential care home.  The person who claims the deduction for that year is only entitled to claim a deduction for the amount actually paid by that person and/or the person's spouse.    The  amounts  paid  to  the  residential  care  home  by  the  other  joint contributors other than the person making the claim and/or the person's spouse cannot be included in the person's claim.  Where only a single invoice or account is  issued  by  the  residential  care  home  to  one  person  and  one  or  more  other persons also contribute to its payment, the person with obligation for the payment (i.e. the person named in the invoice or account) will be regarded as the person who made the payment.  Subject to the maximum deduction not being exceeded, that person or that person's spouse will be entitled to claim a deduction for the total amount paid.
24. Sections 33(2) to (4) of the IRO enable the Commissioner to resolve situations where two or more persons are claiming, or have been allowed, an allowance under Part 5 of the IRO in respect of the same qualifying dependant, or it appears to the Commissioner that two or more persons are eligible to claim an allowance for the same qualifying dependant for that year.  These provisions, suitably modified, also apply to the elderly residential care expenses deduction under section 26D(4)(b).  Where two or more persons are claiming, or have been allowed,  a  deduction  for  residential  care  expenses  of  the  same  parent  or grandparent,  the  Commissioner  will  invite  those  persons  to  agree  amongst themselves as to which of them will claim the deduction.  In the event that they are unable to agree, the Commissioner will consider the deduction in a manner that, having  regard  to the information  available to him,  is just in the circumstances.  This may include withdrawing the deduction already granted until the matter has been resolved by the competing claimants.

## Dependent parent allowance or dependent grandparent allowance and elderly residential care expenses

25. The deduction for elderly residential care expenses is allowed in respect of parents and grandparents who, with financial support provided by the family member, are unable to live independently or cannot be provided with care and support  within  a  family  environment.    The  deduction  for  residential  care expenses  is  allowed  as  an  alternative  to  the  granting  of  a  dependent  parent allowance or a dependent grandparent allowance for the parent or grandparent concerned. The deduction for elderly residential care expenses takes precedence over the granting of an allowance under Part 5 of the IRO.  Sections 30(5) and 30A(5) provide that when a deduction for elderly residential care expenses has been allowed in respect of a parent or grandparent, no person can be granted a dependent parent allowance or dependent grandparent allowance in respect of that parent or grandparent.
26. Situations may arise where a person's parent or grandparent is residing in  a  residential  care  home  but  the  home's  fees  charged  are  fully  met  by  that parent's or grandparent's allowance under the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme.  The person has, however, still contributed money towards the  maintenance  of  the  parent  or  grandparent  during  the  year.    In  such circumstances, the person is not entitled to a residential care expenses deduction because he or she has not paid for any such expenses.  However, the person may claim  dependent  parent  allowance  or  dependent  grandparent  allowance  in respect of the parent or grandparent provided that all the relevant conditions are satisfied.  This includes making a contribution of not less than $12,000 in money during  the  year  of  assessment  towards  the  maintenance  of  the  parent  or grandparent concerned.

## Review of deduction claim

27. This  Department  may  request  a  person  to  provide  documentary evidence, such as the receipts issued by a residential care home, in support of the deduction claim.  If necessary, this Department may obtain information from other Government departments to verify whether a person is entitled to claim for deduction of elderly residential care expenses, dependent parent allowance or dependent grandparent allowance in respect of a parent or grandparent.
